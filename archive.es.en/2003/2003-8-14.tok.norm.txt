security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .
the theological exchange is one thing , while the brutal death threat is another entirely unacceptable response .
instead of reacting in a knee-jerk fashion and sentencing people with a different opinion to death , the afghan clerics should engage in a sincere , verbal discussion about the correct interpretation of islam . the director-general of the deutsche welle , erik bettermann , was right to protest publicly against the death sentence .
he described it as a " severe blow to the basic right to press freedom " and an " alarming step backwards in the development of a civil society in afghanistan . " germany is inclined to support the development of civil society in afghanistan and , along with 31 other states , including 17 nato members , is taking a great risk by deploying troops as part of isaf .
but the governments and the people from the countries participating are certainly not prepared to help an afghanistan that is ruled by radical powers looking toward the past . günter knabe heads up deutsche welle 's asian language radio program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .
the theological exchange is one thing , while the brutal death threat is another entirely unacceptable response .
instead of reacting in a knee-jerk fashion and sentencing people with a different opinion to death , the afghan clerics should engage in a sincere , verbal discussion about the correct interpretation of islam . the director-general of the deutsche welle , erik bettermann , was right to protest publicly against the death sentence .
he described it as a " severe blow to the basic right to press freedom " and an " alarming step backwards in the development of a civil society in afghanistan . " germany is inclined to support the development of civil society in afghanistan and , along with 31 other states , including 17 nato members , is taking a great risk by deploying troops as part of isaf .
but the governments and the people from the countries participating are certainly not prepared to help an afghanistan that is ruled by radical powers looking toward the past . günter knabe heads up deutsche welle 's asian language radio program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .
" there ’ s no u.n. model that can be comparable with afghanistan .
that ’ s why it makes no sense to theorize about it .

a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .
fans of helmut rahn now have a newly-released film by which to remember the legend and his goal . tied at two apiece , german striker helmut rahn took the pass from his midfielder as time wound down and shot it through a maze of hungarian defenders into the goal , winning the country the world cup less than a decade after the end of world war ii . rahn 's goal at the 1954 world cup in bern , switzerland , was instantly etched into the collective memory of a devastated country .
the " miracle of bern " not only secured germany 's first world cup , it fed the country 's resilience and restored a pride that had been corrupted by the nazi regime . the goal assured rahn 's place in the pantheon of german sports gods , making the news of his passing thursday after a long illness all the more devastating for today 's sporting heroes . " rahn was and is one of the last legends , " said his colleague in germany 's soccer hall of fame , franz beckenbauer . " he shaped an entire generation .

following the end of a successful soccer career in germany in 1965 , he opened up a used car business with his brother .
he withdrew from the soccer scene , and stopped giving interviews years ago . after the film 's sneak preview wednesday night , wortmann and current national team coach rudi völler had dinner and were discussing how to lure rahn out of his hometown of essen for an upcoming preview when the news came . völler said he was " very saddened " and announced that his team will wear black armbands in their game against italy next week . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links miracle of bern film site 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .

mathias brodkorb , a young social democrat member of the state parliament planned to read an extract from the controversial book at a large youth gathering in the town of prora later this month under the title " hitler at midnight . "
however , conservative right-wing parliamentarian michael ankermann has demanded a stop to the event and said it was a sign of political immaturity when " extracts from the sorry creation by the most terrible german are read out during a ghost storytelling night " at a frivolous youth event .
ankermann added that the ban on hitler ’ s book in germany didn ’ t exist without reason .
brodkorb , however , said disallowing the circulation of " mein kampf " in germany was not in touch with the times , especially as the book is available so freely in the united states or israel .
brodkorb has called for an end to the " secretiveness " surrounding the book and pushed for an open debate . more briefs 14.08.2003 -pipe- schröder doesn ’ t want a “ terminator ” in his cabinet 13.08.2003 -pipe- dresden remembers catastrophic floods 13.08.2003 -pipe- german prostitute faces charges of running call girl ring 13.08.2003 -pipe- german-italian ties on the mend 13.08.2003 -pipe- mental wall still divides west and east germans 03.02.2003 -pipe- e.on faces new problems with takeover 28.01.2003 -pipe- german federal tax revenues climb unexpectedly 28.01.2003 -pipe- germans prepare to lead force 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday proudly announced his cabinet 's passage of landmark welfare reforms aimed at boosting the ailing economy .
but will the chancellor 's agenda 2010 offer too little , too late ? now as much as ever , the world ’ s third-largest economy needs reform .
the latest data , released on thursday , show germany 's gross domestic product shrank in the second quarter of 2003 , officially pushing the economy back into recession . despite general agreement some kind of reforms are urgently needed to spark growth , the conservative opposition has attacked schröder ’ s package of painful welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
and since the christian democrats control the upper house of parliament , the chancellor ’ s so-called agenda 2010 is likely have a rough legislative ride ahead of it . the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens had hoped to stimulate growth by bringing forward to 2004 € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 17.6 billion -rrb- of tax cuts planned for 2005 .
but the cabinet proposed financing the tax cuts mostly through new borrowing , raising fears it will breach european union budget deficit rules again next year .
it also says it will cover some of the cost by curbing tax breaks and subsidies . the measures adopted by the cabinet will affect private home owners and builders as well as commuters , as both groups would lose tax allowances .
in addition , the plan calls for a new municipal business tax on the self-employed , as well as a reduction in currently generous unemployment benefits , bringing them down to the level of welfare benefits .
it is hoped that the move will encourage the unemployed to be more active in seeking a job . the main christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition says the tax cuts should be financed by slashing government spending and that ending tax breaks for home owners and others will create a fiscal drag on the economy by some € 34 billion between 2005 and 2007 .
since many of the reforms and the tax cuts proposed by schröder affect the finances of germany ’ s 16 states , which are represented in the upper house the bundesrat , will have to be approved by the opposition . home-team doubts but even among ruling coalition members , there are doubts that the reform package will achieve its goal of spurring the economy and lowering unemployment , and it is unlikely to leave the bundestag in its current form . heide simonis , social democratic premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , criticized the package , saying the reform of municipal funding , the labor market and income taxes " can hardly be called a unified whole . "
in the end , she said , expenditures would be intolerable for state and local governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin göring-eckardt and greens party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt told the thüringer allgemeinen newspaper that the measures would " in no way leave the bundestag in this form , " without rent and interest income taken into account for those paying local commercial tax . following the vote , schröder called for " constructive cooperation " between the red-green coalition , the opposition , and the states .
speaking on the ard television , he said the ruling coalition is " ready to talk , " and advised the cdu to unify behind a consistent policy . " just saying no , just making a blockade , " does n't help , schröder said . critics fear bureaucracy yet thuringia 's minister president dieter althaus said he is not interested in any such round table .
" we have talked enough .
our proposals are on the table , those of the government as well .
and now its the bundestag turn , " he said . critics in the cdu say the plan will only serve to creating more bureaucracy , and is also too centralized , not giving enough say to the states . rolf peffekoven , professor of economics at the university of mainz , told deutsche welle he thought an agreement will be extremely unlikely , given the opposition in the bundesrat . he said financing a tax reform via new debt would be a false move .
" normally you would have to finance tax reform through reductions in public spending , " because the german debt is already so high , he said .
he noted that 2004 would be the third year in a row where germany exceeds the three percent budget-deficit rule allowed under the maastricht treaty for euro-zone countries . while he agreed with the government plan to reduce welfare benefits , peffekoven noted that such a scheme will work only if the government and industry can succeed in creating more jobs .
" jobs are made by companies , but companies only make jobs when they can have certain expectations for the future .
and this constant back and forth in fiscal politics has destroyed a lot of that . " distress signals yet even as disagreement continues on how to fix its problems , the german economy continued to show even more signs of distress on thursday .
the federal statistics office reported that german real gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank by 0.1 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months .
gdp in the second quarter also declined 0.6 percent when compared with the same period a year earlier . germany 's gdp had already contracted by 0.2 percent on a quarterly basis in the first quarter of 2003 and stagnated in the last quarter of 2002 .
the new data effectively mean that germany has officially slipped into recession , which is usually defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth . the statistics office blamed the development on weakening exports , as the strong euro made german goods less competitive abroad .

security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .
the theological exchange is one thing , while the brutal death threat is another entirely unacceptable response .
instead of reacting in a knee-jerk fashion and sentencing people with a different opinion to death , the afghan clerics should engage in a sincere , verbal discussion about the correct interpretation of islam . the director-general of the deutsche welle , erik bettermann , was right to protest publicly against the death sentence .
he described it as a " severe blow to the basic right to press freedom " and an " alarming step backwards in the development of a civil society in afghanistan . " germany is inclined to support the development of civil society in afghanistan and , along with 31 other states , including 17 nato members , is taking a great risk by deploying troops as part of isaf .
but the governments and the people from the countries participating are certainly not prepared to help an afghanistan that is ruled by radical powers looking toward the past . günter knabe heads up deutsche welle 's asian language radio program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .

after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .

and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2003 schröder pushes reforms as germany slides into recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerd shows how much the economy has been growing .
german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday proudly announced his cabinet 's passage of landmark welfare reforms aimed at boosting the ailing economy .
but will the chancellor 's agenda 2010 offer too little , too late ? now as much as ever , the world ’ s third-largest economy needs reform .
the latest data , released on thursday , show germany 's gross domestic product shrank in the second quarter of 2003 , officially pushing the economy back into recession . despite general agreement some kind of reforms are urgently needed to spark growth , the conservative opposition has attacked schröder ’ s package of painful welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
and since the christian democrats control the upper house of parliament , the chancellor ’ s so-called agenda 2010 is likely have a rough legislative ride ahead of it . the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens had hoped to stimulate growth by bringing forward to 2004 € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 17.6 billion -rrb- of tax cuts planned for 2005 .
but the cabinet proposed financing the tax cuts mostly through new borrowing , raising fears it will breach european union budget deficit rules again next year .
it also says it will cover some of the cost by curbing tax breaks and subsidies . the measures adopted by the cabinet will affect private home owners and builders as well as commuters , as both groups would lose tax allowances .
in addition , the plan calls for a new municipal business tax on the self-employed , as well as a reduction in currently generous unemployment benefits , bringing them down to the level of welfare benefits .
it is hoped that the move will encourage the unemployed to be more active in seeking a job . the main christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- opposition says the tax cuts should be financed by slashing government spending and that ending tax breaks for home owners and others will create a fiscal drag on the economy by some € 34 billion between 2005 and 2007 .
since many of the reforms and the tax cuts proposed by schröder affect the finances of germany ’ s 16 states , which are represented in the upper house the bundesrat , will have to be approved by the opposition . home-team doubts but even among ruling coalition members , there are doubts that the reform package will achieve its goal of spurring the economy and lowering unemployment , and it is unlikely to leave the bundestag in its current form . heide simonis , social democratic premier of the northern state of schleswig-holstein , criticized the package , saying the reform of municipal funding , the labor market and income taxes " can hardly be called a unified whole . "
in the end , she said , expenditures would be intolerable for state and local governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrin göring-eckardt and greens party parliamentary leader katrin göring-eckardt told the thüringer allgemeinen newspaper that the measures would " in no way leave the bundestag in this form , " without rent and interest income taken into account for those paying local commercial tax . following the vote , schröder called for " constructive cooperation " between the red-green coalition , the opposition , and the states .
speaking on the ard television , he said the ruling coalition is " ready to talk , " and advised the cdu to unify behind a consistent policy . " just saying no , just making a blockade , " does n't help , schröder said . critics fear bureaucracy yet thuringia 's minister president dieter althaus said he is not interested in any such round table .
" we have talked enough .
our proposals are on the table , those of the government as well .
and now its the bundestag turn , " he said . critics in the cdu say the plan will only serve to creating more bureaucracy , and is also too centralized , not giving enough say to the states . rolf peffekoven , professor of economics at the university of mainz , told deutsche welle he thought an agreement will be extremely unlikely , given the opposition in the bundesrat . he said financing a tax reform via new debt would be a false move .
" normally you would have to finance tax reform through reductions in public spending , " because the german debt is already so high , he said .
he noted that 2004 would be the third year in a row where germany exceeds the three percent budget-deficit rule allowed under the maastricht treaty for euro-zone countries . while he agreed with the government plan to reduce welfare benefits , peffekoven noted that such a scheme will work only if the government and industry can succeed in creating more jobs .
" jobs are made by companies , but companies only make jobs when they can have certain expectations for the future .
and this constant back and forth in fiscal politics has destroyed a lot of that . " distress signals yet even as disagreement continues on how to fix its problems , the german economy continued to show even more signs of distress on thursday .
the federal statistics office reported that german real gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank by 0.1 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .
" there ’ s no u.n. model that can be comparable with afghanistan .
that ’ s why it makes no sense to theorize about it .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

ankermann added that the ban on hitler ’ s book in germany didn ’ t exist without reason .
brodkorb , however , said disallowing the circulation of " mein kampf " in germany was not in touch with the times , especially as the book is available so freely in the united states or israel .
brodkorb has called for an end to the " secretiveness " surrounding the book and pushed for an open debate . more briefs 14.08.2003 -pipe- schröder doesn ’ t want a “ terminator ” in his cabinet 13.08.2003 -pipe- dresden remembers catastrophic floods 13.08.2003 -pipe- german prostitute faces charges of running call girl ring 13.08.2003 -pipe- german-italian ties on the mend 13.08.2003 -pipe- mental wall still divides west and east germans 03.02.2003 -pipe- e.on faces new problems with takeover 28.01.2003 -pipe- german federal tax revenues climb unexpectedly 28.01.2003 -pipe- germans prepare to lead force radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .

a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .
fans of helmut rahn now have a newly-released film by which to remember the legend and his goal . tied at two apiece , german striker helmut rahn took the pass from his midfielder as time wound down and shot it through a maze of hungarian defenders into the goal , winning the country the world cup less than a decade after the end of world war ii . rahn 's goal at the 1954 world cup in bern , switzerland , was instantly etched into the collective memory of a devastated country .
the " miracle of bern " not only secured germany 's first world cup , it fed the country 's resilience and restored a pride that had been corrupted by the nazi regime . the goal assured rahn 's place in the pantheon of german sports gods , making the news of his passing thursday after a long illness all the more devastating for today 's sporting heroes . " rahn was and is one of the last legends , " said his colleague in germany 's soccer hall of fame , franz beckenbauer . " he shaped an entire generation . " the legend on the big screen rahn 's death came two days before his 74th birthday and one day after a new feature film dedicated to the " miracle of bern , " was shown in a sneak preview . the film , by german director sönke wortmann , was the first attempt to completely reconstruct the world cup game using modern-day actors . for the film , wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to not only look similar to the members of the german national team , but have significant soccer experience as well . the game scenes needed to be filmed countless times before getting everything down right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das wunder von bern , film von sönke wörtmann , locarno 2003 the mircale of bern , the film -lrb- photo -rrb- debuted to general approval at the locarno film festival this year and pleased soccer and film critics alike . " the cardinal problem in soccer films has been solved , the actors are finally believable , " said phillip köster , editor-in-chief of the soccer culture magazine " 11 freunde . " rahn never saw film re-make rahn died before he could see himself immortalized on celluloid .
following the end of a successful soccer career in germany in 1965 , he opened up a used car business with his brother .
he withdrew from the soccer scene , and stopped giving interviews years ago . after the film 's sneak preview wednesday night , wortmann and current national team coach rudi völler had dinner and were discussing how to lure rahn out of his hometown of essen for an upcoming preview when the news came . völler said he was " very saddened " and announced that his team will wear black armbands in their game against italy next week . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links miracle of bern film site media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .
" there ’ s no u.n. model that can be comparable with afghanistan .
that ’ s why it makes no sense to theorize about it .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .

germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .

he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .

a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .
fans of helmut rahn now have a newly-released film by which to remember the legend and his goal . tied at two apiece , german striker helmut rahn took the pass from his midfielder as time wound down and shot it through a maze of hungarian defenders into the goal , winning the country the world cup less than a decade after the end of world war ii . rahn 's goal at the 1954 world cup in bern , switzerland , was instantly etched into the collective memory of a devastated country .
the " miracle of bern " not only secured germany 's first world cup , it fed the country 's resilience and restored a pride that had been corrupted by the nazi regime . the goal assured rahn 's place in the pantheon of german sports gods , making the news of his passing thursday after a long illness all the more devastating for today 's sporting heroes . " rahn was and is one of the last legends , " said his colleague in germany 's soccer hall of fame , franz beckenbauer . " he shaped an entire generation . " the legend on the big screen rahn 's death came two days before his 74th birthday and one day after a new feature film dedicated to the " miracle of bern , " was shown in a sneak preview . the film , by german director sönke wortmann , was the first attempt to completely reconstruct the world cup game using modern-day actors . for the film , wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to not only look similar to the members of the german national team , but have significant soccer experience as well . the game scenes needed to be filmed countless times before getting everything down right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das wunder von bern , film von sönke wörtmann , locarno 2003 the mircale of bern , the film -lrb- photo -rrb- debuted to general approval at the locarno film festival this year and pleased soccer and film critics alike . " the cardinal problem in soccer films has been solved , the actors are finally believable , " said phillip köster , editor-in-chief of the soccer culture magazine " 11 freunde . " rahn never saw film re-make rahn died before he could see himself immortalized on celluloid .
following the end of a successful soccer career in germany in 1965 , he opened up a used car business with his brother .
he withdrew from the soccer scene , and stopped giving interviews years ago . after the film 's sneak preview wednesday night , wortmann and current national team coach rudi völler had dinner and were discussing how to lure rahn out of his hometown of essen for an upcoming preview when the news came . völler said he was " very saddened " and announced that his team will wear black armbands in their game against italy next week . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links miracle of bern film site 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "

security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "

a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .
fans of helmut rahn now have a newly-released film by which to remember the legend and his goal . tied at two apiece , german striker helmut rahn took the pass from his midfielder as time wound down and shot it through a maze of hungarian defenders into the goal , winning the country the world cup less than a decade after the end of world war ii . rahn 's goal at the 1954 world cup in bern , switzerland , was instantly etched into the collective memory of a devastated country .
the " miracle of bern " not only secured germany 's first world cup , it fed the country 's resilience and restored a pride that had been corrupted by the nazi regime . the goal assured rahn 's place in the pantheon of german sports gods , making the news of his passing thursday after a long illness all the more devastating for today 's sporting heroes . " rahn was and is one of the last legends , " said his colleague in germany 's soccer hall of fame , franz beckenbauer . " he shaped an entire generation . " the legend on the big screen rahn 's death came two days before his 74th birthday and one day after a new feature film dedicated to the " miracle of bern , " was shown in a sneak preview . the film , by german director sönke wortmann , was the first attempt to completely reconstruct the world cup game using modern-day actors . for the film , wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to not only look similar to the members of the german national team , but have significant soccer experience as well . the game scenes needed to be filmed countless times before getting everything down right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das wunder von bern , film von sönke wörtmann , locarno 2003 the mircale of bern , the film -lrb- photo -rrb- debuted to general approval at the locarno film festival this year and pleased soccer and film critics alike . " the cardinal problem in soccer films has been solved , the actors are finally believable , " said phillip köster , editor-in-chief of the soccer culture magazine " 11 freunde . " rahn never saw film re-make rahn died before he could see himself immortalized on celluloid .
following the end of a successful soccer career in germany in 1965 , he opened up a used car business with his brother .
he withdrew from the soccer scene , and stopped giving interviews years ago . after the film 's sneak preview wednesday night , wortmann and current national team coach rudi völler had dinner and were discussing how to lure rahn out of his hometown of essen for an upcoming preview when the news came . völler said he was " very saddened " and announced that his team will wear black armbands in their game against italy next week . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links miracle of bern film site 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .
" there ’ s no u.n. model that can be comparable with afghanistan .
that ’ s why it makes no sense to theorize about it .

mathias brodkorb , a young social democrat member of the state parliament planned to read an extract from the controversial book at a large youth gathering in the town of prora later this month under the title " hitler at midnight . "
however , conservative right-wing parliamentarian michael ankermann has demanded a stop to the event and said it was a sign of political immaturity when " extracts from the sorry creation by the most terrible german are read out during a ghost storytelling night " at a frivolous youth event .
ankermann added that the ban on hitler ’ s book in germany didn ’ t exist without reason .
brodkorb , however , said disallowing the circulation of " mein kampf " in germany was not in touch with the times , especially as the book is available so freely in the united states or israel .
brodkorb has called for an end to the " secretiveness " surrounding the book and pushed for an open debate . more briefs 14.08.2003 -pipe- schröder doesn ’ t want a “ terminator ” in his cabinet 13.08.2003 -pipe- dresden remembers catastrophic floods 13.08.2003 -pipe- german prostitute faces charges of running call girl ring 13.08.2003 -pipe- german-italian ties on the mend 13.08.2003 -pipe- mental wall still divides west and east germans 03.02.2003 -pipe- e.on faces new problems with takeover 28.01.2003 -pipe- german federal tax revenues climb unexpectedly 28.01.2003 -pipe- germans prepare to lead force 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .

mathias brodkorb , a young social democrat member of the state parliament planned to read an extract from the controversial book at a large youth gathering in the town of prora later this month under the title " hitler at midnight . "
however , conservative right-wing parliamentarian michael ankermann has demanded a stop to the event and said it was a sign of political immaturity when " extracts from the sorry creation by the most terrible german are read out during a ghost storytelling night " at a frivolous youth event .
ankermann added that the ban on hitler ’ s book in germany didn ’ t exist without reason .
brodkorb , however , said disallowing the circulation of " mein kampf " in germany was not in touch with the times , especially as the book is available so freely in the united states or israel .
brodkorb has called for an end to the " secretiveness " surrounding the book and pushed for an open debate . more briefs 14.08.2003 -pipe- schröder doesn ’ t want a “ terminator ” in his cabinet 13.08.2003 -pipe- dresden remembers catastrophic floods 13.08.2003 -pipe- german prostitute faces charges of running call girl ring 13.08.2003 -pipe- german-italian ties on the mend 13.08.2003 -pipe- mental wall still divides west and east germans 03.02.2003 -pipe- e.on faces new problems with takeover 28.01.2003 -pipe- german federal tax revenues climb unexpectedly 28.01.2003 -pipe- germans prepare to lead force 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .
the theological exchange is one thing , while the brutal death threat is another entirely unacceptable response .
instead of reacting in a knee-jerk fashion and sentencing people with a different opinion to death , the afghan clerics should engage in a sincere , verbal discussion about the correct interpretation of islam . the director-general of the deutsche welle , erik bettermann , was right to protest publicly against the death sentence .
he described it as a " severe blow to the basic right to press freedom " and an " alarming step backwards in the development of a civil society in afghanistan . " germany is inclined to support the development of civil society in afghanistan and , along with 31 other states , including 17 nato members , is taking a great risk by deploying troops as part of isaf .
but the governments and the people from the countries participating are certainly not prepared to help an afghanistan that is ruled by radical powers looking toward the past . günter knabe heads up deutsche welle 's asian language radio program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

" rahn was and is one of the last legends , " said his colleague in germany 's soccer hall of fame , franz beckenbauer . " he shaped an entire generation . " the legend on the big screen rahn 's death came two days before his 74th birthday and one day after a new feature film dedicated to the " miracle of bern , " was shown in a sneak preview . the film , by german director sönke wortmann , was the first attempt to completely reconstruct the world cup game using modern-day actors . for the film , wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to not only look similar to the members of the german national team , but have significant soccer experience as well . the game scenes needed to be filmed countless times before getting everything down right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : das wunder von bern , film von sönke wörtmann , locarno 2003 the mircale of bern , the film -lrb- photo -rrb- debuted to general approval at the locarno film festival this year and pleased soccer and film critics alike . " the cardinal problem in soccer films has been solved , the actors are finally believable , " said phillip köster , editor-in-chief of the soccer culture magazine " 11 freunde . " rahn never saw film re-make rahn died before he could see himself immortalized on celluloid .
following the end of a successful soccer career in germany in 1965 , he opened up a used car business with his brother .
he withdrew from the soccer scene , and stopped giving interviews years ago . after the film 's sneak preview wednesday night , wortmann and current national team coach rudi völler had dinner and were discussing how to lure rahn out of his hometown of essen for an upcoming preview when the news came . völler said he was " very saddened " and announced that his team will wear black armbands in their game against italy next week . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links miracle of bern film site 9801 dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.08.2003 an afghan mission with risks or total chaos ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos in the provinces threatens to overwhelm the afghan capital , kabul .
security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .
the theological exchange is one thing , while the brutal death threat is another entirely unacceptable response .
instead of reacting in a knee-jerk fashion and sentencing people with a different opinion to death , the afghan clerics should engage in a sincere , verbal discussion about the correct interpretation of islam . the director-general of the deutsche welle , erik bettermann , was right to protest publicly against the death sentence .
he described it as a " severe blow to the basic right to press freedom " and an " alarming step backwards in the development of a civil society in afghanistan . " germany is inclined to support the development of civil society in afghanistan and , along with 31 other states , including 17 nato members , is taking a great risk by deploying troops as part of isaf .
but the governments and the people from the countries participating are certainly not prepared to help an afghanistan that is ruled by radical powers looking toward the past . günter knabe heads up deutsche welle 's asian language radio program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .

security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .
the theological exchange is one thing , while the brutal death threat is another entirely unacceptable response .
instead of reacting in a knee-jerk fashion and sentencing people with a different opinion to death , the afghan clerics should engage in a sincere , verbal discussion about the correct interpretation of islam . the director-general of the deutsche welle , erik bettermann , was right to protest publicly against the death sentence .
he described it as a " severe blow to the basic right to press freedom " and an " alarming step backwards in the development of a civil society in afghanistan . " germany is inclined to support the development of civil society in afghanistan and , along with 31 other states , including 17 nato members , is taking a great risk by deploying troops as part of isaf .
but the governments and the people from the countries participating are certainly not prepared to help an afghanistan that is ruled by radical powers looking toward the past . günter knabe heads up deutsche welle 's asian language radio program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .

security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .
the theological exchange is one thing , while the brutal death threat is another entirely unacceptable response .
instead of reacting in a knee-jerk fashion and sentencing people with a different opinion to death , the afghan clerics should engage in a sincere , verbal discussion about the correct interpretation of islam . the director-general of the deutsche welle , erik bettermann , was right to protest publicly against the death sentence .
he described it as a " severe blow to the basic right to press freedom " and an " alarming step backwards in the development of a civil society in afghanistan . " germany is inclined to support the development of civil society in afghanistan and , along with 31 other states , including 17 nato members , is taking a great risk by deploying troops as part of isaf .
but the governments and the people from the countries participating are certainly not prepared to help an afghanistan that is ruled by radical powers looking toward the past . günter knabe heads up deutsche welle 's asian language radio program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "
and with applause ringing throughout the hall , popkomm 2003 opened with its first good idea , with many hoping it would turn out to be more than just that . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sing it loud , proud and in german the german government and the music industry are in favor of a quota for german language songs on public radio in an attempt to revive the popularity of mother tongue artists and boost the creative economy -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2003 popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sound of music at popkomm 2003 in cologne .
the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music . no one could have blamed the atmosphere at the 15th popkomm if it turned out to be a little negative .
the final year of its residency in cologne before it departs for berlin would be reason enough for sadness among those who have regularly visited the world ’ s largest music conference in its traditional home .
add to that the rather depressed nature of the music industry in germany , and it becomes a natural assumption that the annual celebration of creativity and business should have whimpered its way into the annals of cologne ’ s history rather than go out with a bang .
instead , the conference opened with high spirits and talk focussed on the future , not on the past .
the introductory speech , given by a surprisingly upbeat wolfgang clement , the federal minister for economics and labor , was expected by many to bemoan the current struggles that have beset the music industry .
but clement , jocular and relaxed before a large crowd , dismissed the negative statistics and delivered positive words and determined plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement wants to help promote the german music industry .
the government steps in referring to his long association with the conference , clement called popkomm " a 15-year-old child who is now reaching puberty . "
and like any child of this age , it will not look back at what has gone before , but will look towards the future .
the anniversary event , he said , gave reason to look at the crisis in the music industry with a vision not of problems to come , but new challenges and new beginnings .
with the music industry closing ranks to protect itself against copyright infringements , musical piracy and depleting sales , and with most of germany ’ s music infrastructure uprooting to berlin in an attempt to establish a cultural capital in the geographical one , it is time for the government to step in .
in clement ’ s opinion , the government is ready to do just that .
before unveiling the proposals that will no doubt be touted as the berlin administration ’ s 7th cavalry coming to the aid of the music industry , clement delivered the grim , bare facts of the situation .
music industry malaise it read like a check list on a misfiring machine .
the german record industry pulls in 15 billion euros a year for the economy .
it is a major employer with over 100,000 people involved in the various aspects of the business .
plus , the music industry influences the economic well-being of a lot of associated sectors ; media , fashion and retail to name but a few .
but despite these facts , the german music industry has been left to spiral into a depression which has seen record sales slump by 11.3 percent and sales decrease by over 1 billion euros .
germany has dropped from the fourth largest music economy to the fifth over the last two years .
despite quoting the on-going battle with bootlegging , illegal copying and the general depressed state of the german economy as reasons for the current malaise , clement moved his speech towards steps to combat the downward slide .
" people ask me what my concept for the music industry is .
i have to be honest and say i don ’ t have one , " said clement .
" but what we do have is a solid creative base to build on and we must rely on this . "
he added that the industry should embrace new technologies and the creation of new products .
regulating internet music exchange if there is a need among the people to download music , he said , then this trend should be countered by offering alternatives .
it was at this point that clement announced that a draft agreement had been signed by german record companies to provide the world ’ s first regulated music download option the night before .
" let ’ s hope this is something concrete , not just on paper , " he said .
turning his thoughts to the artists and representation , he added , " creativity , and its promotion , is key . "
the media , clement said , has a responsibility to the music industry as one of its main partners to promote german artists and products .
the frequently discussed radio quota , where german language songs and material from new acts would get more airplay on public radio stations , was mentioned as one way of aiding the industry .
the radio quota " is not about nationalism , it ’ s about strengthening the position of the artists and giving them much needed access to a new audience . "
bringing his speech to a close , clement made his boldest statements on the state of germany ’ s music export industry , an untapped and unexplored area of potential growth .
" are we doing enough to promote our product ?
the answer must be no .
we look back and we see many missed opportunities to form a specialized export office and a lack of a coordinated approach . "
exporting german music quoting a government report that states that the german music industry would benefit from an export office to the tune of 160 percent of potential growth , he added , " let ’ s stop talking about it .
let ’ s start doing it .
let ’ s set this office up and talk about the money later .
i propose that over the next few days we all work towards a first draft for an export office . "

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .
" there ’ s no u.n. model that can be comparable with afghanistan .
that ’ s why it makes no sense to theorize about it .

the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .
chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . " faced with mounting casualties and costs and keen to offset some of the burden of policing and rebuilding iraq , washington has been lobbying countries to send in peacekeeping troops to help stabilize the country .
thursday ’ s passage of u.n. resolution 1500 on iraq , which was put forth by the united states , is only the latest attempt to rope in the larger international community to reinforce the increasingly difficult task of keeping the peace in iraq .
though some countries such as poland and denmark have consented , others such as france , russia and germany - all members of the united nations security council and opponents to the u.s.-led war on iraq - have insisted they can only consider participating in such a peacekeeping mission under a full u.n. mandate .
diplomats have also made clear the new resolution authorizing the united nations assistance mission in iraq to provide humanitarian assistance and monitor reconstruction efforts won ’ t be enough of a u.n. role to convince countries to send peacekeeping troops to iraq .
though germany has not been approached with any concrete requests for troops from the u.s. , chancellor gerhard schröder has chosen to evade questions on how he would react if faced with a formal request .
no " wild speculations " on iraq deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi governing council on wednesday , the chancellor reiterated his position when he warned against " wild speculations " on a possible german troop deployment in iraq and said nothing had changed regarding germany ’ s refusal of a possible military deployment in iraq .
ahead of thursday ’ s security council vote on the new iraq resolution , schröder welcomed the planned strengthening of a u.n. role in postwar iraq .
" i 'm happy to see that the united nations will be integrated in the responsibility of reconstruction on the basis of a new resolution , " he said .
there was confusion earlier this week when defense minister peter struck said if there was a u.n. resolution supporting peacekeeping operations in iraq , he saw no reason why german troops could not take part in a nato operation in the country .
his comments followed rare praise from u.s. president bush for germany ’ s ongoing military engagement in afghanistan after relations between both countries had plummeted to record lows in recent months .
struck ’ s statements sparked hot denials from schröder ’ s office .
on wednesday in berlin , the chancellor was unequivocal in his statements .
he said it was wrong to immediately speak of the deployment of german soldiers , when one talked of a nato involvement and insisted there were no prerequisites for a deployment .
irrespective of earlier disagreements with the u.s. over the iraq war , the chancellor added there was a " fundamental interest in the success of the postwar process " throughout the western world .
that seemed to cause struck to change tack .
in an interview with the thüringer allgemeinen daily , struck said there were no indications the americans would agree to a security council resolution that would place the administration of iraq in u.n. hands .

security in kabul is getting worse and two journalists were recently sentenced to death there .
the international community , including germany , should put more effort into rebuilding civil society . the command of the international security and assistance force in afghanistan -lrb- isaf -rrb- changed hands on monday .
but the situation in the capital , kabul , and in the rest of country has not changed .
on the contrary , the relative security that the foreign soldiers in kabul were able to create surprisingly quickly at the beginning of their mission seems to be increasingly under threat .
and none of afghanistan 's many problems have been solved . only minimal progress has been made in rebuilding the country .
while aid organizations virtually jostle each other in the capital , displaying how much money they have with their expensive jeeps , the misery of the rural population is as great as it 's ever been . the countryside is largely controlled by provincial rulers , many of whom are former mujahedeen leaders .
they maintain their grip on power with the help of their own armed men .
they use the immense profits they accrue from drug trafficking to pay for weapons , ammunition and private soldiers .
afghanistan has the dubious honor of being the global leader in the opium and heroin markets .
and the regional warlords also fight each other to protect the boundaries of their individual spheres of control . the provincial threat meanwhile , even the optimists among afghanistan 's observers recognize that the taliban 's dark ideas still occupy the minds of many an afghan citizen .
and the chaos in the provinces bodes well for a resurgence of the taliban .
that would suit the remaining al qaeda fighters in afghanistan and in the afghan-pakistani border regions .
the american military is far away from having defeated them all . it 's not just that the battles continue and that attacks on representatives of the transitional government and even on aid organizations , including the un , are carried out more and more frequently in many provinces .
bomb attacks and suicide bombers are on the increase in kabul as well .
the capital - previously an island of relative stability - could yet be overwhelmed by waves of violence from the countryside . the result is that afghanistan 's provinces must be pacified .
after two decades of bloody quarrels , the afghans will hardly put an end to the power struggles and overcome the ethic conflicts on their own .
the wounds are too deep and the appetite for revenge too strong for reconciliation without help from outside .
afghans will not recognize there is a better alternative to the culture of the kalashnikov until reconstruction of the country delivers visible advantages and palpable benefits to all . but afghanistan can only be developed if the weapons outside kabul are also collected and drug crops are at least reduced drastically , thus depriving the provincial power brokers of the basis for their disastrous activities . an extended mandate that is why isaf troops should be stationed in as many parts of the country as possible and as soon as possible .
when they appear with their modern weapons and a mandate that is clearly discernible to every afghan , collect weapons and make peace , a great majority of the population is sure to welcome them . of course , the areas where such a deployment begins must be chosen carefully .
and it would also be wise initially to send a limited number of soldiers to protect regional reconstruction teams in certain cities and areas .
it must , however , be clearly understood that such an expanded deployment is not free of risks .
no one can guarantee that there will not be losses .
fourteen german soldiers have already lost their lives in kabul . if the international community - and germany as part of it - is indeed prepared to accept the risks that the provinces present it must also call on the afghans to return to reason and moderation , as difficult as that may be .
the transitional government in kabul and all afghanis who hold office and power in the capital must do their part .
in multiethnic afghanistan a stabile , durable peace can only be rectified if all ethnic groups and tribes have an adequate share in political power .
the current situation - in which kabul 's ministries are occupied almost exclusively by tajiks , while pashtos , for example , do n't have any key positions - is untenable . death sentence for journalists the death sentence delivered to two afghan journalists and confirmed by supreme court president maulavi fazl-e hadi shinwari is a shocking step backwards that recalls the misdeeds of taliban regime .
in the weekly aftab the two men , sayeed mahdawi and ali reza payam , had criticized what they described as the reactionary interpretation and abuse of islam for political purposes in afghanistan . afghan mullahs have accused them of blasphemy .
the theological exchange is one thing , while the brutal death threat is another entirely unacceptable response .
instead of reacting in a knee-jerk fashion and sentencing people with a different opinion to death , the afghan clerics should engage in a sincere , verbal discussion about the correct interpretation of islam . the director-general of the deutsche welle , erik bettermann , was right to protest publicly against the death sentence .
he described it as a " severe blow to the basic right to press freedom " and an " alarming step backwards in the development of a civil society in afghanistan . " germany is inclined to support the development of civil society in afghanistan and , along with 31 other states , including 17 nato members , is taking a great risk by deploying troops as part of isaf .
but the governments and the people from the countries participating are certainly not prepared to help an afghanistan that is ruled by radical powers looking toward the past . günter knabe heads up deutsche welle 's asian language radio program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

hemant lakhani was arrested in newark , new jersey , after an elaborate sting operation involving russian and uk intelligence which stretched back 18 months .
two other men were charged with helping to fund the alleged deal which was exposed on tuesday when the three were arrested .

mr lakhani was formally charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists and attempting to sell arms without a licence .
wearing a rumpled striped shirt , he said nothing during the seven-minute hearing .
according to the fbi affidavit , the igla missile had been intended as a taster for an eventual batch of 50 and mr lakhani was looking for a down payment of $ 500,000 - or 10 % of the total - having already secured $ 30,000 .
' osama a hero ' president george w bush said the arrest showed that security was tightening in the us .
" the fact that we were able to sting this guy is a pretty good example of what we 're doing in order to protect the american people , " mr bush said .

" on many occasions in recorded conversations he referred to ...
osama bin laden as a hero who had done something right and set the americans straight , " mr christie told reporters after the hearing .
according to the fbi affidavit , which is based on 150 conversations recorded between december 2001 and 13 august 2003 , mr lakhani speaks of shooting down a commercial aircraft to " shake the economy " of the us .
remanded in custody alongside mr lakhani was moinuddeen ahmed hameed , an indian citizen living in malaysia , who was charged with conspiring to operate an illegal money-transmitting business to pay for the imported missile .

shoulder-held surface-to-air missiles were fired unsuccessfully at an israeli airliner as it took off from mombasa in kenya last november in an attack linked to al-qaeda .

the 3,000 tonnes of zinc sulphide on board the mv jambo , which sank off wester ross , is proving too heavy to remove .
the vessel veered off course , struck rocks and sank off the summer isles at the end of june .
the cypriot-registered vessel , carrying zinc concentrate from dublin to norway , also had more than 84 tonnes of marine diesel on board .
estimated time frame the pumping operation to bring the jambo 's main cargo to the surface only started this week .
the salvage team have found that only 3 % of what was being sucked from the ship 's holds was the zinc powder .
the material is so heavy that much of it was falling back to the mv jambo , which is lying in 60 feet of water .
the estimated time frame for bringing up the mineral load was about two weeks , but those working at the wreck said it could take as long as a month .

the 3,000 tonnes of zinc sulphide on board the mv jambo , which sank off wester ross , is proving too heavy to remove .
the vessel veered off course , struck rocks and sank off the summer isles at the end of june .
the cypriot-registered vessel , carrying zinc concentrate from dublin to norway , also had more than 84 tonnes of marine diesel on board .
estimated time frame the pumping operation to bring the jambo 's main cargo to the surface only started this week .
the salvage team have found that only 3 % of what was being sucked from the ship 's holds was the zinc powder .
the material is so heavy that much of it was falling back to the mv jambo , which is lying in 60 feet of water .
the estimated time frame for bringing up the mineral load was about two weeks , but those working at the wreck said it could take as long as a month .

potato researchers at the centre in abergwyngregyn spotted the large , brightly-coloured caterpillar devouring potato leaves in a plot of experimental plants .
the moth , featured in the silence of the lambs film starring anthony hopkins as hannibal lecter , is named after the characteristic skull and crossbones on its back .
the four-inch moth is the largest ever found in the uk and is rarely seen here .
it is more commonly found in southern europe and north africa .
the moth is named because of its skull and crossbones markings " a few adult moths are found each year in uk as illegal immigrants but the caterpillars are almost never seen , " said dr david shaw of the research centre .
" it is not known to breed here as the pupae do not survive our cold winters .
" our staff have removed the caterpillar from the trials for safe keeping and have named it frederick .
" but we will not know if it a fred or a freda until it pupates and emerges as a moth , " he added .
" we continue to feed it with copious quantities of potato leaves so that it can complete its life cycle . "
bee hives dr shaw and his colleagues are part of the sárvári research trust , based at henfaes research centre in abergwyngregyn .
luckily , the group 's research technician , debbie evans , is also moth recorder for gwynedd , so the moth 's presence has been officially recorded .
the caterpillar was found feeding at the university 's research centre a death 's head hawk moth was found on an industrial estate in south wales in may 2000 .
wildlife experts were delighted to discover the moth at the queensway meadows industrial estate in newport , gwent - the first time in 16 years it had been seen in the county .
it is known to enter bee hives to feed on honey where it emits a loud squeak like a queen bee .

a man being arrested was hit with the gun - which uses darts and wires to deliver a disabling 50,000-volt electric shock - three times in an incident in rhyl on wednesday night .
the force said officers had reason to believe the man was armed with a carving knife and he appeared at the door of a property making threats and threw a glass object at police .
after his arrest , the man was examined by a police surgeon for minor injuries but was otherwise fit and well and is being detained at rhyl police station .
bill brereton , north wales police 's deputy chief constable , said officers were called to a domestic incident in which a woman had apparently been stabbed .
he said one man was arrested without incident but the second man barricaded himself into the home .
officers must shout a warning before using the weapon .
" he was clearly threatening violence and was being abusive , " said mr brereton .
" three tasers were fired at him and that put him down . "
he said an investigation into the deployment of three of the weapons at the same would be carried out but he defended the decision to use them .
" it does appear to have been a highly effetive use of force .
the man received no inuries apart from very small puncture wounds where the barbs has stuck in .
" this appears to me to be a violent man who could otherwise have been shot with a lead bullet . "
the taser , which transmits an electrical impulse into the body , is being trialled as a less lethal option for disabling a suspect than conventional firearms .
dog was targeted north wales police began trialling the taser gun , which is intended to provide a non-lethal alternative to firearms , in april this year .
the force joins the metropolitan police and forces in thames valley , northamptonshire and lincolnshire in testing the weapon .
it has used the weapon before , against a dog in tanyfron , near wrexham , which had bitten two people and was about to attack on officer .
the dog was not claimed and was later destroyed .
the gun fires two darts connected to electric cable into the target before a 50,000-volt charge knocks the suspect out .
its introduction follows growing pressure for a " less lethal " weapon to reduce the number of people shot dead by armed police .
concerns about safety but amnesty international say tasers inflict " intolerable pain " and are easily abused .
the civil rights groups also have concerns about the safety of the weapons .
" clearly we are unable to say what the effects are of being hit simultaneously with three taser weapons , " said robert parker , amnesty international uk 's arms campaigner .
" they should only be used where the only alternatives are firearms - and with the same safeguards that apply to the use of firearms , including the use of specially trained officers .
" amnesty international has been asking the uk government for details of any testing carried out on tasers , " he added .
firearms officers have been ordered to shout : " taser !
taser !
taser ! " before firing at suspects believed to be armed or dangerous .
the rhyl incident has been referred to the police complaints authority as a matter of course .

a man being arrested was hit with the gun - which uses darts and wires to deliver a disabling 50,000-volt electric shock - three times in an incident in rhyl on wednesday night .
the force said officers had reason to believe the man was armed with a carving knife and he appeared at the door of a property making threats and threw a glass object at police .
after his arrest , the man was examined by a police surgeon for minor injuries but was otherwise fit and well and is being detained at rhyl police station .
bill brereton , north wales police 's deputy chief constable , said officers were called to a domestic incident in which a woman had apparently been stabbed .
he said one man was arrested without incident but the second man barricaded himself into the home .
officers must shout a warning before using the weapon .
" he was clearly threatening violence and was being abusive , " said mr brereton .
" three tasers were fired at him and that put him down . "
he said an investigation into the deployment of three of the weapons at the same would be carried out but he defended the decision to use them .
" it does appear to have been a highly effetive use of force .
the man received no inuries apart from very small puncture wounds where the barbs has stuck in .
" this appears to me to be a violent man who could otherwise have been shot with a lead bullet . "
the taser , which transmits an electrical impulse into the body , is being trialled as a less lethal option for disabling a suspect than conventional firearms .
dog was targeted north wales police began trialling the taser gun , which is intended to provide a non-lethal alternative to firearms , in april this year .
the force joins the metropolitan police and forces in thames valley , northamptonshire and lincolnshire in testing the weapon .
it has used the weapon before , against a dog in tanyfron , near wrexham , which had bitten two people and was about to attack on officer .
the dog was not claimed and was later destroyed .
the gun fires two darts connected to electric cable into the target before a 50,000-volt charge knocks the suspect out .
its introduction follows growing pressure for a " less lethal " weapon to reduce the number of people shot dead by armed police .
concerns about safety but amnesty international say tasers inflict " intolerable pain " and are easily abused .
the civil rights groups also have concerns about the safety of the weapons .
" clearly we are unable to say what the effects are of being hit simultaneously with three taser weapons , " said robert parker , amnesty international uk 's arms campaigner .
" they should only be used where the only alternatives are firearms - and with the same safeguards that apply to the use of firearms , including the use of specially trained officers .
" amnesty international has been asking the uk government for details of any testing carried out on tasers , " he added .
firearms officers have been ordered to shout : " taser !
taser !
taser ! " before firing at suspects believed to be armed or dangerous .
the rhyl incident has been referred to the police complaints authority as a matter of course .

the group , owner of the bairstow eves chain of estate agents and property website rightmove.com , said pre-tax profits for the six months to june sank to £ 21.9m from £ 35.8m a year earlier .
countrywide blamed " difficult " property market conditions , saying the housing market had stalled as the iraq war hit housebuyers ' confidence , threatening a period of economic instability .
countrywide also said first time buyers were becoming scarce , which meant that deals were taking longer to complete .
the number of completed property transactions fell 16 % during the first half of the year to just over 37,000 , while the number of mortgages arranged rose 8 % to nearly 25,000 .
rebound but countrywide added that the swift end to the iraq conflict and falling interest rates have reinvigorated the housing market at the start of the second half of the year .
chairman christopher sporborg said : " difficult trading conditions earlier this year focused our attention on cost reduction , particularly in our house agency division .
" fortunately , the market has shown some signs of gentle recovery recently , encouraged , no doubt , by the end of the war in iraq and record low mortgage rates . "
he added : " volumes were down and we are a volume business .
but the july figures were excellent . "
" for the rest of the year , we expect activity to pick up despite a possible moderating of average house price increases and look forward to improved profitability . "
city investors welcomed the firm 's upbeat forecast , marking countrywide shares up 9 % to 132p in early trade .

microsoft 's msn music club allows fans in the uk , france and germany to buy single songs from 75p , or 0.99 euros .
it is being billed as the first pan-european pay-as-you-go online music shop .
apple 's itunes music store , which offers songs for $ 0.99 -lrb- 62p -rrb- , was an instant hit when it launched in the us in may - but microsoft has beaten it to the european market .
through microsoft , fans can buy more than 200,000 songs from all five major record labels - roughly the same as the itunes catalogue .
many tunes are priced at 75p , with more popular songs at 99p and " gold " singles at £ 1.19 .
gold tracks are new singles , available as soon as they are sent to radio stations - up to six weeks before the cds reach shops .
these new services represent the second generation of online music stores in europe charles grimsdale digital music company od2 and full albums will be priced to download from £ 7.99 , or 12.49 euros .
songs are available through the 250 million copies of the latest version of microsoft 's windows media player as well as its website .
the new service was given a " soft launch " last week and is being run in conjunction with digital music company od2 .
there has already been a " dramatic " increase in users after microsoft 's previous subscription-only model was expanded , od2 chief executive charles grimsdale said .
itunes enjoyed surprise success when it launched in the us in may , selling more than five million songs in the first two months .
microsoft 's service was not a direct response to itunes ' popularity , but was designed to please fans who were reluctant to sign up for a subscription , he said .
it had also been made possible because record companies had " opened up " their licensing requirements in the last six months , he said .
burning tracks " these new services represent the second generation of online music stores in europe , " he said .
fans can copy tracks , burn them to cds and transfer them to other devices as much as they want " within reason " , he added .
an apple spokesman could not say when itunes music store was likely to launch in the uk because they were currently negotiating with record companies .
" there are people thrashing out deals as we speak , " he said .
windows itunes he added that itunes used a higher quality audio file and that users had the same level of rights as people who bought cds .
it is currently only available to mac users , but a windows version of itunes is expected to be launched in the us by the end of the year .
the new services are leading the way in legitimate downloading after several years during which unofficial sites have allowed fans to access music for free .
the music industry branded it " piracy " and blamed it for a slump in cd sales .

many tunes are priced at 75p , with more popular songs at 99p and " gold " singles at £ 1.19 .
gold tracks are new singles , available as soon as they are sent to radio stations - up to six weeks before the cds reach shops .
these new services represent the second generation of online music stores in europe charles grimsdale digital music company od2 and full albums will be priced to download from £ 7.99 , or 12.49 euros .
songs are available through the 250 million copies of the latest version of microsoft 's windows media player as well as its website .
the new service was given a " soft launch " last week and is being run in conjunction with digital music company od2 .
there has already been a " dramatic " increase in users after microsoft 's previous subscription-only model was expanded , od2 chief executive charles grimsdale said .
itunes enjoyed surprise success when it launched in the us in may , selling more than five million songs in the first two months .
microsoft 's service was not a direct response to itunes ' popularity , but was designed to please fans who were reluctant to sign up for a subscription , he said .
it had also been made possible because record companies had " opened up " their licensing requirements in the last six months , he said .
burning tracks " these new services represent the second generation of online music stores in europe , " he said .
fans can copy tracks , burn them to cds and transfer them to other devices as much as they want " within reason " , he added .
an apple spokesman could not say when itunes music store was likely to launch in the uk because they were currently negotiating with record companies .
" there are people thrashing out deals as we speak , " he said .
windows itunes he added that itunes used a higher quality audio file and that users had the same level of rights as people who bought cds .
it is currently only available to mac users , but a windows version of itunes is expected to be launched in the us by the end of the year .
the new services are leading the way in legitimate downloading after several years during which unofficial sites have allowed fans to access music for free .
the music industry branded it " piracy " and blamed it for a slump in cd sales .
