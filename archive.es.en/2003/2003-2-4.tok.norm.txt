"
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .
two of them see the government backtracking on previous labor policies a long way .

this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .

falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2003 tackling the reform problems of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still on the search for jobs : germans at the labor office in gelsenkirchen following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems . the word has become as commonplace as the snow on many rooftops this winter in germany : " reform . "
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2003 tackling the reform problems of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still on the search for jobs : germans at the labor office in gelsenkirchen following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems . the word has become as commonplace as the snow on many rooftops this winter in germany : " reform . "
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .

schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2003 tackling the reform problems of germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still on the search for jobs : germans at the labor office in gelsenkirchen following the distrastrous results for the social democrats in sunday 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder will have to rely on his politicial opponents to help solve the country 's pressing problems . the word has become as commonplace as the snow on many rooftops this winter in germany : " reform . "
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .

"
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .

"
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .

but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .
two of them see the government backtracking on previous labor policies a long way .

after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .

"
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .

but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .

"
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .

"
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .
two of them see the government backtracking on previous labor policies a long way .

"
the job market , the health system , the pension system - all are in need of reform .
germany 's transportation minister was among the latest of the country 's political leaders to admit as much this week , while the stinging defeats that his social democratic party suffered in two state elections on sunday continued to smart .
and he knows his boss , chancellor gerhard schröder , is well aware of this , too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe " it is perfectly clear to the chancellor that he must introduce massive reforms , " manfred stolpe told the newspaper die welt in an interview published tuesday .
but it is also perfectly clear to the chancellor - and his political opponents - that he needs their help even more since voters pushed the social democrats out of power in his home state of lower saxony and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute majority in the state of hesse .
he must turn to these opponents because of germany 's system of legislative power-sharing .
under that system , schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens controls the parliament .
but his political foes control the country 's second legislative body , the bundesrat .
this assembly is composed of representatives of the 16 german states and considers about half of the issues that go through the parliament .
as a result of sunday 's vote , the christian democratic union , the christian social union and the small free democratic party strengthened their hold on the bundesrat , and have begun maneuvering for position in the debates over the country 's much-discussed reforms .
because of these changes , the country 's politicians will have to test their skills in creating compromises as they try to reform a system that is being dragged down by sinking tax revenues and rising unemployment .
continuing unemployment one of the most contentious problems is germany 's rising unemployment . joblessness is a root problem of germany 's economy , robbing the country 's of tax revenues and driving up social costs .
the ailing labor market deteriorated further in december , with the monthly unemployment rate rising from 9.7 percent to 10.1 percent .
the country now counts 4.22 million citizens among the jobless , a figure well above the 3.5 million level that chancellor gerhard schröder once promised to reach and a total that exceeds the population of the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
in order to find a solution , the german chancellor has called on an old acquaintance , vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , to head up a commission to finds ways of reforming german ’ s highly regulated labor market .
in august , hartz announced his suggestions , which included the conversion of germany ’ s 181 labor offices into " job centers " that serve as one-stop-shops for the jobless , new pressure on the unemployed who refuse to take jobs offered and the expansion of the temporary work sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz however , the legislative debate on the introduction of some of the hartz proposals did not go smoothly at the end of last year , and a conference committee of lawmakers had to seek a common ground after the opposition raised objections to the plan covering temporary workers .
since then , though , some christian democrats have been endorsing the hartz approach .
at the end of january , the christian democratic premier of saarland , peter müller , pledged to work for the quick passage of the plans .
but others continue to express doubts about schröder 's approach to the problem .
after sunday 's election results were announced , one of the opposition 's leaders spoke out .
" we need a different course .
otherwise , we are going to have 5 million jobless , " said edmund stoiber , who heads the bavarian-based christian social union .
falling tax revenues another main burden to germany 's economy is the large drop in tax revenues . german finance minister hans eichel has to wrestle for months now with the financially draining effects of joblessness .
due partially to unemployment , the government 's tax revenues have fallen , and the country 's budget deficit climbed to € 34.6 billion -lrb- $ 37.6 billion -rrb- last year .
by doing so , it breached a barrier established to protect the stability of the euro , the currency shared by 12 countries in the european union .
in order to boost revenues , eichel has created a 48-point tax plan which among other things , would impose a new tax of 15 percent tax on capital gains made on the sale of stocks and real estate , reduce a subsidy the government pays to people who buy homes and impose the full value-added tax on a list of products that enjoye a lower rate .
with these measures , eichel 's aims to generate € 3.6 billion in revenues this year and up to € 16.7 billion by 2006 .
the christian democrats , however , are united in their opposition to eichel 's plans .
" we will not be raising any taxes during this economic crisis , " said roland koch , the premier in the state of hesse who was re-elected on sunday .
instead , the christian democrats have suggested that the government take a different approach that can form the basis for negotiations .
" every day , that the government sticks to this -lrb- proposal -rrb- is a day that costs jobs , " koch said .
germany 's ailing social system a further main area which is in desperate need of reform is the health system .
employees and employers are watching as rising payments for health insurance , the national pension plan and old-age care eat away at paychecks and smother job-creating possibilities .
the deficit run up by the country 's public health insurance companies is thought to have hit $ 2.5 billion last year .
in response , about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year , according to the newspaper bild am sonntag .
schröder has bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup taken a two-pronged approach on healing the social system 's ongoing ailment .
first , health minister ulla schmidt has been charged with creating a reform that will increase the efficiency and quality of health care in germany .
but she has delayed releasing her ideas , saying she wanted to wait until after sunday 's elections .
that timetable changed on tuesday , when the general secretary of the social democrats , olaf scholz , said the plan would be announced in conjunction with the second part of schröder 's plan , the rürup commission , which could be sometime this spring , scholz said .
the commission was created in november and is headed by the economist bert rürup .
the panel 's goal is to find long-term ways of solidifying the financing of the social system .
" if we ca n't cut the non-labor-related costs , we will be unable to solve our job-creation problem , " rürup said after being selected .
since november , the commission has not presented any concrete solutions , but various members have made public suggestions that have given the country 's citizens an idea about the 26-member group 's thinking .
rürup suggested , for instance , that the retirement age could be raised from 65 to 67 , and commission member bernd raffelhüschen suggested that each insured person could pay up to € 900 out of his or her own pocket for health care .
the christian democrats , however , have serious doubts about the work of the rürup commission , announcing a panel of their own on tuesday that will compete with the chancellor 's group of experts .
the panel 's goal will be to create a " fundamental change of direction " in the social system , the party announced .
the panel is led by former german president roman herzog , who once said a " jolt " was needed to sweep across germany .
herzog 's commission will report its proposals in the fall .
but merkel assured schröder 's government that the opposition still remained open to talks on the issue . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .
two of them see the government backtracking on previous labor policies a long way .

" america 's journey into space will go on , " the president said , after discussions with nasa 's chief administrator on the investigation into what went wrong .

as authorities continued to retrieve debris from the shuttle , nasa officials said latest evidence showed a sudden surge in temperature on the shuttle 's left side as it re-entered earth 's atmosphere , indicating a possible problem with the spacecraft 's protective tiles .
nasa investigators said the shuttle had to use its jets to correct its flight - so great was the drag on the left side of the vehicle in the minutes before its loss .
the new information was released by shuttle programme manager ron dittemore at a media conference at the johnson space center in houston , texas .

mr dittemore also gave extensive details of the analysis engineers undertook when they discovered the orbiter had been struck by insulation foam peeling of the vehicle 's external fuel tank on launch .
all the modelling suggested the event presented no safety risk to the shuttle , he said .
earlier , president mr bush paid tribute to columbia 's crew , saying they would be " remembered for their achievements , their heroism and their sense of wonder " .
" their 16-day mission held the promise of answering scientific problems that elude us here on earth , " he said .
in a statement released through nasa , the astronauts ' families said that despite their deep grief " the bold exploration of space must go on . "
nasa said its primary responsibility was to recover the remains of the crew and return them to their relatives .
remains of some of the astronauts have already been found .

pieces landed over at least a 100 mile area of east texas and louisiana , from fragments to chunks of twisted metal as big as cars .
officials plan to eventually assemble the parts and reconstruct the shuttle to try to establish what happened in its final moments .
but collecting the remains is a monumental task : authorities have so far identified more than 1,200 debris sites in nacogdoches , texas , alone .
" there is no way to describe how many pieces there are and how spread over the landscape they are , " said james kroll , of the geospacial mapping centre at stephen f austin state university in nacogdoches .

but since it was returned to china in 1997 , it has been struggling to find its own identity .
hong kong 's botanical gardens are one of the most pleasant parts of the city centre , a lush , peaceful place , with great views of the skyscrapers .
but this is also a battleground , between the city 's colonial past and its chinese future .
a recent plan to move a statue of britain 's king george vi and place it next to some nearby monkey cages caused an uproar .
patrick hase is the chairman of the royal asiatic society .
" this is an attempt to belittle and downgrade the british side of the history of hong kong .
now hong kong has to develop a new history , new community , a new way forward , but you do that by building , not demolishing , " he said .
the plan was to replace king george with a statue of china 's first president , sun yat sen. dilemma it touched on the central dilemma facing hong kong- how the city redefines itself now it is part of china . "
in hong kong everything got to be quick , quick , quick , fast , fast , fast , you can never stop , you can never sleep , you just have to keep going and going . "
john chang , fashion designer hong kong is still a mercantile , money-making town .
its recent fashion week in the ultra-modern harbour-front convention centre drew thousands from around the world .
john chang , a local designer , is a typical young hong konger , educated abroad , back to make his fortune in china 's most international city .
" i 'm not the only one .
there are so many people who have been studying , or have moved to some other places and who are now back in hong kong to explore their careers , " he said .
hong kong has always been a sort of rootless refugee city .
waves of immigrants from mainland china continue to arrive , along with westerners , asians and overseas chinese coming home .
it has been the source of the city 's energy , but also its insecurity .
john chang explained : " what i do for one day is what i used to do for 3 days in australia .
i mean the pace is very different , in hong kong everything got to be quick , quick , quick , fast , fast , fast , you can never stop , you can never sleep , you just have to keep going and going . "
but since the handover the spring has gone from hong kong 's step .
there have been two recessions , the property and share markets have collapsed .
tom hilditch , the social diarist for the south china morning post newspaper , says the city is facing a crisis of confidence .
" we used to define ourselves through shopping and consuming ... everything we touched turned to gold , we would buy three flats at a time .
now a lot of that consumerist past-time is n't working out , so people do n't have any money and they sit at home wondering what to do , " he said .
since its return to china , tom hilditch says hong kong has lost something of its special role and found nothing to replace it .
" i think hong kong is trying to find itself .
it is neither part of the mainland , nor is it part of the british empire .
it 's this rock floating between two worlds , and people who live on it are trying to decide where they belong , " he said .
self-doubt christine loh , who runs a local think-tank , says the sense of self-doubt is fuelled by the fact china 's other cities like shanghai and beijing appear to be dynamic , booming places , confident the tide of the times is running in their favour .
" when you used to be the most modern city , the richest city in china , and then all these cities seem to be catching up , you think oh maybe i 'm not as good as i was .
now we 're plugged right into a very big country , we 're really lost .
we do n't know that big country very well , they do n't know how we work , and we 're eyeballing each other , " she said .
hong kong is moving to integrate itself far more with mainland china .
but patrick hase , says it remains a place apart .
" the border is still very , very much in place .
it would n't be unfair to say that having been a british colony for 150 years we 're now a chinese colony .
because the way beijing runs hong kong is not wildly dissimilar to the way london did in the past , " he said .
compared to mainland chinese cities , hong kong is still far richer , far freer , and far more developed .
but the move from colonial to chinese rule has proved a wrenching experience , a psychological rupture that could take years to resolve .

until monday , csfb had stood by frank quattrone , head of its once-booming global technology group .
but the bank suspended him after learning that he may have destroyed key documents relating to a number of investigations into the firm .
csfb is coming under regulatory pressure - primarily from the national association of securities dealers -lrb- nasd -rrb- - over the way it allocated shares in some of the most popular flotations during the hi-tech boom of the late 1990s .
it is not clear whether mr quattrone 's suspension was directly related to the nasd case ; the firm only admitted that he was under suspicion over " document retention issues " .
red faces the quattrone case is the latest in a string of embarrassing probes into csfb .
the bank has been sued in new york over allegations that its analysts were biased in the way they tipped shares .
when john mack took over as chief executive in 2001 , he promised to clear up the bank 's wheeler-dealing reputation .
but although mr quattrone was already under investigation at that point , mr mack publicly supported him , and elevated him to the csfb executive board .
csfb , which was arguably the most successful wall street house during the 1990s boom , has suffered sharply since , thanks to its reliance on hi-tech and telecoms-related business .

it may have damaged the shuttle in one of its weakest points - its " achilles heel " - according to one engineer .
in-flight repairs to the tiles would have been hazardous nasa says its best engineers initially concluded that the foam fragment 's impact on the wing would not have any significant effect on the mission 's safety .
even if a few tiles had been damaged , nasa concluded that even though there may have been some damage to columbia during re-entry , there was no question that the space shuttle itself could be lost .
in fact , nasa 's engineers concluded during the flight that it could have caused damage ranging from removal of a single tile to removal of tiles over an area of approximately 20 cm by 80 cm -lrb- 7 by 30 inches -rrb- .
but this probably would not have led to a catastrophic burnthrough , they believe .
vulnerable spot however , despite this analysis , the foam fragment is now officially the prime suspect in the disaster .
some engineers think that the foam fragment hit columbia near the seam of a wheel-well door - one of the most vulnerable spots on the shuttle .
the wheel well door could be the key to the disaster the wheel-well door is the only part of columbia 's underside blanket that opens to allow the landing gear to deploy , a few moments before touchdown .
some are speculating that damage to the tile gap around the wheel-well door caused the fatal damage that was considered statistically unlikely by those engineers .
nasa investigators are considering a series of reports describing several small fiery objects falling off the shuttle during re-entry , followed by a much bigger object as columbia passed over california .
shuttle engineers know that tiles are often damaged by debris - both foam and ice - falling off the external fuel tank .
speaking on american tv , one nasa engineer said that there had been flights in which , on return , " half the tiles on the vehicle were damaged " .
this speculation makes the recovery of debris from the left wing all-important .
already engineers have begun examining the wheel-well area on one of the intact grounded shuttles .
no return the possibility that columbia may have gone into space with unrecognised , and fatal , damage is raising some issues over the way shuttle missions are flown .
the crew of columbia had no way of assessing any potential damage to the underside of their spacecraft .
the detached tile may have caused a freak accident they had no tv cameras which could look in the area .
a spacewalk , even with the right equipment , underneath the shuttle is regarded as too risky .
in previous shuttle missions , spy satellites or high-powered telescopes on the ground have peered at the shuttle to look for damage , but they only have a broad view and can not see individual tiles .
and even if the crew had been aware that columbia was severely damaged in a way which made re-entry impossible , there was probably nothing they could have done about it .
as things stand at the moment , a rescue shuttle could not have been launched in time unless nasa was lucky and also threw away the rule book .
in the early days of the space shuttle programme , nasa considered having a tile repair kit onboard each mission but abandoned the idea because it considered that such repairs in space would not work .
accidents highlight failures and destroy previous assumptions .
the challenger accident did that in 1986 .
it remains to be seen if any of these issues will be addressed during the columbia enquiry .
