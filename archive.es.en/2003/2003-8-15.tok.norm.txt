the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .

according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .
defense lawyers believed binalshibh would be able to show how insignificant a role motassadeq had in the plans . in order to put the authorities under more pressure , mzoudi 's lawyers have said they will discourage their client from saying anything at the trial .
the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .
they also plan to file numerous requests with the court to get binalshibh and other witnesses to testify . not letting in the testimony , say observers , would serious damage the credibility of the trial verdict . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report castigates cia , fbi and germany for 9/11 failures u.s. congressional investigators say the cia and fbi overlooked important clues that could have helped them stop the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.08.2003 u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now welcomed by the international community - the interim governing council of iraq .
the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .

large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems . technicians are struggling to get the lights back on in new york and elsewhere in north america after an unprecedented blackout on thursday , but europe - and germany - have had troubles of their own . the recent heat-wave in europe has taxed energy production facilities across the continent .
the netherlands came dangerously close to large-scale outages and issued its highest level warning for the first time . in germany , several atomic energy facilities , including heiler brunsbüttel , isar i , and obrigheim , reduced output by up to 50 % because the rivers , from which they pull water to cool their facilities , were too warm . environmental conditions also hindered the production of energy from alternative sources : low water levels caused by the drought and calm winds meant energy generated from water and wind could not fill the gap . energy companies assure worried germans energy companies in europe and elsewhere turned to buying extra reserves from the european power exchange , otherwise known as the spot-market , based in leipzig , where peak hour prices doubled to twice their weekly average . yet all through the crisis , utility company executives stressed that - although they were operating at reduced capacity - there was no danger of falling short of the need .
following the crisis in new york , experts reiterated that a similar crisis in germany was highly unlikely . the chairman of the association for energy technology , prof. h. j. wagner said : " our energy-production facilities are secure .
as soon as one generator falls out , another springs into action ; if multiple facilities malfunction , our european neighbors provide us with energy . " prof. wagner went on to explain that the europeans benefit from a networked system , which allows them to draw upon other country 's facilities at times of crisis .
such a network does not exist in the united states . power shortages and higher prices ? but it was n't just fears of power outage that had consumers concerned .
talk that the cost of energy on the openly traded spot-market in leipzig was trading at such astronomical levels also worried consumers not wise to the ways of the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers need n't worry , john lane , an analyst who monitors the european energy market for datamonitor , a london-based consulting firm , told deutsche welle . " the price is not passed on to the consumer , because they pay a flat rate , " said lane .
" but the utility companies take the loss . " one would think that energy companies would , therefore , be motivated to diversify their facilities , by investing in renewable energy , and giving themselves the choice to switch from source to another , depending on environmental conditions .
not so , says lane , because the cost of investing in new facilities is so high .
" it 's more cost effective to take that kind of hit every now and then than to invest in new technology that is not so weather sensitive . " the latter point is up for debate , as the german government is discussing the path of the country 's energy industry .
the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the atomic facilities which proved so troublesome this past week are due to be phased out , but industry executives and those at the environmental ministry are at odds over how to fill the gap - through renewable energy or traditional fossil fuel - and provide reliable energy under all conditions , at the right price for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will power germany in the future ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.08.2003 u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now welcomed by the international community - the interim governing council of iraq .
the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .
before the meeting took place , greenpeace members protested in front of the chancellor 's office , unfurling a transparent that read : " through oil and coal into a climate chaos .

next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .
before the meeting took place , greenpeace members protested in front of the chancellor 's office , unfurling a transparent that read : " through oil and coal into a climate chaos .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .

the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .
defense lawyers believed binalshibh would be able to show how insignificant a role motassadeq had in the plans . in order to put the authorities under more pressure , mzoudi 's lawyers have said they will discourage their client from saying anything at the trial .
the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .
they also plan to file numerous requests with the court to get binalshibh and other witnesses to testify . not letting in the testimony , say observers , would serious damage the credibility of the trial verdict . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report castigates cia , fbi and germany for 9/11 failures u.s. congressional investigators say the cia and fbi overlooked important clues that could have helped them stop the sept .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .
before the meeting took place , greenpeace members protested in front of the chancellor 's office , unfurling a transparent that read : " through oil and coal into a climate chaos .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .
before the meeting took place , greenpeace members protested in front of the chancellor 's office , unfurling a transparent that read : " through oil and coal into a climate chaos .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .
one must surely be resolved before the other can stand a chance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music -lrb- aug .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .

" i don ’ t believe there was ever anybody who was closer to him -lrb- jarrah -rrb- than me , " she said .
" i wanted him to do something that would make him happy in his profession , but in hindsight i have to say that i didn ’ t really know him , " she stressed .
aysel s ’ s testimony came during the start of the trial of 30-year-old moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks .
mzoudi faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people and membership in a terrorist organization and could be sentenced to the maximum 15 years .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .
one must surely be resolved before the other can stand a chance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music -lrb- aug .

the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .
defense lawyers believed binalshibh would be able to show how insignificant a role motassadeq had in the plans . in order to put the authorities under more pressure , mzoudi 's lawyers have said they will discourage their client from saying anything at the trial .
the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .
defense lawyers believed binalshibh would be able to show how insignificant a role motassadeq had in the plans . in order to put the authorities under more pressure , mzoudi 's lawyers have said they will discourage their client from saying anything at the trial .
the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .
they also plan to file numerous requests with the court to get binalshibh and other witnesses to testify . not letting in the testimony , say observers , would serious damage the credibility of the trial verdict . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report castigates cia , fbi and germany for 9/11 failures u.s. congressional investigators say the cia and fbi overlooked important clues that could have helped them stop the sept .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .
before the meeting took place , greenpeace members protested in front of the chancellor 's office , unfurling a transparent that read : " through oil and coal into a climate chaos .

" send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing green energy a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .
the bdv says the german government 's view will not play a decisive role in the final decision of where the center will be housed .
it says it is independent and has already raised significant funds towards building a headquarters for the center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting history in the right place a hot debate has erupted between germany and poland over where to locate a documentation center for the millions of people expelled from poland at the end of world war ii -lrb- may 17 , 2002 -rrb- .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .
one must surely be resolved before the other can stand a chance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.08.2003 expulsion not just a german issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of ethnic germans were expelled from the former german city of breslau after wwii .
plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems . technicians are struggling to get the lights back on in new york and elsewhere in north america after an unprecedented blackout on thursday , but europe - and germany - have had troubles of their own . the recent heat-wave in europe has taxed energy production facilities across the continent .
the netherlands came dangerously close to large-scale outages and issued its highest level warning for the first time . in germany , several atomic energy facilities , including heiler brunsbüttel , isar i , and obrigheim , reduced output by up to 50 % because the rivers , from which they pull water to cool their facilities , were too warm . environmental conditions also hindered the production of energy from alternative sources : low water levels caused by the drought and calm winds meant energy generated from water and wind could not fill the gap . energy companies assure worried germans energy companies in europe and elsewhere turned to buying extra reserves from the european power exchange , otherwise known as the spot-market , based in leipzig , where peak hour prices doubled to twice their weekly average . yet all through the crisis , utility company executives stressed that - although they were operating at reduced capacity - there was no danger of falling short of the need .
following the crisis in new york , experts reiterated that a similar crisis in germany was highly unlikely . the chairman of the association for energy technology , prof. h. j. wagner said : " our energy-production facilities are secure .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .
before the meeting took place , greenpeace members protested in front of the chancellor 's office , unfurling a transparent that read : " through oil and coal into a climate chaos .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .
the bdv says the german government 's view will not play a decisive role in the final decision of where the center will be housed .
it says it is independent and has already raised significant funds towards building a headquarters for the center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting history in the right place a hot debate has erupted between germany and poland over where to locate a documentation center for the millions of people expelled from poland at the end of world war ii -lrb- may 17 , 2002 -rrb- .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.08.2003 what will power germany in the future ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can renewable energy help germany avoid power outages like the one that hit new york ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .
before the meeting took place , greenpeace members protested in front of the chancellor 's office , unfurling a transparent that read : " through oil and coal into a climate chaos .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .
before the meeting took place , greenpeace members protested in front of the chancellor 's office , unfurling a transparent that read : " through oil and coal into a climate chaos .
chancellor , do something ! " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pushing green energy a ruling by germany 's federal court of justice is forcing utility companies to buy renewable energy , even though it costs over ten times more than conventionally-produced power .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .
defense lawyers believed binalshibh would be able to show how insignificant a role motassadeq had in the plans . in order to put the authorities under more pressure , mzoudi 's lawyers have said they will discourage their client from saying anything at the trial .
the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.08.2003 u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now welcomed by the international community - the interim governing council of iraq .
the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .

large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems . technicians are struggling to get the lights back on in new york and elsewhere in north america after an unprecedented blackout on thursday , but europe - and germany - have had troubles of their own . the recent heat-wave in europe has taxed energy production facilities across the continent .
the netherlands came dangerously close to large-scale outages and issued its highest level warning for the first time . in germany , several atomic energy facilities , including heiler brunsbüttel , isar i , and obrigheim , reduced output by up to 50 % because the rivers , from which they pull water to cool their facilities , were too warm . environmental conditions also hindered the production of energy from alternative sources : low water levels caused by the drought and calm winds meant energy generated from water and wind could not fill the gap . energy companies assure worried germans energy companies in europe and elsewhere turned to buying extra reserves from the european power exchange , otherwise known as the spot-market , based in leipzig , where peak hour prices doubled to twice their weekly average . yet all through the crisis , utility company executives stressed that - although they were operating at reduced capacity - there was no danger of falling short of the need .
following the crisis in new york , experts reiterated that a similar crisis in germany was highly unlikely . the chairman of the association for energy technology , prof. h. j. wagner said : " our energy-production facilities are secure .

the netherlands came dangerously close to large-scale outages and issued its highest level warning for the first time . in germany , several atomic energy facilities , including heiler brunsbüttel , isar i , and obrigheim , reduced output by up to 50 % because the rivers , from which they pull water to cool their facilities , were too warm . environmental conditions also hindered the production of energy from alternative sources : low water levels caused by the drought and calm winds meant energy generated from water and wind could not fill the gap . energy companies assure worried germans energy companies in europe and elsewhere turned to buying extra reserves from the european power exchange , otherwise known as the spot-market , based in leipzig , where peak hour prices doubled to twice their weekly average . yet all through the crisis , utility company executives stressed that - although they were operating at reduced capacity - there was no danger of falling short of the need .
following the crisis in new york , experts reiterated that a similar crisis in germany was highly unlikely . the chairman of the association for energy technology , prof. h. j. wagner said : " our energy-production facilities are secure .
as soon as one generator falls out , another springs into action ; if multiple facilities malfunction , our european neighbors provide us with energy . " prof. wagner went on to explain that the europeans benefit from a networked system , which allows them to draw upon other country 's facilities at times of crisis .
such a network does not exist in the united states . power shortages and higher prices ? but it was n't just fears of power outage that had consumers concerned .
talk that the cost of energy on the openly traded spot-market in leipzig was trading at such astronomical levels also worried consumers not wise to the ways of the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers need n't worry , john lane , an analyst who monitors the european energy market for datamonitor , a london-based consulting firm , told deutsche welle . " the price is not passed on to the consumer , because they pay a flat rate , " said lane .
" but the utility companies take the loss . " one would think that energy companies would , therefore , be motivated to diversify their facilities , by investing in renewable energy , and giving themselves the choice to switch from source to another , depending on environmental conditions .
not so , says lane , because the cost of investing in new facilities is so high .
" it 's more cost effective to take that kind of hit every now and then than to invest in new technology that is not so weather sensitive . " the latter point is up for debate , as the german government is discussing the path of the country 's energy industry .
the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the atomic facilities which proved so troublesome this past week are due to be phased out , but industry executives and those at the environmental ministry are at odds over how to fill the gap - through renewable energy or traditional fossil fuel - and provide reliable energy under all conditions , at the right price for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will power germany in the future ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .
defense lawyers believed binalshibh would be able to show how insignificant a role motassadeq had in the plans . in order to put the authorities under more pressure , mzoudi 's lawyers have said they will discourage their client from saying anything at the trial .
the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .
one must surely be resolved before the other can stand a chance . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de popkomm opens with pledge of governmental support the world 's largest music conference kicked off on thursday with the announcement of the establishment of a regulated internet exchange and a renewed commitment to the promotion of german music -lrb- aug .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .

large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems . technicians are struggling to get the lights back on in new york and elsewhere in north america after an unprecedented blackout on thursday , but europe - and germany - have had troubles of their own . the recent heat-wave in europe has taxed energy production facilities across the continent .
the netherlands came dangerously close to large-scale outages and issued its highest level warning for the first time . in germany , several atomic energy facilities , including heiler brunsbüttel , isar i , and obrigheim , reduced output by up to 50 % because the rivers , from which they pull water to cool their facilities , were too warm . environmental conditions also hindered the production of energy from alternative sources : low water levels caused by the drought and calm winds meant energy generated from water and wind could not fill the gap . energy companies assure worried germans energy companies in europe and elsewhere turned to buying extra reserves from the european power exchange , otherwise known as the spot-market , based in leipzig , where peak hour prices doubled to twice their weekly average . yet all through the crisis , utility company executives stressed that - although they were operating at reduced capacity - there was no danger of falling short of the need .
following the crisis in new york , experts reiterated that a similar crisis in germany was highly unlikely . the chairman of the association for energy technology , prof. h. j. wagner said : " our energy-production facilities are secure .
as soon as one generator falls out , another springs into action ; if multiple facilities malfunction , our european neighbors provide us with energy . " prof. wagner went on to explain that the europeans benefit from a networked system , which allows them to draw upon other country 's facilities at times of crisis .
such a network does not exist in the united states . power shortages and higher prices ? but it was n't just fears of power outage that had consumers concerned .
talk that the cost of energy on the openly traded spot-market in leipzig was trading at such astronomical levels also worried consumers not wise to the ways of the industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers need n't worry , john lane , an analyst who monitors the european energy market for datamonitor , a london-based consulting firm , told deutsche welle . " the price is not passed on to the consumer , because they pay a flat rate , " said lane .
" but the utility companies take the loss . " one would think that energy companies would , therefore , be motivated to diversify their facilities , by investing in renewable energy , and giving themselves the choice to switch from source to another , depending on environmental conditions .
not so , says lane , because the cost of investing in new facilities is so high .
" it 's more cost effective to take that kind of hit every now and then than to invest in new technology that is not so weather sensitive . " the latter point is up for debate , as the german government is discussing the path of the country 's energy industry .
the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the atomic facilities which proved so troublesome this past week are due to be phased out , but industry executives and those at the environmental ministry are at odds over how to fill the gap - through renewable energy or traditional fossil fuel - and provide reliable energy under all conditions , at the right price for consumers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what will power germany in the future ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .
the bdv says the german government 's view will not play a decisive role in the final decision of where the center will be housed .
it says it is independent and has already raised significant funds towards building a headquarters for the center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting history in the right place a hot debate has erupted between germany and poland over where to locate a documentation center for the millions of people expelled from poland at the end of world war ii -lrb- may 17 , 2002 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.08.2003 u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now welcomed by the international community - the interim governing council of iraq .
the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .

large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems . technicians are struggling to get the lights back on in new york and elsewhere in north america after an unprecedented blackout on thursday , but europe - and germany - have had troubles of their own . the recent heat-wave in europe has taxed energy production facilities across the continent .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .
the bdv says the german government 's view will not play a decisive role in the final decision of where the center will be housed .
it says it is independent and has already raised significant funds towards building a headquarters for the center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting history in the right place a hot debate has erupted between germany and poland over where to locate a documentation center for the millions of people expelled from poland at the end of world war ii -lrb- may 17 , 2002 -rrb- .

large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems . technicians are struggling to get the lights back on in new york and elsewhere in north america after an unprecedented blackout on thursday , but europe - and germany - have had troubles of their own . the recent heat-wave in europe has taxed energy production facilities across the continent .
the netherlands came dangerously close to large-scale outages and issued its highest level warning for the first time . in germany , several atomic energy facilities , including heiler brunsbüttel , isar i , and obrigheim , reduced output by up to 50 % because the rivers , from which they pull water to cool their facilities , were too warm . environmental conditions also hindered the production of energy from alternative sources : low water levels caused by the drought and calm winds meant energy generated from water and wind could not fill the gap . energy companies assure worried germans energy companies in europe and elsewhere turned to buying extra reserves from the european power exchange , otherwise known as the spot-market , based in leipzig , where peak hour prices doubled to twice their weekly average . yet all through the crisis , utility company executives stressed that - although they were operating at reduced capacity - there was no danger of falling short of the need .
following the crisis in new york , experts reiterated that a similar crisis in germany was highly unlikely . the chairman of the association for energy technology , prof. h. j. wagner said : " our energy-production facilities are secure .

such a network does not exist in the united states . power shortages and higher prices ? but it was n't just fears of power outage that had consumers concerned .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .
the bdv says the german government 's view will not play a decisive role in the final decision of where the center will be housed .
it says it is independent and has already raised significant funds towards building a headquarters for the center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting history in the right place a hot debate has erupted between germany and poland over where to locate a documentation center for the millions of people expelled from poland at the end of world war ii -lrb- may 17 , 2002 -rrb- .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .
defense lawyers believed binalshibh would be able to show how insignificant a role motassadeq had in the plans . in order to put the authorities under more pressure , mzoudi 's lawyers have said they will discourage their client from saying anything at the trial .
the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .

the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .
the two cases are similar , but defense lawyers are hoping for a different outcome . half a year after a hamburg judge sentenced moroccan mounir el-motassadeq to the maximum 15 years for aiding and abetting the september 11 terrorist attacks , the trial of one of his friends begins grappling with the same questions the previous trial left open . like motassadeq , abdelghani mzoudi loitered on the edges of the tight-knit cell of terrorists suspected of planning and carrying the terrorist attacks in washington and new york city .
like his countryman , mzoudi , 30 , faces charges of accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks and membership in a terror organization . as the trial gets underway , the judges will attempt to answer the same question that burdened the motassadeq trial : when do the favors done by friends of the cell become complicity in the attacks ? similar trials , different strategies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq german police hovered around mzoudi for more than a year after the terrorist attacks before finally bringing him in for question .
following the successful prosecution of motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , federal prosecutors formally arrested mzoudi and charged him with the same crimes for which motassadeq is currently serving 15 years . prosecutors say mzoudi 's role was similar to motassadeq 's . he paid the bills for zakariya essabar , who investigators believed was supposed to be one of the hijackers before he was denied a visa , and let atta and terror pilot marwan al-shehi give his address as their own while they were away in afghanistan .
reports say that prosecutors also intend to prove that mzoudi was in afghanistan and met up with one of the members of the hamburg cell in casablanca . defense lawyers will take much the same tack used by motassadeq 's team , namely , that the favors done by mzoudi are typical among muslims .
but if mzoudi is to avoid a simliar fate , the lawyers will undoubtedly need more . the missing link missing in the motassadeq case was the testimony of ramzi binalshibh -lrb- photo of his capture -rrb- , one of the plots ' masterminds who since september 11 , 2002 is being held at an undisclosed location by the u.s. government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. and german authorities refused to let binalshibh testify in the motassadeq case , and the court rejected appeals by the defense to force an answer from the german intelligence agency .
defense lawyers believed binalshibh would be able to show how insignificant a role motassadeq had in the plans . in order to put the authorities under more pressure , mzoudi 's lawyers have said they will discourage their client from saying anything at the trial .
the hope is that mzoudi will avoid mistakes such as the one motassadeq made on the first day of his trial when he admitted to attending a taliban training camp in afghanistan .
they also plan to file numerous requests with the court to get binalshibh and other witnesses to testify . not letting in the testimony , say observers , would serious damage the credibility of the trial verdict . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report castigates cia , fbi and germany for 9/11 failures u.s. congressional investigators say the cia and fbi overlooked important clues that could have helped them stop the sept .

as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary . the heads of germany 's top four energy companies met with chancellor gerhard schröder and his economics minister for dinner thursday evening to discuss how germany will be powered in the future . the poignancy of the meeting was increased by the huge power outage across much of north america , which has left millions without electricity from new york city to toronto . most experts think a similar blackout it unlikely in germany , but recent heat has heavily taxed energy supplies throughout europe . though schröder 's talks with the energy bosses were private , the participants already hinted at the direction they were thinking by excluding one prominent politician : environmental minister jürgen trittin . the green party minister has said again and again that germany 's future is in sun , wind and water power .
that runs against the plans of energy concerns like e.on , rwe , vatenfall europe and energie baden-württemberg who still deal in traditional energy like coal and nuclear power . observers are pointing to a showdown in a not-so-far-off future .
next year , germany begins a massive restructuring of its power resources .
according to a law successfully pushed through parliament by the green party , nuclear power reactors will begin to shut down .
trittin : sun , wind , water are the future trittin would like the traditional power resources gradually scaled down in favor of renewable resources .
a revamped bill proposal , dubbed the renewable energy law , has already been presented by the environmental ministry . in line with european union plans , it aims to double renewable energy 's piece of the overall german energy output to 12.5 percent by 2012 .
by 2020 , it should hold 20 percent of the market .
trittin attacked the company bosses for their hesitation on german television thursday ahead of the meeting . " there is not a lack of conditions , there is lack of acceptance , " trittin said . energy company bosses say renewable energy , though booming in recent years , is n't competitive enough to survive the market over the long-term .
opposition politicians from germany 's conservative and liberal parties have joined them in demanding the social democratic-green party coalition develop a more practical energy philosophy . protestors : ' chancellor , do something ! ' chancellor schröder is keeping quiet .
his office told reporters that the meeting was nothing more than a get-to-know-you session , as three of the four energy bosses are relatively new to their jobs . that has n't stopped environmental groups like greenpeace from giving them an earful .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .
carefully worded resolution thursday ’ s vote marks the second attempt by washington to get an iraq resolution adopted by the u.n. since the official end of fighting .
an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said he was " pleased to see that the new resolution calls for integrating the u.n. in the process of rebuilding the country . "
as to german military involvement in iraq , schröder said nothing was to be decided at the moment .
berlin is first interested in seeing that reconstruction takes place peacefully , he stressed .
the question of germany sending troops to iraq has been hotly debated in the last several days , with the minister for defense saying soldiers could be sent under a u.n. mandate .
schröder , however , has warned against " wild speculations " on possible troop deployments and insists nothing has changed regarding germany ’ s position on iraq .

an earlier resolution proposal foundered in july after debate flared over the language used in the original u.s. draft , which said u.n. members " endorse " the governing council of iraq .
but the security council members balked at giving too much legitimacy to the interim baghdad administration set up by the united states and britain and overseen by the senior civilian u.s. administrator in iraq , paul bremer .
the word " endorse " was therefore dropped from the text and replaced with " welcomes . "
the approved resolution still does not go as far as washington would like in formally recognizing the governing council as the representative of the iraqi people , but it is as negroponte said , a " clear signal to those who oppose the political transformation underway in iraq that they are out of step with world opinion .

the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested . the u.n. security council voted 14-0 on thursday to adopt resolution 1500 " welcoming " the creation of baghdad 's new interim governing council , formed and overseen by the united states and great britain .
syria , the council 's sole arab nation , chose to abstain from the vote arguing that only the iraqi people could decide what is best for them .
the u.s.-drafted measure co-sponsored by great britain authorizes an initial 12-month mandate for the new u.n. assistance mission for iraq -lrb- unami -rrb- , as secretary general kofi annan had urged .
the formal mandate allows unami to provide humanitarian assistance and political advice and to monitor the reconstruction efforts and progress towards the creation of a democratic government in iraq .
the resolution does not , however , call for a full-fledged mandate for the world body as countries like france and germany had requested .
france , which is a permanent member in the security council , and india had pressed for a resolution giving the u.n. greater responsibility in iraq , arguing that doing so would make it easier for other members to participate in peacekeeping missions and in the reconstruction of the war-torn country .
many member states , germany included , had resisted u.s. requests for military assistance in iraq unless the country came under a full u.n. mandate .
but the united states brushed aside the demands , saying the current resolution allowed for countries to help out in iraq .
broadly representative first step the resolution stops just short of recognizing the interim authority as iraq ’ s official government , as washington had originally requested .
instead it calls the creation of the 25-member iraqi governing council , which was set up by the united states and britain last month , " broadly representative . "
the council sees it as " an important first step towards the formation of a legitimate independent government in the country , " but stresses that it is only temporary .
the united states , nonetheless sees the resolution as a milestone to restoring peace in the country .
" in its expression of support for the governing council of iraq , this hastens the day when the people of iraq are in full command of their own affairs , a condition they have not known for some three decades , " u.s. ambassador to the u.n. john negroponte said following the vote .
germany , france and russia greeted the authorization of unami as an important step towards increasing the united nation ’ s role in iraq .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.08.2003 politics goes pop in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics and pop do n't make good music , especially when the industry 's future is at stake .
as the 15th popkomm music conference attempted to maintain the pace set by the euphoric opening address , politicians mingled with industry experts and artists to discuss ways to improve the music business . it was billed as the debate where pop ’ s future would be planned and initiatives to secure that future would be discussed .
seated side by side on the stage were the people with the ideas and the people with the links to power who could bring those ideas to fruition .
everything was set for the first day ’ s main discussion , pop agenda – paving the path for the future , to start the music industry ’ s healing process .
but what the discussion actually showed , more than the ways politics and pop could work together , was the conflict of interests between parties and the lack of cohesive targets between everyone involved .
much has been said about the current problems plaguing the music industry .
the business finds itself floundering in a culture where a depressed economy leaves potential customers with less money to spend .
consequently , this has led to the creation of structures where free access to the products customers want are available on the internet .
the result in both cases is decreasing revenue for the music industry .
the burning question the subject of bootlegging and internet piracy was the main focus for germany ’ s politicians .
both monika griefhahn from the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and stefan kampeter from the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- insisted that more should be done to reduce " intellectual and creative theft . "
however , this was the only common ground the two shared , and even that was denied by both sides .
" there should be a framework for punishing this electronic theft and this should be a mandate for the government , " said kampeter .
" if we fail to protect copyright , we fail to protect the economy , " he stated and passed the blame onto his political opponent : " the spd , from as far back as the 1960 ’ s , has said that creative products should remain in the public domain , that there should be more sharing . "
this is the reason the cdu is pushing for more protection for intellectual property in the fight against piracy , kampeter said .
monika griefhahn retorted : " i don ’ t know where that claim about the spd came from .
we also believe that copyright needs to be protected , but we should apply practical solutions . "
griefhahn referred to the recent copyright legislation agreed by the government and the new added tax of € 9.24 on every cd burner sold as solutions the spd were initiating .
" we also need to reorganise the market , " she added .
" the agreement to start the cross industry downloading portal -lrb- a music sharing device run by the record companies where material can be downloaded for a charge -rrb- is evidence that this is happening . "
education is key those representing the music industry , although agreeing that piracy is severely damaging sales , preferred to address wider issues , such as education and the promotion of the creative economy .
udo dahmen , the head of the pop academy school in mannheim , believed that quality and training would be the savior of the music industry .
" people ask me , ‘ how can you teach pop music ? ’
i say we teach the basics of what kids should expect and nurture the talent they already have .
also , we teach them to appreciate quality music .
how can you expect quality music to be produced in the future if you don ’ t educate the kids in it ? "
dahmen added that his own vision for securing pop ’ s future would include teacher training and an increased use of music teaching in schools .
radio quota raises questions gerd gebahrt from the german phonographic association picked up on the quality issue to turn the discussion towards promotion .
he cited the proposed radio quota as a way of bringing german talent to a wider audience .
" only 10 percent of german music produced actually gets airtime .
we have a responsibility to give our artists airtime , " gebhardt said .
" the industry has seen a 30 percent market loss in the last five years , 16 percent of that in the last six months .
okay , it ’ s mostly down because of the ‘ free lunch ’ mentality of bootlegging , but if that ’ s the only way of getting hold of material , that ’ s what consumers will do to get it . "
he said radio access for german artists would revive a stagnant sector of the market .
stefan kampeter seized on the subject to cast doubts on what the quota would actually mean .
" in principle , the cdu agrees with the radio quota proposal .
it ’ s a good idea that the quality and quantity of german products are highlighted and get exposure , but guaranteeing 50 percent of german productions on the radio is going to be problematic .
as soon as you guarantee radio access , you ’ re talking about subsidizing pop music . "
gebhardt summed up the apparent disparity between pop and politics .
" i disagree .
they should play more german music and that ’ s that .
full stop . "
few solutions , more problems .
the task at hand may not be just the saving of pop ’ s future but the saving of the relationship between politics and the music industry .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- .

plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government . the campaign to build a controversial " center of expulsion " in berlin suffered a severe blow this week , after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he did not intend to grant it a home in germany . the association of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- had been pressing the german government for a building in berlin to house the center , intended to provide a focal point for the expulsions which took place across europe in the 20th century .
but schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the certer , he said , should be " europeanized . " " i am asking the association of german expellees to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place , " schröder explained to reporters on thursday .
he said by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . challenging traditional thinking but the head of the bdv , erica steinbach , argued that the german capital is the perfect home for the center , where she wants to see the establishment of a permanent exhibition on the fate of german expellees . the association 's vice president , peter glotz , added it was now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . although , their forced exit from the sudeten lands in the current-day czech republic , for example , clearly had its roots in the atrocities commited by germany under adolf hitler , glotz , a social democrat parliamentarian , said it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . prominent critics advise european-focus but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günther grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse .
along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . it is a view that schröder agrees with : " i think if you made it a more european issue and had a discussion about the issue of expulsion generally ... the suffering it causes and how we can prevent such things happening again in europe , that would be more suitable , " he said on wednesday . the president of the czech senate , petr pithartt has also suggested the center could be built in the czech republic .
this is a move that follows plans by the government there to set aside € 1.5 million in compensation to the 3,000 ethnic germans expelled from the sudeten lands after the collapse of the nazi regime . czech prime minister vldimir spidla told german news agency dpa : " for me there is no question . i do not believe that it is a good choice -lrb- to house the center in berlin -rrb- . "
deputy state premier in prague , petr mares , added : " it was a chapter in a string of tragic events , that -lrb- deeply -rrb- affected -lrb- the whole of -rrb- central europe . " but whether schröder will succeed in keeping expulsion off the german agenda remains to be seen .
the bdv says the german government 's view will not play a decisive role in the final decision of where the center will be housed .
it says it is independent and has already raised significant funds towards building a headquarters for the center . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting history in the right place a hot debate has erupted between germany and poland over where to locate a documentation center for the millions of people expelled from poland at the end of world war ii -lrb- may 17 , 2002 -rrb- .

the new vessel was officially commissioned by the scottish executive in a ceremony at leith on friday .
green msp robin harper said the minna , which has a maximum speed of 14 knots , was slower than the vessel it replaces and that most boats in the north sea would be able to outrun it .
but his allegation was denied by the executive , which said the new vessel would concentrate on inshore waters , where it would be faster than the boats it would encounter .

" they might just as well enter a mini into a formula one grand prix .
" how can the executive pretend to be taking fisheries protection seriously if it commissions the equivalent of a well-equipped motorised barge to chase the much faster boats in the north sea ?
" most of these boats are less than three years old and a high proportion are likely to have engines that have been illegally upgraded to give them a greater speed advantage . "

" the other three vessels in the fleet have a maximum speed of 18 knots , which equals the speed of the larger offshore fishing boats . "
she also claimed that modern fishery protection was not about high speed chases and that the greens should be glad that the new minna would burn much less fuel than a high speed boat .
at the ceremony , environment minister ross finnie said : " commissioning the third fpv minna brings the fleet back up to four vessels and allows fpv westra to go into well-deserved retirement after 28 years service .
" built on the clyde by a skilled and well-managed workforce , i anticipate the minna will have a long and trouble-free life ot service to the monitoring and enforcement task . "

in memo to staff , qantas said it intended to split into three units , in order to allow management to focus more tightly on strategy and cost-control .

3 of 13 jonsson became front and back page news when it emerged she had had an affair with england coach sven goran eriksson , who had a long-term girlfriend dell 'olio .
4 of 13 soon after , jonsson 's autobiography created a media frenzy as it contained allegations that she was raped early in her career by an unnamed celebrity .
5 of 13 jonsson 's life in the spotlight began in the early 1980s with the breakfast news show tv-am , where she became a household name as the weather girl .
6 of 13 jonsson became a popular fixture on uk tv , and in the celebrity press , and was soon presenting entertainment shows of her own .
7 of 13 as host of itv 's hit gladiators series , jonsson began dating hunter , one of the show 's athletes , after splitting from her cameraman husband john turnbull .
8 of 13 further hit tv shows followed , most notably bbc two 's offbeat game show shooting stars , where jonsson was a regular panellist .
9 of 13 in the late 1990s , jonsson 's love life hit the headlines when she began a tempestuous relationship with aston villa and england footballer stan collymore .
10 of 13 jonsson ended the relationship after collymore attacked her in a paris bar in 1998 .
11 of 13 jonsson 's next long-term relationship to advertising executive markus kempen was much more low-key and kept out of the limelight .
12 of 13 in her career , jonsson has continued to host and feature on a variety of entertainment shows including taking part in celebrity fame academy for comic relief in 2003 .
13 of 13 jonsson can thank a tv show for finding her mr right and she is said to have chosen to take gerrard-wright 's name .

the power failures caused chaos as they spread from new york to detroit , and toronto to ottawa .
traffic lights failed , underground railways were evacuated and people were trapped in lifts in offices and apartments .
canadian officials said a fire at a power plant near the upstate new york town of niagara caused the outage , but us officials disputed that theory , although they said terrorism was not to blame .
it 's frightening because the news is eerily reminiscent of 9/11 matt , new york power cuts : were you affected ?
power is slowly returning to the affected areas - thought to encompass more than 50 million people - but full restoration will take much longer , officials say .
federal energy regulatory commission spokesman bryan lee said the outage destabilised the power grid , cascading up and taking " a loop around the great lakes into canada " .
but us officials were looking at a power transmission problem from canada as the most likely cause of the biggest outage in us history , said a spokeswoman for new york governor george pataki .
in other developments : there have been reports of sporadic looting in at least four areas of the canadian capital , ottawa .
president george w bush said the outages were not a terrorist act and added : " we 're slowly but surely coping with this massive national problem . "
nine nuclear reactors in four us states were taken offline , the nuclear regulator said .
the us federal aviation administration halted flights into six airports - three in the new york area , one in cleveland , and two in canada - for several hours .
in new york city , subways , lifts and airports , including john f kennedy and laguardia airports , lost electricity or resorted to limited backup power .
the blackout closed the detroit-windsor tunnel , which 27,000 vehicles use daily .
' no injuries ' the bbc 's john terrett in new york says the city is waking up to an unusual sight - thousands of people lying on the sidewalks , propped up against shop fronts , lounging on the edge of fountains , huddled round small clusters of night lights chatting .
recent us blackouts 1996:4m people hit by electricity outage across nine states 1977 : lightning strike leaves new york without power for 25 hours 1965 : power loss in north-east us and southern canada hits 30m people he says the authorities promised to restore power for rush hour but while electricity is returning slowly to the suburbs , the island of manhattan remains in the dark .
as dusk faded into night , new york 's famed skyline was shrouded in darkness and residents turned to candles and torches for light .
many workers left their offices early , walking across bridges out of manhattan , choking pavements and roads .
civilians manned intersections directing gridlocked traffic after traffic signals failed , while on the pavements dozens of people queued up to use payphones after mobile phone networks broke down .
new york mayor michael bloomberg said power was starting to come back from the north and from the west but would take hours not minutes .
he told new yorkers to treat friday " as a snow day .
it would n't be the worst thing to take a day off , " he said .
in an effort to calm frayed nerves , he cautioned new yorkers to stay cool and drink fluids .
new york emergency services had no reports of anyone injured during evacuations from tall buildings or underground subways .
power to many hospitals and prisons was also reported to have failed but key institutions were working on back-up generators .
searing heat the bbc 's lee carter , in toronto , says the lights went back on in the centre of the city just after 2300 local time -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- .
the city 's landmark , cn tower , was once again illuminated , but power is returning very slowly to the city , with most areas still reportedly in darkness .

transcript manisha tank : hello and welcome to the bbc six forum , i 'm manisha tank .
babies left with relatives become slower learners at school than those who receive paid childcare .
so say researchers from bristol university who 've been looking into the effects of mothers going back into full-time work .
but childcare spaces are scarce and many parents find they ca n't afford nurseries .
so what are your options and how does going back to work affect your kids .
here to answer your questions is lisa harker , chair of the trustees at the daycare trust who joins us from our oxford studio .
good to see you lisa .
we 've had lots of questions about the subject , many of them ranging from - why not leave kids with the relatives , what are the costs of childcare , do employers do enough .
but we 'll begin with a question from gillian mcshane , dartmouth : i leave my daughters -lrb- aged 5 and 3 -rrb- with their grandmother because i know i can trust her .
i could n't leave my girls with someone i did n't know , but this report has got me worried .
lisa harker : well parents really should n't be too worried .
most parents do rely on what we call informal childcare - that 's childcare with a relative like a grandparent or perhaps with a friend .
in fact grandmothers are the most commonly used form of childcare , if i could put it like that .
an important thing is that study shows that formal childcare - paid for childcare with trained professionals - is a better quality .
now that should n't be a surprise to us , that 's about investing in a very high standard of care that we expect for children .
in fact , the study shows , that if you combined good quality care with some care by a friend or a relative , then that was the very best option of all for children .
so this is n't saying to parents , abandon your current arrangements .
but it is saying that as a country we ought to be investing in the kinds of good quality childcare that produced the best outcomes for children .
manisha tank : rebecca d , maidenhead : most mums i know would love to stay home and look after their children , but ca n't afford this option .
childcare costs invariably mean you do rely on relatives .
surely this provides a good home from home environment ?
lisa harker : well that 's absolutely true that most people feel they do n't have a choice whatsoever and that 's the most important thing i think for all parents to be able to choose the best option for them and their children .
about two-thirds of mothers return to work within the first year and that 's very unusual by european standards .
most other countries have a long period of paid parental leave where people can step out of the labour market for a while and look after their kids .
so choice is absolutely crucial .
the cost of childcare is very prohibitive and in this country you 're looking at typical costs of about £ 128 a week for a nursery place and about £ 118 a week for a childminding place and that adds up to more than £ 6,500 a year - that 's a huge sum of money for people to be able to afford .
and even though there is some help with childcare costs through the childcare tax credit , only a small proportion of families are currently claiming that credit .
so yes , at the moment their simply is n't the choice that parents ought to have for their children .
manisha tank : vedinee pattar , pimlico , london : why is uk more expensive than the other european countries in terms of childcare ?
lisa harker : well there 's a very simple answer to that - we have n't , in this country , invested in childcare through public funding in the same way that other countries have done and we 've got a lot to catch up .
i 've just been to visit denmark , for example , where they 've had for 30 years a guarantee of a childcare place for every child and parents there pay no more than 30 % of the cost of a place , whereas here parents are paying more like 75 % of the cost of a place on average .
so we have a lot of catching up to do and the only way to do that would be to invest in childcare in the same way that we do with education and health through a tax system .
manisha tank : let 's go into a little more detail on this issue of cost .
we 've received an e-mail from ruben c and n b smales daycare in nottingham who ask : how can childcare providers be expected to offer low-price , high standards of care when staffing costs are high and there 's no money to help new nurseries sustain their growth potential ?
lisa harker : the cost of running a nursery is very expensive , particularly the start-up costs where you 're trying to set the building and the provision inside the building .
then of course staffing costs are your main costs .
in fact we do n't pay childcare workers very much in this country and so although the costs are huge by proportion - in fact we ought to be paying more if anything .
the question then lies on who should pay the cost of childcare - if parents ca n't more we certainly wo n't expect providers to be cutting back their costs in any way .
the only other answer really is to bear the costs more evenly through the population through paying perhaps through our tax system for more investment in childcare across the board .
manisha tank : david , crawley : could more be done to encourage employers to provide creche / nursery facilities ?
how does britain 's employers fare when it comes childcare ?
lisa harker : there is a very low level of employer-provided childcare in the country .
a lot of other european have very low levels as well but that 's partly because there 's a lot of publicly funded places and employers do n't to provide extra places .
there is much more that employers can do .
in fact the government has been looking at this and it has currently got some consultation of proposals underway to look at how they can provide some tax incentives for employers to perhaps more generously invest in childcare for their employees .
certainly by clubbing together by employers in their locality joining together and looking for ways of investing in local nurseries , for example , employers can do an awful lot .
manisha tank : meanwhile the government , you mentioned before , could do a bit more .
mark , hammersmith says : the government says there is only one childcare place for every five children under the age of eight .
what is being done to rectify this ?
lisa harker : the government have got a national childcare strategy underway and indeed for the last five years we 've had more investment than we 've ever seen in childcare in this country .
as i 've said before , we have a long , long way to catch up .
so part of this is about sustained and increased investment over time .
i hope that the government will perhaps take the opportunity in the run up to the next election to really put this on a priority list for them .
i think that this is what parents are asking for - more investment in services to give them genuine choice as to whether they return to work and when they return to work .
it 's about political priorities ultimately .
i hope that that 's likely to happen in the coming years .
manisha tank : deborah , london has sent a text message in : how young should a child be to start nursery and what childcare is best for a 7 month-old ?
lisa harker : well there 's no cut and fast rule , i 'm afraid .
a lot of it has to rest with the parents ' judgement about what 's best for their child .
there are plenty of guides that parents can look to , to discuss with different childcare providers about the type of childcare that they provide and for them to think about whether it 's good enough quality and whether it will suit their particular circumstances .
so you should contact your local childcare information centre .
you should look to organisations like daycare trust - we produce many guides for parents - and really to talk to people , talk to childminders , talk to your local nursery , talk to your friends about the kinds of options about the kinds of options available to you and really think about what you feel will suit you and your child best .
i 'm afraid there 's no one-size fits all - children are very different .
the most important thing is that you really think about the quality of the service that 's available .
manisha tank : susan , bristol asks : justine , my 7 month-old seems to enjoy childcare and i would say that he is flourishing .
but signs should i look out for which might indicate that there were problems ?
lisa harker : it sounds like this parent is doing absolutely the right thing to look out for whether this child is flourishing .
you can tell if a child is perhaps very quiet and subdued and coming back not wanting to go back into the childcare facility .
go and have a look at the facility .
see what the children do during the day .
ask the staff about the way they organise activities , whether they can report back at the end of the day about what your child has been up to .
think about how much they spend time sitting reading , doing play activities .
just watch your child to see whether they are happy in that environment because a very good quality childcare which is a very stimulating and free environment to learn is a very , very good place for a child to be .
manisha tank : jay stuart e-mails from northern ireland : do you think that society pressurises women to return to work soon after childbirth by portraying housewives as second-class to those who are earning ?
lisa harker : well i do think we 've had a very unfortunate debate in this country where we seem to have polarised the options for parents - you are either a stay-at-home mum , in which your case you are devalued in society .
or you are a return to work mum , in which case you seem to be ignoring the best interests of your child .
now neither of those things are true - for many parents it 's about combining both of those things - working part-time or perhaps taking some leave arrangements for a period of time .
i think if we move to the sort of situation where mums and dads can have much more flexible working arrangements and there 's the opportunity to use good quality childcare , then it 's best for parents and it 's certainly is best for children .
manisha tank : excellent advice there for us all .
lisa harker of the daycare trust , thanks very much for joining us .
that 's it for now for this six forum .
we did have hundreds of e-mails and i 'm only sorry that we could n't get through them all .
but i do hope that you 'll join us again next time .
goodbye .

the question then lies on who should pay the cost of childcare - if parents ca n't more we certainly wo n't expect providers to be cutting back their costs in any way .
the only other answer really is to bear the costs more evenly through the population through paying perhaps through our tax system for more investment in childcare across the board .
manisha tank : david , crawley : could more be done to encourage employers to provide creche / nursery facilities ?
how does britain 's employers fare when it comes childcare ?
lisa harker : there is a very low level of employer-provided childcare in the country .
a lot of other european have very low levels as well but that 's partly because there 's a lot of publicly funded places and employers do n't to provide extra places .
there is much more that employers can do .
in fact the government has been looking at this and it has currently got some consultation of proposals underway to look at how they can provide some tax incentives for employers to perhaps more generously invest in childcare for their employees .
certainly by clubbing together by employers in their locality joining together and looking for ways of investing in local nurseries , for example , employers can do an awful lot .
manisha tank : meanwhile the government , you mentioned before , could do a bit more .
mark , hammersmith says : the government says there is only one childcare place for every five children under the age of eight .
what is being done to rectify this ?
lisa harker : the government have got a national childcare strategy underway and indeed for the last five years we 've had more investment than we 've ever seen in childcare in this country .
as i 've said before , we have a long , long way to catch up .
so part of this is about sustained and increased investment over time .
i hope that the government will perhaps take the opportunity in the run up to the next election to really put this on a priority list for them .
i think that this is what parents are asking for - more investment in services to give them genuine choice as to whether they return to work and when they return to work .
it 's about political priorities ultimately .
i hope that that 's likely to happen in the coming years .
manisha tank : deborah , london has sent a text message in : how young should a child be to start nursery and what childcare is best for a 7 month-old ?
lisa harker : well there 's no cut and fast rule , i 'm afraid .
a lot of it has to rest with the parents ' judgement about what 's best for their child .
there are plenty of guides that parents can look to , to discuss with different childcare providers about the type of childcare that they provide and for them to think about whether it 's good enough quality and whether it will suit their particular circumstances .
so you should contact your local childcare information centre .
you should look to organisations like daycare trust - we produce many guides for parents - and really to talk to people , talk to childminders , talk to your local nursery , talk to your friends about the kinds of options about the kinds of options available to you and really think about what you feel will suit you and your child best .
i 'm afraid there 's no one-size fits all - children are very different .
the most important thing is that you really think about the quality of the service that 's available .
manisha tank : susan , bristol asks : justine , my 7 month-old seems to enjoy childcare and i would say that he is flourishing .
but signs should i look out for which might indicate that there were problems ?
lisa harker : it sounds like this parent is doing absolutely the right thing to look out for whether this child is flourishing .
you can tell if a child is perhaps very quiet and subdued and coming back not wanting to go back into the childcare facility .
go and have a look at the facility .
see what the children do during the day .
ask the staff about the way they organise activities , whether they can report back at the end of the day about what your child has been up to .
think about how much they spend time sitting reading , doing play activities .
just watch your child to see whether they are happy in that environment because a very good quality childcare which is a very stimulating and free environment to learn is a very , very good place for a child to be .
manisha tank : jay stuart e-mails from northern ireland : do you think that society pressurises women to return to work soon after childbirth by portraying housewives as second-class to those who are earning ?
lisa harker : well i do think we 've had a very unfortunate debate in this country where we seem to have polarised the options for parents - you are either a stay-at-home mum , in which your case you are devalued in society .
or you are a return to work mum , in which case you seem to be ignoring the best interests of your child .
now neither of those things are true - for many parents it 's about combining both of those things - working part-time or perhaps taking some leave arrangements for a period of time .
i think if we move to the sort of situation where mums and dads can have much more flexible working arrangements and there 's the opportunity to use good quality childcare , then it 's best for parents and it 's certainly is best for children .
manisha tank : excellent advice there for us all .
lisa harker of the daycare trust , thanks very much for joining us .
that 's it for now for this six forum .
we did have hundreds of e-mails and i 'm only sorry that we could n't get through them all .
but i do hope that you 'll join us again next time .
goodbye .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- should the nhs pay for ivf ?
home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 15 august , 2003 , 09:07 gmt 10:07 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version should the nhs pay for ivf ?
fertility treatment could soon be far more widely available on the nhs .
infertile women under 40 could be offered up to six cycles of ivf at a potential cost of £ 15,000 a patient .
the national institute of clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- said it was an attempt to set national standards for fertility treatment to end the existing " postcode lottery " for women .
one in six couples have fertility problems and there are there are 27,000 ivf attempts in britain every year .
should ivf treatment be paid for by the nhs ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received : the nhs already provides free advice by doctors on lifestyle changes to increase fertility , free fertility checks to establish the problem , and an immediate free support system whether or not any ivf is successful .
people saying " i have paid my taxes and taken nothing out ... " ... have you been to your doctor about the infertility ?
was it free ?
who paid for it . the nhs .
no one would claim your right to seek advice from the doctor is unjust or unwarranted , nor would suggest that you had to go private on the successful birth because it was your lifestyle choice to have a child .
when you consider that level of support available and being utilised already , the government asking you to contribute ? 3,000 per cycle would n't seem unreasonable .
kevin , uk a little empathy would not go a miss here .
i am lucky to have a child naturally but after miscarriage .
if you have never lost a child or longed for one you can not know what it is like to feel the pain that infertility brings .
the nhs is mainly stretched by over paid management and incompetence rather than ' greedy ' people sucking it dry .
what about those people whose infertility is as a result of illness such as cancer ?
or do we go down the road of ' deserving and undeserving ' people -lrb- as many do with hiv -rrb- .
infertility is not the result of ' selfish ' women who sleep around and pursue their careers and then demand a child ! -lrb- blame the women again hmmmm -rrb- .
have a heart - managed properly the money would be there .
kes uk , uk for too long , everyone pussyfoots round childless couples who want kids as if discussing children or families is some great no-no .
this perpetuates this obsessive " i 'm a victim " mentality that they always seem to have , and all the time they 're obsessed with having a child , they 're lives are passing them by .
not being able to have a child is unfortunate , but pales into insignificance when compared to most other social and medical conditions that ruin people 's daily lives .
i think far too much of this is people who 've nothing better to do with their lives becoming focused on one goal , because it 's the only one they 've got .
get over it and get a life .
katherine walker , uk surely couples who conceive naturally are also selfish for wanting a child when they could adopt elaine , england as someone who has recently gone through ivf i have found a lot of the comments very cruel and hurtful .
why is it that only the couples who undergo ivf treatment are considered selfish for desiring a child - surely couples who conceive naturally are also selfish for wanting a child and could just have easily chosen to adopt instead .
elaine , england if you ca n't afford ivf maybe you should consider fully if you can afford a child .
amanda , england yes ivf should be funded but limited to at least three cycles .
six cycles would be too emotionally draining for a couple .
nina , uk yes ivf should be made available to all who need it .
i feel particularly strongly about this as i had a child last year naturally who i watched die 8 days later from an infection while in hospital .
to cut a very long story short i was told i would be able to have another child .
later i discovered that due to retained placenta after delivery i had also caught an infection .
i went into an nhs hospital with my fertility and a child and left with neither .
our only chance now for a family is ivf .
no one wants to help us and our desire to have a family is far stronger than it ever was before .
there is no right to have a child. it is an uncontrollable biological desire some of us are privileged to experience .
i have no control over the grief and depression i feel at the loss of our daughter and similarly i have no control over my desire to be a mother .
there is no price that can be put on this - it affects all areas of life .
just like the loss of a child - you only understand it if you experience it .
diane , england i myself , at only 21 , am going through infertility treatment .
we have been trying for over 2 years .
there is no way which we could afford to pay for ivf even though my partner earns a decent salary as a huge amount is taken off in taxes to pay for the nhs , schools etc .
i find it offensive that people who drink themselves into liver failure get treatment without question , yet those who have a problem which is not their fault , get told they must either wait 1-4 years to have the treatment or pay an extortionate amount of money .
children are my life , not only do i work as a nursery nurse but i have also taken on my fiance 's two children who live with us full time .
i would love to see ivf be paid for fully by the nhs - infertility causes so much heartache to so many people .
laurie slater , scotland i appreciate the heartache .
i do n't appreciate the maths .
i do n't appreciate the supreme demanding arrogance of people i am reading here .
i do n't appreciate " i want i want and at 24 i ca n't wait a year and a half for it because i want it now ! " attitude .
be grateful that there exists this technology , do n't be such scrooges that you ca n't be bothered to pay for it yourself but expect everyone else to .

automatically sacking police officers found to have behaved in a racist way is too sweeping and cases should be judged individually instead , says the police complaints authority -lrb- pca -rrb- .
going against recommendations from the macpherson report into the murder of black teenager stephen lawrence , the pca says " we do n't agree with the blanket approach - it 's too ' one size fits all ... there are occasions when incidents are n't that clear cut . "
racism is a serious breach of conduct and diluting the lawrence recommendation like this is not acceptable , says the national assembly against racism .
is the approach too ' one size fits all ' ?
do the police need to come down harder on racism in the force ?
is watering down the guidelines allowing racism to flourish ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : in scotland most car thieves are generalised as little white males with baseball caps , shell suits , cropped hair and nasal accents .
does this mean that the police should be arresting more black or pakistani people ?
no - because these are not the guys perpetrating the crimes , the shellsuited neds are !
i am a bit concerned that ' racism ' seems to only cover discrimination against people of a different colour .
i do n't agree with one size fits all as at one end of the spectrum we have stephen lawrence and at the other we have day to day ' banter ' .
how many scots and english born people face witty banter from their police colleagues when they are working in each other 's countries ?
brian , scotland many people treat the mcpherson report as if it were the bible .
in reality , it is just as subject to flaws as any other document .
it is therefore absolutely necessary in this case for the police to review the recommendations , rather than slavishly following them .
to do otherwise would allow lord macpherson to effectively dictate police policy .
brendan fernandes , uk it 's the continuous playing of the race-card that breeds resentment bob , uk our police are n't racist .
they are scared to arrest anyone who is black , because the race card has been played so many times .
now they want us to sack a police officer if he arrests a black person for a crime ?
stupid .
if black and asian people want equality they have to realise that they are capable of sickening crimes just like everyone else .
it 's the continuous playing of the race-card that breeds resentment .
bob , uk how can treating each case individually deal with the institutional racism which is still as widespread as it ever was ?
it does n't stop at racism either - anyone who does n't fit the " white middle-class 2.4 children and a volvo in the garage " template will almost certainly be victimised by the police for the way they look sooner or later .
david howe , uk i am a black man .
i have never been arrested and have never had a point on my driving license or never even received a parking ticket .
i am still stopped by the police while driving my car -lrb- currently a six month old sports car -rrb- about once a month .
i must admit i find it highly irritating .
while the police officers involved are always polite , as i am to them , not one has ever been able to give a sensible reason for why i am so frequently stopped .
my white male friends with similar cars and records have never been stopped .
why ?
i am afraid that racism is built into the british psyche .
there is no getting away from it .
i will continue to be polite but when i finally lose my temper - do not accuse me of being yet another difficult black man !
mark cooper , england having lived in the uk until i was 25 and moving to the usa i have had the experience of both police forces .
i myself am a white man who had a fairly privileged upbringing .
racism is sickening and must be combated but in today 's world many have forgotten what racism is .
it is to treat everyone fairly and therefore i somewhat welcome the advice by the pca .
why ? there is no doubt that racism is present in the force .
however it is important that special privileges are not given to those minorities if we are to truly combat racism and treat all equally .
america seemed to take a far more relaxed few which i think works in the cities .
dan killson , usa institutional racism has already led to the police failing to catch the guilty on a number of occasions gez smith , bristol , uk anyone who thinks that the police should be left to fight crime without interference or scrutiny obviously does n't believe in democracy .
we pay vast amounts of tax for the police , and have the right to expect an effective service from them in return .
institutional racism has already led to the police failing to catch the guilty on a number of occasions , and on those grounds at least the police must be held accountable .
gez smith , bristol , uk my stepfather is a retired police officer .
for his last 11 years service he was a dog-handler .
during that last 11 years the only arrests he ever made / was involved in were afro-caribbean males .
this is an amazing fact of life , and could not be dismissed as racism .
neither he nor i am racist .
am i racist for writing this letter , or is my step-father racist for doing his job ?
andrew , uk if anyone needs statistics then it is documented that 63 % of mugging victims reported to the metropolitan police that their attackers were black .
the statistics say ' most muggers are black ' , not ' most blacks are muggers ' can you see the difference ?
the reverend jesse jackson has been quoted as saying he was ashamed that if he heard footsteps behind him in the street he was relieved if he looked round and saw a white face .
i ca n't remember the last time i saw a burning cross , nor a ' whites only ' sign on a bus but i can remember the last time i saw the race card played by someone who thought they were martin luther king .
it makes me sick to see some off-colour language compared to the dreadful racism of ' 50s and ' 60s america .
let the police deal with the problem and let the responsible members of the black community help them .
reid , uk do you really believe that criminality is genetic ?
ben drake , york , uk i 'm alarmed at claims that people from ethnic minorities are more likely to commit crime .
do you really believe that criminality is genetic ?
it 's anti-scientific racist nonsense dragged up from the 19th century .
it 's true that black people are more likely to be arrested and charged , but that 's the point ; that 's the racism in the system .
ben drake , york , uk ben drake , no one is saying it 's genetic , more cultural .
as proved by sir paul condon several years ago , the majority of street crime is perpetrated by young black men .
who seems to continually graffiti trains and public places ?
young black men .
the police target young black men in the street mainly because statistically , it is young black men that cause street crime ed , uk to ben drake , statistics show that most street crime is committed by young black males .
most paedophiles are middle aged white men .
most rapes are by white and asian men .
most joy riders are young white men .
in fact , most crime is by men .
maybe we should look at that first !
helen , uk i have found our police officers always to be polite , considerate and helpful wahid anwar , uk i have been stopped by police a few times , just out of their duty to the public .
i have found our police officers always to be polite , considerate and helpful .
i think if i had the wrong attitude from the moment they stopped me , it would be a different matter .
as with anybody in life , if you are nice , they are nice .
too often , black people think that the only reason they are being stopped is because the police officers are racist .
they are just doing their job of protecting us .
wahid anwar , uk i was disgusted with some of the comments made by people when i lived in london - including one policeman who lived near me .
the nice police officer , who had never gone to australia or met an aboriginal person , told me that the only reason my country had any crime was because of our " darkies " .
when i pointed out to him that all of our mass murderers have been white he politely informed me that i did n't know what i was talking about .
i 'd suggest that either at least some of your police are racist , or you need a complete overhaul of how you teach the history of the british empire .
chris , australia the idea that certain ethnic groups have a predisposition to crime is complete and utter rubbish .
the statistics bandied about in both the us & uk that is supposed to support this ' fact ' is fundamentally flawed .
if a police force targets an ethnic group , then sure , they will find criminal activity within that group .
however , targeted policing by its very nature excludes other ethnic groups .
so if the police target blacks , they stop 30 black men and find 2 carrying drugs and so starts the statistical nonsense , because they have just ignored 30 white men , some of which would undoubtedly have also been in possession of drugs .
cameron , uk as a black person , i have never had an encounter with the police before in my life -lrb- do n't want to either -rrb- ... but to suggest that a police officer is dismissed for racism , i find that preposterous .
he should be ' asked ' to be more careful next time around .
chux , leeds i am a primary school teacher and racism is either on the increase , or people feel it 's acceptable .
it 's not acceptable and we must educate children , more or less from birth , not only to tolerate each other but also to be grateful and to feel honoured that we live in a multicultural , multifaith country .
marios solomonides , england how many people moaning about racism here , also moan about the police being too slow to deal with call-outs ?
it is this very kind of accusation that adds more and more time to the work of a police officer , and less of his time to fighting crime .
andy m , uk we need to be tougher on law and have harsher sentences for the out of control violence and anarchy on british streets , rather than concentrating on the usage of english language by our world-class police force .
john , england it is n't just racism it 's the stereotyping of the public that goes on within the police-force .
a friend of mine was recently arrested for breaking up a fight -lrb- the charges were later dropped following cctv footage -rrb- all because he is a fairly large lad with no hair ! !
i think racism is treated as the worst but it is just as bad as any other approach that means someone is arrested because of their appearance whether they are black , white , male or female .
helen , uk without doubt policeman must remain impartial at all times dom , uk without doubt policeman must remain impartial at all times .
it is not only right that they should be sacked , but i think they should be on a register that stops them getting other jobs where their racist attitudes affect other people .
dom , uk one thing the british public should be aware of is that racism is a growing trend in the uk .
i experience problems unlike that i ever experienced when i lived in california , before moving to england .
i now live in germany , and , so far , i have not experienced anything like what i had in the 10 years i lived england .
first thing you people need to do is acknowledge you have a racism problem , then you can start talking about tackling this problem .
eventually the police will follow .
hopefully .
miguel nieto , germany i am amazed .
crime rates are going up -lrb- out of control -rrb- , detection rates by the police are going down , and once again it seems some people think sacking policemen for racism should be a top priority !
i would rather the police had to go on courses on how to catch criminals .
racism is important , but let 's put criminals behind bars first .
l kelly , france you ca n't blame the entire police department for being racist .
but there are some who are .
sometimes a single incident can cause people to lose their confidence and trust from the entire police force .
every individual police officer should keep that in mind .
and on the other side , people coming from the east are not very law abiding people .
i know that .
i am from the east .
some hard handedness -lrb- a little , not much -rrb- is imperative .
even in a multicultural society people can and do live in different ages of social evolution .
police do need a special education to deal with their problems .
agha ata , usa it makes me sick that in targeting crime there is a fact that racial minorities create more crime on the whole that the majority .
this is a percentage .
and if the police try to target these minorities they are accused of being racists .
what about these groups of minorities that stick together and cause crime , are they not racist ?
but it also angers me that if a minority group are racist against the majority it is not a racist attack or statement .
the minorities are racist for not trying to mingle with the majority and making themselves more noticed as a minority .
that is what i have to say on the matter .
let the police combat crime by using facts , not politically correct opinions .
nina , uk no one has crime programmed into his or her genes tj , uk -lrb- nigerian -rrb- i do n't know where people get the ' statistics ' that people of ethnic minorities commit more crime .
i live in the north east of england , which is a white dominated majority , and there is a lot of drug crime committed by mostly white people .
people need to break the stereotypical views that certain people commit more crime , or else this will lead to the ugly situation in the us where racial profiling is -lrb- an encouraged -rrb- fact of life .
the socio-economic reasons for crime should be looked into , not racial or social origin because no one has crime programmed into his or her genes .
and yes , i believe that each police officer should be reviewed separately when it comes to dealing with issues of racism because this is a very emotive and shady issue that ca n't be resolved using a blanket approach .
after all , is n't the blanket approach the cause of all forms of discrimination ?
tj , uk -lrb- nigerian -rrb- just remember - the term racist can be applied to black on white just as much as white on black - or is that not politically correct thought .
i personally do n't a care a pair of fetid dingo 's kidneys what colour a person 's skin is , but some people do -lrb- fact , white and black -rrb- you ca n't legislate for a person 's thoughts .
alan , england it is pretty blatant that the criminal justice system is there to deal with crime and protect the criminal .
how incredibly frustrating this must be for the police , the majority of whom work hard , sometimes bending the rules to actively protect the victims .
let 's let them get on with their jobs and not have another threat hanging over them that if they make a harmless comment that can be interpreted in just such a way that they stand to lose all !
simon mallett , uk here we go again blaming the police , for arresting too many ethnic minorities , when will someone start looking at the numbers of crimes per head of population group to argue the case that the police are only doing their job , race does n't come into the equation unless you take account of the offences .
jon , uk the problem is n't racism so much ; it 's the perception of racism .
steve g , uk the problem is n't racism so much ; it 's the perception of racism .
people forget the actual definition of racism .
most people seem to think its white people penalising black people .
it is n't , it 's someone penalising someone else because of their race or skin colour .
it goes both ways , not just one .
until we have a system which removes the emphasis from the ethnicity and focuses on the crime itself , we 'll never have a cure to racism .
steve g , uk since when was it accepted that minorities are more involved in crime than whites ?
where do you get this assumption ?
you should come to the council estate where i live and see the number of crimes committed , with not a black , brown or any other non-white skin colour around .
st , uk racists in the police force are a minority and those that are tend to judge minorities based on the actions of a few .
funny really , because that is exactly the way most people view the police .
if a few are bad then they must all be bad .
maybe if the police led by example and did n't paint everyone with the same brush then maybe we would n't do the same to them .
although i do think if you dress like a " gangsta " you really do n't have much to complain about when stopped and searched and that goes to all gangsta wannabes of all races .
steve , london there are much worse things about the police than racism .
how about dishonesty , sexism , and laziness ?
obviously there are exceptions , but i have lived in areas where the police routinely lied to get convictions , and the laddish nature of many police officers is self-evident .
the ambience of every police station i have ever been to is one of indolence and ineffectiveness .
small wonder crime rates soar and arrests dwindle .
andrew , uk it is acknowledged that minorities are more involved in crime than whites .
so it makes sense that police officers target these minorities .
this has nothing to do with racism , but all with combating crime crispin , london , uk the police in britain have a privileged status .
offences committed against police officers are dealt with much more severely by the law .
for example , a minor assault against a police officer -lrb- say , pushing or a light slap -rrb- will draw a much heavier legal penalty than the same offence against a non-police civilian .
this is because as a society we rightly attach special importance to the work that the police do and the responsibility that goes with it .
by the same token , we should therefore take offences committed by serving police staff that much more seriously and the penalties should be that much more severe .
we have the right to expect high standards of our police because that 's part of the job they are paid -lrb- well -rrb- to do .
a crime such as verbal racism should never be tolerated in the police force as to do so is to grossly undermine the special status accorded to the police .
they ca n't have it both ways .
paul wilson , uk until i had personal involvement with the police i had no real feelings one way or the other .
however the way i was treated when arrested , with an obvious assumption of guilt even from those not directly involved , together with the lack of any concern , interest or humanity shown , has turned me against the police for ever .
the charges laid against me were eventually dropped but not before ruining my social and professional life .
and i am white , male and middle class .
the whole attitude of the police needs changing and i can quite believe that ethnic minorities get even worse treatment than i did .
andrew carter , uk the police have always concentrated on , and disliked those who create work for them .
we all have this attitude if we work with the public .
in the past it was the irish and the working class who received attention from the police and now it is primarily the black community .
this problem with the police is reflected everywhere in the world with a sizable black minority however nobody ever asks themselves why all other minorities such as the chinese , indian or turkish are shouting as loudly .
could it be that the police normally do n't bother them as they behave themselves ?
just a thought .
doug , london uk the key is to get a more diverse police force tim , uk the key is to get a more diverse police force .
as with any organisation , if the environment is robustly multicultural and the members rely on each other day in day out then there will be no racism , and certainly not institutionalised .
tim , uk if you dismissed people every time they did something wrong , you 'd have no workforce left !
elevating racism to the most serious misdemeanour of all lacks objectivity .
you 've got to consider the whole person and the contributions they are making in all areas of their job .
bill , uk i find it very interesting that many people complain in other contexts the police do not investigate crimes properly and sometimes do not even turn up when they are called , and that the interests of the criminal outweigh those of the victim .
yet when it 's the police themselves who are accused of something like racism they are suddenly beyond reproach .
jane , wales , uk it 's great when white people moan because something slightly racist comes there way .
i 'm white but i recognise that as the majority whites are the oppressors in this society - that might sound like a complete overstatement but it 's about time ' middle class white man ' realised that society is n't fair and it really is n't that big a deal to cut people some slack and certainly not big enough to start whining about things not being fair .
nick , london , uk the police are doing a great job given their restrictions .
we should give them a break , instead of being so judgemental .
amiel , uk once again the myth that black people get preferential treatment by playing the race card raises its ugly head .
of course any criminal is going to " try it on " using whatever excuse he can .
but the fact that only 6 % of complaints are upheld suggests to me that the benefit of doubt always comes down on the side of the police officer .
the current fuss arises because racism is not regarded seriously enough .
i wonder if there would be an objection to " one size fits all " if an officer was caught stealing or taking bribes .
charles moore , scotland surely our aim should be that a police officer should deal in a firm but considerate way with any member of the public .
can we please stop rattling on about racism and give the police a break .
christian tiburtius , uk as an increasingly multi-racial society our public services should reflect the diversity of the population .
that is very much not the case of the police force and recent efforts to recruit from ethnic minorities will be undermined if there is a perception that racism is being tolerated .
stuart fenton , uk the frequency of incidents of racism in the newspapers or in news will definitely hamper the faith of general public in professional policing however if we shield such incidences , we are indirectly encouraging the bad lot of policemen .
in my opinion we have to review our system from level one that is ' schools ' and in addition to this we have to educate the general public about their rights and what law offers them in case of an unfortunate event of racial discrimination .
gauav , india police officers are supposed to be custodians of justice .
racism is a great injustice surely meaning that guilty officers are contradicting their own job description , so it has to be a sacking offence .
it 's fair enough for the pca to say that every case should be considered individually but some clear , implementable strategy has to be put in place .
a policy of ' sacking unless able to prove sufficient reason for an incident ' would be fair .
if cases are n't clear-cut this would give officers the chance to justify their actions .
for the pca to shy away from implementing anything but a practical , definite means of dealing with this issue is like an endorsement of racism , or at the very least implies that this kind of behaviour is acceptable to ' some degree ' .
ryan smith , uk the answer must be in educating officers not immediately sacking them steve , hong kong i believe everybody to be racist to some degree in every multicultural society .
it is certainly not a condition confined to white people or police officers .
whilst there should be no tolerance of racism the police as far as possible recruit from a cross section of a society and will inevitably recruit officers who are racist to some degree even if the officer does not recognise the fact .
the answer must be in educating officers not immediately sacking them for some attitude that may have manifested itself during an incident where they were perhaps under severe stress .
if this zero tolerance to racist actions and views was adopted there would be very few persons who serve the public left in employment .
we unfortunately do not live in a perfect world .
steve , hong kong i dislike the idea of automatic penalties , since the degree of fairness is entirely down to how well thought-out the definition of " behaving in a racist way " is .
by judging each case on its own merits , the people passing judgement are forced to think about all the relevant factors , and the result will generally be a more balanced and fair outcome .
where racism is concerned , the very worst that can be done is to give fuel to the racists by making the system look biased in any way .
david hazel , uk it is clearly unacceptable that a few " bad apples " in the force will treat one ethnic group more severely than another , but just as unacceptable that a black suspect can be treated more leniently than a white suspect simply by claiming racism .
john b , uk although racism has been identified in the force by the macpherson report , little action has been taken on the key recommendations of the report .
this is where more work needs to be done to train the police to be culturally aware of people with different ethnic backgrounds .
stephen henstead , uk compulsory termination will not solve the issue .
we have problems of our own here in the usa , however we investigate each incident as it occurs .
most police officers want to do their job , go home , and feel appreciated for the job they do .
in our community we found that the appreciation part was not happening .
we have n't fixed it yet , but relations are improving .
best of luck .
carlton nielsen , usa it does n't matter whether it 's racist police , inefficient teachers or incompetent social workers - if they ca n't do their jobs competently , they should be fired .
what they do is too important to tolerate incompetence and the unions that represent them should acknowledge it .
why should taxpayers support any of them while they contribute to the deterioration of society ?
it does n't make sense .
fiona , scotland virtually everybody is guilty of prejudice of some sort be it comments against size , appearance , nationality or colour .
is it not discrimination to try and eradicate racism and leave all other prejudices untreated ?
this is not a perfect world but to try and give preferential treatment to non whites can only be to the detriment of racial harmony .
i for one think it is another example of this country bending over backwards to accommodate so called political correctness .
let the police get on with their already difficult job and not have to worry about senseless objections .
jason , england i would say that " zero tolerance " is called for , not until the police come to understand that they have to apply the law to themselves in they same way that they are eager to apply laws to the rest of us will anyone trust them .
richard , uk so very soon black criminals will not be arrested as white officers will be too scared to apprehend the culprits .
yet another case of the scales of " equal opportunities " being tipped in favour of non-whites then .
andy t , uk it 's a sad fact that there are some people from ethnic minorities who like to hold on to the idea of racism everywhere as an excuse for whatever bad things befall them .
if you want to solve the problem of real racism , you have to first get rid of these elements , which make up a majority of the statistics .
i 'm a white middle class male , if only i had something to blame when something goes wrong for me .
-lrb- do n't get me wrong , racism is evil and wrong , but people who falsely play the race card are just as wicked -rrb- chris , uk there 's no such thing as " institutional racism " because there is no such thing as a collective mind .
there are merely individuals who each take conscious decisions for their own actions , and who form their own opinions .
if there 's racism , deal with the individual source , black or white .
tom franklin , uk people need to start opening their eyes and realise that the police are there for our benefit jennifer , uk the police have a hard enough job as it is without everyone crying " racism " .
i have noticed that you hardly ever hear of a case where a white citizen has claimed racism even though the police force is of mixed race , yet any one who is not of white origin or from the uk manages to get away with it all the time .
people need to start opening their eyes and realise that the police are there for our benefit , no matter what your skin colour or where you come from .
imagine the uk without them and i do n't think you would like the outcome .
people sometimes say that the police do n't do a good job .
well , i am afraid i would have to disagree .
jennifer , uk as soon as a " one size fits all " policy such as this is introduced into any large organisation , like the police force ; you instantly switch the power slightly further away from the people doing their job , in favour those that want to make it hard for them to do it .
ben , usa institutional racism exists in many sectors .
the fact that a policeman is more likely to be accused of being a " racist " is unfortunately due to the nature of the job .
root out the individual racists yes , but do not provide the legal system with yet another stick to flog the police force and further compromise their effectiveness in dealing with criminals .
craig h , uk / south africa policemen and policewomen are doing a terrific job mark , singapore i am a foreign chinese student who has been studying in britain for nearly eight years .
i think policemen and policewomen are doing a terrific job and should be applauded for their high tolerance level when dealing with certain groups who are bent on pushing the boundaries of peace to the point of social discontent .
sacking any police officer found to have behaved in a racist way is appalling , especially if the individual in question has been provoked .
mark , singapore living in the us we see police brutality / racism towards minority citizens all the time .
if the policy of firing officers who displayed racist ideals was adopted in the us , half the police departments across this country would lose a lot of personnel overnight .
i agree with not only firing police officers who display racism , but prosecuting them for hate crimes .
ralph , chicago , illinois , us i was accused of being racist fiona k , uk i was once accused of being racist when i - as a team leader - brought to the attention of my manager the poor attendance , shoddy work , dreadful attitude , and appalling customer service of one my black team members .
we had customer complaints about him , the rest of us had to double check his work all the time , and he was rude beyond belief .
but it was said to me that " you could be perceived as racist if you continue to criticise him " .
that 's the trouble - perception is winning , not the truth .
any paranoid idiot can claim to " feel victimised " but whether they are or not is a very different matter .
fiona k , uk there is a huge difference between a police officer who is deliberately racist and one who appears so because he makes some insensitive remarks as a result of thoughtlessness or ignorance .
the first should be sacked ; the second should be offered training .
adam , uk sending someone on a course is never likely to work ; to say that some well chosen words can change a persons ingrained beliefs , however misguided and ignorant , is laughable .
once guilt of racism has been established then yes , the officer in question should be sacked .
chloe , uk i know i do n't trust white police officers rustam roy , england -lrb- ex-india -rrb- once guilt has been established , i fail to see any reason that would justify a racist police officer from retaining his or her job - the police force , after all , is supposed to look after all citizens equally and not just white english people .
as a non-english person myself , i know that i do n't trust white police officers until i have actually spoken to the person concerned and satisfied myself . .
if the government is serious , the pca must not be allowed to self-regulate and shield those of its officers who are racist .
rustam roy , england -lrb- ex-india -rrb- i take offence to rustam roy 's comments .
if i was to say that i would not trust a black or asian police officer i would quite rightly be branded racist !
not all white people are narrow minded bigots ! !
andrew , wales rustam roy : you do not trust ' white police officers ' .
what all of them ?
is this not racist ?
of course it is , but i expect that you are no more racist than the average police officer .
i suppose this just shows that it is not a cut and dried issue , as it is an individual 's perception of the behaviour of a certain group of people that often causes the stereotype feeling .
as such , each case should be taken on its merits .
steve caron , uk i am surprised at rustam roy 's remarks about not trusting " white officers " - is that to say that only white police officers are capable of racial discrimination ?
john tasker , thailand i do n't think that racism in the police force will ever be solved as long as racism and ghettos continue to exist in our society .
we need to tackle the issues at the root of the problem , such as reducing the gap between rich and poor , which is currently widening .
helen c , uk each case is different and to brand all police as racist is wrong as most are decent , extremely hard working people .
matt , uk we are all discriminatory in one way or another tony , england such a draconian approach would drive racists underground .
we are all discriminatory in one way or another and we all have a responsibility to understand our prejudices and how to modify our behaviour .
unfortunately i do believe people ' police ' to gain a powerful position and seek to abuse that position because of individual personality traits .
tony , england i live with a white police officer and i am very conscious of the racist abuse that he gets day in , day out from people who try and play the race card every time they commit a crime .
the whole of the world is institutionally racist - whether consciously or unconsciously .
it 's about time that the police stopped allowing criminals -lrb- whether white , black , asian or whatever race -rrb- to dictate the way the police force is run .
rebecca , uk controlling people 's thoughts will never ever work .
tom , england it 's proven fact that institutional racism does exist in the police force .
there should be zero tolerance of such behaviour .
we need to find quick and effective methods of investigating racist accusations and not let situations sit at red tape or let them drag on , where the victim feels that no justice has been done .
sharon , uk given 94 % of the 258 complaints made were found to be insubstantial ; it would appear that perhaps the problem is n't racism , but our exaggerated perception of racism ?
graeme phillips , germany , normally uk as soon as somebody feels maligned they shout racism nick , uk each case needs to be looked at individually .
as soon as somebody feels maligned in any way they shout racism .
carry on like this and nobody in their right mind will become a police officer , teacher , social worker ...
nick , uk since the likelihood of any complaint -lrb- racist or otherwise -rrb- against a police officer being upheld is negligible , any penalties are only of academic interest .
once again the police complaints authority shows that it is more concerned with protecting corrupt and criminal police officers from the consequences of their actions .
paul , england when the law says that an incident is ' racist ' if the victim thinks it was , then it 's clearly wrong to impose such a draconian penalty on every officer involved in such an incident .
it 's too easy for a criminal to accuse the police of racism and ruin someone 's career , whilst they pick up a nice few thousand in compensation .
the police should be protected , not vilified .

mobile phone ringtones are becoming more popular than cd singles , creating a boost for the music industry 's ailing sales .
improved technology means young mobile phone users can change their ringtones regularly with pop tunes and tv themes for between £ 1.50 and £ 3.50 a time .
the sugababes hit round round made a larger profit margin on the ringtone sales than on its single sales , music company universal has revealed .
can the music industry rely on ringtones to bolster its sales ?
is it a craze that will pass ?
do musical ringtones wind you up ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .

brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

mobile phone ringtones are becoming more popular than cd singles , creating a boost for the music industry 's ailing sales .
improved technology means young mobile phone users can change their ringtones regularly with pop tunes and tv themes for between £ 1.50 and £ 3.50 a time .
the sugababes hit round round made a larger profit margin on the ringtone sales than on its single sales , music company universal has revealed .
can the music industry rely on ringtones to bolster its sales ?
is it a craze that will pass ?
do musical ringtones wind you up ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .

i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

mobile phone ringtones are becoming more popular than cd singles , creating a boost for the music industry 's ailing sales .
improved technology means young mobile phone users can change their ringtones regularly with pop tunes and tv themes for between £ 1.50 and £ 3.50 a time .
the sugababes hit round round made a larger profit margin on the ringtone sales than on its single sales , music company universal has revealed .
can the music industry rely on ringtones to bolster its sales ?
is it a craze that will pass ?
do musical ringtones wind you up ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?

dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

mobile phone ringtones are becoming more popular than cd singles , creating a boost for the music industry 's ailing sales .
improved technology means young mobile phone users can change their ringtones regularly with pop tunes and tv themes for between £ 1.50 and £ 3.50 a time .
the sugababes hit round round made a larger profit margin on the ringtone sales than on its single sales , music company universal has revealed .
can the music industry rely on ringtones to bolster its sales ?
is it a craze that will pass ?
do musical ringtones wind you up ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .

shanda , south carolina , usa no .

rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .

it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !

chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

mobile phone ringtones are becoming more popular than cd singles , creating a boost for the music industry 's ailing sales .
improved technology means young mobile phone users can change their ringtones regularly with pop tunes and tv themes for between £ 1.50 and £ 3.50 a time .
the sugababes hit round round made a larger profit margin on the ringtone sales than on its single sales , music company universal has revealed .
can the music industry rely on ringtones to bolster its sales ?
is it a craze that will pass ?
do musical ringtones wind you up ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .

i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !

why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

mobile phone ringtones are becoming more popular than cd singles , creating a boost for the music industry 's ailing sales .
improved technology means young mobile phone users can change their ringtones regularly with pop tunes and tv themes for between £ 1.50 and £ 3.50 a time .
the sugababes hit round round made a larger profit margin on the ringtone sales than on its single sales , music company universal has revealed .
can the music industry rely on ringtones to bolster its sales ?
is it a craze that will pass ?
do musical ringtones wind you up ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .

the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .
but on the other side , i also think that is not very professional to be with an important client and that the " simpson 's " ringtone or other similar starts playing .
so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .
daniel , uk the average person 's cell phone use in public is very annoying .
now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

mobile phone ringtones are becoming more popular than cd singles , creating a boost for the music industry 's ailing sales .
improved technology means young mobile phone users can change their ringtones regularly with pop tunes and tv themes for between £ 1.50 and £ 3.50 a time .
the sugababes hit round round made a larger profit margin on the ringtone sales than on its single sales , music company universal has revealed .
can the music industry rely on ringtones to bolster its sales ?
is it a craze that will pass ?
do musical ringtones wind you up ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously bob , uk i think perhaps we take our mobiles too seriously .
in a world where we have to resort to mobile phones and fashion to express our individuality , i fear for the human race and the shallow people we 're becoming .
modern pop culture is just re-hash after re-hash of old songs or should i say " remix " after " remix " is there so little creativity left that pop has to resort to scavenging old songs ?
the only music that has any merit in my eyes is original material , played by the artists , live preferably , not some ghostly imitation or snippet on a mobile phone .
bob , uk i think pirates will take over this industry soon if companies start charging for it .
swadhin , india do n't we just love our culture ?
when a ringtone becomes music .
jazz ?
blues ?
chopin ?
beethoven ?
all these are obviously obsolete .
why do n't we just become the borg right now and get it over with ?
jim , us the next time i hear the a team theme blurt out from someone 's phone on the train , i think i will snap ! ! !
brian , sydney , australia the only reason i downloaded a ringtone was so that i could tell my own apart from other phones .
i did it to make the sound stand out , something individual .
that 's all , not to be cool or keep up to date with the latest trends .
it just makes it easier to recognise .
jessie , age 16 , queensland , australia it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them gina goicuria , costa rica on one side , it 's easier to have a different ringtone in order to distinguish when your cell is ringing .
let 's face it , every single person on the street caries a cell phone that sounds just like yours .

so it 's just a matter of knowing when to use them .
anyway , why spend money when there are a lot of web sites where you can download them for free ?
i do n't think this is the future of the music industry .
gina goicuria , costa rica i wish i had thought of this brilliant way of suckering money out gullible .
howard , uk mobile phone users should be regularly beaten about their heads with a sock filled with fresh horse dung .
maybe twice a day .
yesterday i was in a bookstore trying not to listen to woman shouting a conversation about her dog 's bowel movements .
peter c. kohler , usa with everything that 's happening in our world today , who cares ?
wendy , usa i could care less about ringtones and the impact it has on the music industry .
cell phones make people rude , intrusive , and lazy .
no one wants to hear a person 's personal phone conversation so why would anyone want to hear their ringtone ?
what ever happened to reading a book when you were bored ?
mj , usa my cellphone rings quite a lot , so if i downloaded one of my favourite songs as my ringtone , it would become one of my least favourite songs very quickly .
steve gilbert , usa i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer daniel , uk as a 16-year old i have never paid money for a ringtone but i compose my own tunes using my phone 's composer .
these tunes are better than most pop music anyway .
music is supposed to be an outlet for the creativity of the artist rather than its current state in which the only purpose of a pop group is to dance around looking pretty and making money for executives like simon cowell .
there should be more emphasis on live music , since the experience of a band playing their own songs with real feeling is something that can never be recreated digitally .

now that it has got to the point of paying for an annoying ringtone what could possible be next ?
who cares about the music industry 's future ?
we need to teach people proper phone etiquette .
rothschild , usa a phone is supposed to ring , anything other is tack .
a call is to be answered asap not so that one is able to listen and enforce ' music ' on others .
what ever next ? !
mr eades , cardiff my phone does n't even offer normal rings kari , california , us my new phone does n't even offer normal rings .
i wonder if the phone carries are in kahoots with the music industry .
just a thought .
kari , california , us this has to be the highest cost music format ever : £ 1.50-3.50 for 10 seconds of music .
people complain about the cost of cds , but the equivalent cost / listening time for 50 minutes on a cd is £ 450 to £ 1,050 !
the manufacturing and distribution costs must be tiny as well .
jim mcgonigal , uk who is sad enough to pay £ 1.50 / £ 3.50 for a different ring tone every week anyway ?
i think that it is a complete waste of money and the people who fuel this industry should take a long , hard look at themselves .
shocking !
bobby , uk ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones abhik , india ringtones are fun and are a pleasant change to the boring standard tones .
also it helps people to identify their phone by listening to the ringtone of the mobile user .
and having more options always help abhik , india i turned the ringtone off my phone as soon as i got it .
the vibration function serves perfectly well when my phone is in my pocket , on the table / desk , or even in my bag .
jonathan , england to those who say " this is the future " i would ask do you still have your digital watch with 99 musical alarms on it ?
thought not .
bob , uk when i were a lad the craze was musical digital watches -lrb- la cuceracha anyone .. ? -rrb- .
rather than ringtones , i think the real single replacement happens when we can buy , download and play mp3s on our phones , something that 's starting to happen now .
however , ringtones do show that there is a viable financial model at work here .
hugh , uk why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland well as they say technology is evolving all the time .
ringtones are nice , but how do you expect people to pay for them , as there are already now mobiles that use ordinary wav. files as ringtones .
these wav. files are basically the same as mp3 files , so you can actually hear the words in a song .
and anybody can make these files from an ordinary music track .
so why pay for it when you can get it for free ?
anders norrgrann , finland the future of the music industry is simple .
produce better quality , original music , that does n't rely of formulaic , repetitive reworks and manufactured bands .
ringtones are just another way of recycling their junk .
david , uk it will be more and popular , because everybody now has a hand phone in his / her pocket , instead of walkman or discman .
of course , mobile technology will be " money machine " even in near future !
budi putra , indonesia early telephone ring sounds -lrb- length of , and gap between , bell rings -rrb- were designed to be as " un-musical " as possible to get attention .
the amazing thing is that we learned to accept those ringtones so easily , and look back at them fondly .
ray , uk any time a corporation convinces you to express your " individuality " by overpaying for some cheesy gimmick , you 've been suckered .
people with personality do n't need to purchase one .
anthony , us ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry stuart bruce , uk ringtones are a temporary reprieve for the music industry .
it wo n't be long before most teenagers ' mobile phones are also mp3 players that play mp3 clips with a good sound quality when they ring .
then the kids will download their ringtones for free like they do with every other mp3 and another source of revenue will have dried up .
stuart bruce , uk just what we need , a way to make cell phones more obnoxious .
if american kids are into this , i am thankful that it has escaped my attention so far .
i ca n't think of anything more wasteful or shallow .
with any luck , the " music industry " will go belly up investing in this idiotic fad and real musicians will replace fabricated boy bands and american idols .
jim , nj , usa this can not be the case , future of the music industry ? ?
i find that comical ... you do not get any melodically satisfaction from a ring tone apart from showing off and angering fellow passengers on the tube .
chux , leeds let 's face it , as most " songs " in the chart today sound like they 'd been written on a phone 's composer , perhaps a phone is the best place to listen to them .
mark , scotland i remember when not so long ago you could get your ringtones free off the net .
personally i ca n't think of anything more annoying / embarrassing than having some silly ringtone blasting out at an inopportune moment .
a simple " ring ring " will do me ! !
plus it 's cheaper and leaves you money to buy proper music !
seb , france the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass struan grant , iceland this is a very exciting development culturally .
the future is in hand-held devices - ringtones are a bit annoying at the moment but that will pass .
held-held devices offer a great opening for musical innovation and to bring tunes to the masses in the format that clearly people want .
artists - get your thinking caps on ! !
struan grant , iceland ringtones are more popular than cd singles because ringtones have more musical content than the reconstituted music substitute which makes up most chart entries .
dave , uk the fact that a song made more money out of ringtones than as a record shows only that is was a poor record ; and no more .
greats like " stairway to heaven " or the great beatles tunes simply are n't done justice by some false , heartless , polyphonic imitation , and so are not desirable on a mobile .
ben , st louis , usa it 's always been one of my pet peeves to here a cell phone ring like a little electronic symphony or rock concert .
if it 's a phone , it should ring like a phone !
ryan , usa just another example of big business extracting money from the gullible .
i certainly would n't pay for a ring tone but then my mobile allows me to record my own .
when my wife calls i hear her voice , when a friend calls i hear my favourite band , when it 's a business call i get a serious normal ring .
kulu , uk vacuous , irritating , repetitive - yes , the music industry are on home ground here !
guy chapman , uk at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever dom , uk i find it staggering that the cost of buying a ringtone is so high .
clearly it 's aimed at teenagers - what a way to encourage young people to be sensible with their money !
at least with cd singles you have something you can keep forever .
dom , uk companies have been trying to keep with the youth market for 40 years , let alone dictate to it .
seems like they 've finally won though , this generation are just corporate clones ready and willing to rip themselves off in pursuit of the next piece of useless tech-crap that they 're offered .
it 's an ominous sign when art dies and a whole generation ca n't even comprehend the idea of an alternative .
enjoy your ringtones kids .
stephen merchant , england sure , the selling of ringtones is a great and profitable idea .
but is it the music industry 's future ?
no way .
this is novelty idea : i do n't know how many times i can hear the hook of my favourite tune without throwing the phone out the window anyway .
randall reynolds , united states finally ... somebody came up with something less musical than a rolf harris stylophone .
vaughan , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
guy matthews , uk could anything sum up more poignantly the diminished role of popular music in young people 's lives ?
future generations will find it incredible that pop once stood for energy , excitement , sex , rebellion and fun .
for them it will be just one more soulless corporate brand dressed up as consumer ' choice ' .
guy matthews , uk in 2003 , it seems that a person ’ s most valued and public expression of self seems to be embodied in the customized features of his cell phone .
think of all the time we spend customizing the millions of cell phone features .
with priorities like these , it ’ s no wonder we have so many problems in the world today .
on the upside , 20 seconds is about all i can stand of any of today ’ s music .
by the way , the insinuation that the music industry is in desperate financial troubles is an extreme exaggeration propagated by groups like the riaa who will say and do anything to thwart the music-loving consumer ’ s ability to obtain good music .
the attention given to the self-inflicted woes of the music industry detracts from the real tragedies of the music industry - a series of missed opportunities and a failure to recognize that the customer is always right .
shanda , south carolina , usa no .
i think the future for the music industry is in concerts and broadcasting rights .
online hosting will have to be outlawed except for the owners of the copyright with stiff penalties for anyone found hosting music and high rewards for anyone who reports them -lrb- from the very penalties -rrb- .
cds and mp3s are going to kill the industry , because once published , forever gone .
so live -lrb- concerts -rrb- or virtual streaming of music and concerts are the only hopes for this industry .
it must lobby , legislate and adapt or die .
simple as that .
amoroso gombe , kenya can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
rick , uk " musical " ringtones are without doubt the most annoying cultural development in recent history .
there is simply no excuse for them whatsoever .
there is nothing more likely to provoke a right-thinking citizen on public transport into an apocalyptic , violent frenzy than a tinny rendition of the theme tune from the a-team or such like .
and why do people feel the need to cycle through all their ringtones in a public place ? !
there are some that feel that their ringtone reflects something of their personality .
there is a word for these people , but for reasons of decency it can not be reproduced here .
please , for the sake of sanity , can a ridiculous and draconian law be passed to reintroduce the death penalty for ringtone use ?
it will save many lives .
especially during this heatwave , all it takes to trigger a bloodbath on a bus is someone 's phone going off ...
rick , uk yet again it does not surprise me that thousands of people are sucked in by yet another passing craze purely designed to make record and phone companies rich quick .
can people not see they are being ripped off ?
you ca n't even make out which tune they are supposed to be without letting it ring for ages by which time your caller has hung up !
anna , uk that ringtones are a more popular purchase than cd singles says more about the state of the singles market than anything else .
singles are overpriced to begin with but when you consider all you usually get for your fiver is one song remixed to death a couple of times then it hardly surprises me that ringtones are more popular .
perhaps if the music industry stopped accusing its customers of theft at every turn and concentrated on delivering the product the consumer wants in the way they want to receive it and at a sensible price then we 'd see more singles sold and they 'd not need to rely on a fad to boost their income .
bill , uk are people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham i understand that ringtones are marketed on the grounds that your are " expressing yourself " .
dear me , are that many people so shallow that their personality can be summed up by an irritating 10-second monophonic ditty ?
chris neville-smith , durham , england ah , bring back the days of vinyl , you went into a record shop and came out actually feeling like you bought something for your money - people cared more about music then .
dean osborn , uk forgive me if i 'm wrong , but are n't you meant to answer your phone when it rings ?
what 's the point in paying for a noise that you stop within a few seconds in order to use the phone for it 's intended purpose ?
if your silly enough to waste your money on paying for such a pointless thing , you have far more money than sense !
jim fielden , england i recently purchased a new mobile phone and was disgusted to find that there is no option to have a normal ' ring-ring ' type ringtone - instead , i am forced to subject all my colleagues to a polyphonic catastrophe .
as for paying for this form of aural torture , no way !
andrew lee , united kingdom to say that ringtones are replacing cds is like saying that soda bottle cap design has superseded oil paintings .
well it has , to those who do n't know any better .
leszek luchowski , poland people always want to personalise their property david , berkshire ringtones -lrb- and other new and upcoming novel services -rrb- are here to stay .
both the mobile networks and the music industry are desperate to increase their business now that handset and cd sales have slowed .
people always want to personalise their property in some degree , and the current pop hits have always been fashionable to carry around - i think i prefer a ringtone to a ghetto-blaster !
i work for a company that provides music on demand to the * caller * of the mobile phone , rather than the called - so be on the lookout for this new service when it 's introduced over here from korea where it 's already immensely popular .
david , berkshire , uk few things are more irritating than people who deliberately delay answering their phone just so that everyone around them can hear their fancy ringtone .
ralph , england what a silly argument !
people use them if its a song they like , but not to replace the song ... they often sound nothing like the original tune anyway , its like saying people hear elevator music versions of mozart more often than the orchestral versions , therefore , they must prefer it .
pure lunacy .
jim , uk well it just shows you how awful pop music is that it 's easier to sell the mobile phone version than the original .
jim coleman , uk i think a musical ringtone is about as stylish as a musical car horn and if you 're phone does n't just go ring-ring then you 're a prat .
am i getting old ?
ben , uk ben , uk : you are not getting old , everyone else is getting stupid colin , uk citizen in germany how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be ?
stuart , england ringtones are a complete rip off , you pay upwards of £ 1.50 for about 15 seconds of a song ! !
and how many times do they not sound like the song they are supposed to be -lrb- all types of ringtone -rrb- ?
the cd is here to stay - ringtones are a fad .
stuart , england just wait till the riaa -lrb- recording industry association of america -rrb- get their teeth into it , it will be a pound to download and 50p every time someone rings you as the riaa will say its public broadcasting !
mike , uk this is not a surprising move .
for generations people have identified themselves by their choice of music , and so it continues , albeit through a phone .
the record industry has been desperate to find ways of protecting and increasing revenue for some time now , so it 's not surprising they 're seizing this chance for profit .
alex , uk let 's keep a standard range for speaker output ; and an infinite range of music for headphone output only .
simon , england the music industry needs to realise their contribution to mankind is not of great importance carl , england the music industry needs to come to terms with reality and realise that their contribution to mankind is not of great importance .
with everyone now having the technology to create music and distribute it in easy form -lrb- mp3 , internet -rrb- music becomes a commodity .
unless ringtones are well done they are incredibly irritating .
since they will be around , please make them musical and not just irritating .
i personally thought many of the hit cd singles came from ringtones originally !
carl , england even polyphonic rings tones are incredibly irritating .
why have n't the phone makers built phones where you can either download mp3 's as ring tones , or allow you to record your own ?
that would be much more interesting ... when your phone says quietly " james , your mother-in-law is ringing you .
ring off now , or press the green button to talk " ...
james , uk you can get people to buy ringtones ?
what a brilliant idea .
why did n't i think of that ?
graham , uk like any new tech people are always crazy about it , when it becomes so common and cheap then it will become a thing of the past .
mbah william , dundee , uk my kids do n't change tunes - they 're bored with it ms , london the assumption here is that the music industry is falling and in trouble - well it 's not .
they make more than enough money as it is .
the ringtones fad is a way of boosting extra revenue for all concerned as the demand is generated by the public .
the people to blame are the phone manufacturers who developed the systems in the first place .
my kids do n't change tunes that often any more - it costs too much and they 're getting bored with it .
the craze i feel will pass .
ms , london i find " musical " -lrb- to borrow a hugely incorrect expression -rrb- ringtones are as annoying as cars with big bass boxes .
i can live without other people pushing their " favourites " on me .
justin thomas , england i think this proves that if the music industry can supply a product in a manner that suits the consumer at a price its willing to pay then it can still make a profit from selling music .
dave h , uk definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future krishna , uk it is not the music industry 's future but definitely it 's a journey for the better and successful future .
let 's wait and see in a couple of years ' time if an individual can use their favourite ringtones without consulting their network .
we do n't know yet what is on the other side of the coin .
i think someone has to monitor its development .
krishna , uk i just wish more people would set their phones to vibrate .
neil , us / europe a classic bit of marketing .
find a useless facet of a current piece of technology , tart it up and sell it to kids or those dumb enough not to know they 've been conned .
johnny , london technology and the way it is marketed is moving forward , better get used to it .
andy watkins , uk most polite people answer their phone as quickly as possible in public , such that the ringtone is irrelevant .
glen , england ringtones are easily accessible on the internet .
they are delivered straight to your phone .
i do not think this is the industry 's future however .
the producers need to lower their profit margins on other formats to increase sales .
very few people now are happy to pay £ 15 for an album .
especially with so much music being released .
selling mp3 format tunes over the internet at a reasonable rate would do much to increase the sales of tunes .
an improvement in the quality of music released would also win back the student buyers .
chris , england most definitely a craze - the huge popularity of mobile phones is in its infancy .
it 's only in the past couple of years that they have become pervasive with young people .
in a couple more years , having a phone will be no more exciting than wearing a wrist watch ...
and does anybody actually use the camera in their phone ?
stankley , usa if i found my child sitting with a group of friends playing each other their latest ringtones , i would walk on , shake my head and wonder where i had gone wrong .
it 's not that i 'm a sad middle-aged ex-hippy , you understand .
tb , uk do we really think the cd is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
mike , uk do we really think the cd etc is dead ?
will we dance round phones in clubs ?
to suggest this is just daft !
this is just another way of hearing a snapshot of existing music - it 's not a replacement for it .
having said that i hate ringtones ! : -rrb- mike , uk are people really so stupid that they can not programme in the ringtones themselves ?
shocking .
rob , england this just proves how the music monopolies are struggling to survive after missing all the opportunities it had to embrace the internet and file sharing .
any revenue stream where they can have total control over via licensing shows that they are not prepared to change their business model .
huw davies , s. wales it really is pathetic is n't it ?
remember one thing : a mobile phone ringtone , never mind how bad it is , can never be ironic .
please bear this in mind .
toby , uk " computer games killed the muuusic industreee " ...
oh no , sorry , that 's not how the song goes !
or is it ?
richie , uk in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more backward than ever tom , uk ever since computers came along the music industry has had its head buried in the sand .
and now , in the ' simon cowell ' era the industry looks even more idiotic and backward than ever .
i spend my money on computer games and download real music for free .
the ' music industry ' -lrb- what a joke ! -rrb- deserves everything that 's coming to it .
tom , uk it 's a big indictment of the record industry that they will charge the same for a poor quality 10-second snippet of music as they have for a single .
do they have any idea of value ?
what is even worse is people will pay these outrageous prices .
do n't they know you can buy phones that record ringtones ?
they are no more expensive than other phones and have been around for several years .
james newman , uk now maybe the record companies should stop making such a fuss about sites like napster and co if they are now making money from something like the ringtone sales market which five years ago was n't really there .
andy , london , uk to be honest it is all these songs are good for .
nic hobson , england if the tunes were n't popular anyway people would n't buy them for their phones .
the distribution mechanism for ringtones is also more efficient , there are no physical goods to ship from place to place .
if the record companies would sell singles in mp3 format over the internet i think they could achieve a fair profit margin .
ian clark , uk has our attention span dropped so low we opt for the 10-second melody ?
gerry , uk has our attention span dropped so low that we can no longer listen to a single cd and instead opt for the 10-second melody of a mobile phone ?
gerry , uk ringtones can be downloaded legally , very quickly and for a price which people are willing to pay .
as soon as we get the same sort of option for singles , then i 'm sure that the sales will increase again .
in the meantime , the record industry is still making plenty of profit on ringtones rather than expensive singles , so they should stop complaining about falling sales in this area .
paul o , uk with people able to select from so many ringtones the days of 20 people scrabbling to check their phones are hopefully long gone .
the only downside is kids who insist on scrolling through all their downloaded tunes at rock concert volume .

extreme weather will continue in the uk with sweltering heat in the south and cooler weather in the north .
sunday saw the recording of the hottest day ever in britain when the temperature in gravesend , kent soared to 38.1c -lrb- 100.6f -rrb- .
more heat wave photos a further selection of your pictures in pictures but torrential rain and thunder storms hit parts of northern england and the midlands .
are you enjoying the heat wave or do you find it too hot ?
do you have any good tips for keeping cool ?
how are you coping at work ?
are your pets suffering in the heat ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : due to my total physical inability to stand what many people would consider mild heat , i 'm hating this .
conventional medicine does not recognise my ' condition ' so i 'm forced into hiding away with a fan , closed curtains and regular cold showers just to stay comfortable .
it 's absolutely incomprehensible to my body how people can like this weather , or even anything approaching it , and i wish i could enjoy it similarly .
andy , nottm , uk i can enjoy the weather when i am not at work and do n't have to travel steph , england i can enjoy the weather when i am not at work and do n't have to travel .
i am complaining about the hot stuffy tube or late running mainline service only to have to sit in a non-air conditioned office for the majority of the day only to return home to a house that is too hot because it 's been closed up all day .
the travelling takes the joy and energy out of me and by the time i get home i am too exhausted to do anything other than drop after a nice cold shower .
steph , england the hot weather is great .
what is n't so great is those many thousands of people who do n't realise deodorant and regular changes of clothing are a must in this weather !
david hughes , england the people in this country are never happy , and we like it that way .
in the last year we have had great weather ; a blustery autumn , loads of snow at winter , a sunny spring , and a stunningly hot summer .
by rights we should not be complaining at all ... but that would be uncharacteristic of us .
fortunately , our public transport system ca n't cope with any form of weather whatsoever - so we can all continue to moan and sulk .
ali , england the weather is fantastic , do n't let us forget that it is peak holiday season and those who are having a well deserved break should be allowed to enjoy the weather .
all those who are complaining because they are at work are simply jealous -lrb- and i write this in my non-air conditioned office -rrb- mike , uk i 'm willing to bet that those who tell us to " stop whinging about the heat " are the very same people who , on a winters morning in a freezing wind , cheerfully whistle loudly before telling us all what a ' glorious day ' it is !
do they know how annoying that is , and that everyone just wants to see the ground open up and swallow them ?
gerry noble , uk with the british climate changing the houses should be fitted with ceiling fans .
at the moment the houses are made to keep out the cold winter winds .
this makes homes too hot in the summers .
hyder ali pirwany , england adopt our local siesta when the sun is too strong at noon !
lia , greece that 's funny !
all northern europeans claim it 's too hot , but when they come to greece , they spend 12 hours a day sunbathing until they probably catch a skin cancer .
enjoy it now that you do n't have to pay for it , drink water , eat fruits , and adopt our local siesta when the sun is too strong at noon !
lia , greece for some of us it is n't a case of " whingeing " about the heat .
it actually causes health problems so do n't lump us all in the same boat just because we ca n't enjoy this weather .
roll on the autumn / winter when i can breathe again .
david , uk if you find the heat difficult and a problem , please have some thoughts for my wife who is eight months pregnant .
this heat is causing her to be very uncomfortable ; she can not wait for it to cool down .
andy g , cov , uk can we nail the global warming thing once and for all ?
all models predict for the uk on average : slightly warmer summers , much warmer winters , hardly any change in rainfall , and reduced windiness .
in short , the uk will continue to be a rather nice place to be , spoilt only by the moaning tendency of a substantial ignorant minority .
tom , uk i was travelling to madrid some couples of days ago and the bus that i was in was so hot that i thought that hell had broken loose due to the heat .
it is a devastating life indeed .
chernor jalloh , almeria , spain scotland in particular is notorious for having miserable weather , and indeed some summers are very wet and depressing .
to have some sunshine is fantastic and we should all enjoy it while it lasts .
as soon as the first burst of rain you can be sure that we will all start moaning again .
if people find it too hot anyway , why do so many of us go abroad to much hotter tourist resorts ?
explore scotland first i say and you 'd be amazed at how beautiful it is when the sun is shining !
rob , scotland until the public transport can cope , we should be given automatic bank holidays suzana , uk i love the hot weather the only thing that bothers me is getting on the tube .
until the public transport can cope , we should be given automatic bank holidays whenever it 's over 30c .
surely there are rules that prevent you from transporting animals this way , so why ca n't we get a day off as well ?
suzana , uk i grew up on the us east coast , where the summers are regularly hotter than this -lrb- and the winters regularly colder -rrb- .
so i 've been enjoying a little taste of old-time summertime .
it 's been lovely !
not all my native born and bred friends seem to agree , but they complain about the cold all winter , too - some people are never satisfied .
carl , england flies , wasps , bugs , underground stations and shops choking with heat , sweat , insomnia , drought , ugly pink and red bodies on slow cook .
what a nightmare !
am i the only man in britain who absolutely adores winter ?
it can never be too cold .
richard montgomery , uk i cope with this heat by staying at my workplace morning , noon and night .
at least they 've got air conditioning and an amply supplied restaurant .
an added bonus : my boss thinks me a dedicated worker now .
vonette , holland yes it is far too hot !
i live in a ground floor flat and i do n't like leaving windows open when i go out or at night !
a tip for poor sleeping is to immerse you feet in a bucket of cold water for several minutes before retiring !
len williams , england the uk just is n't geared up to cope with similar weather !
christina , england i have lived and worked on a kibbutz in israel where it was normal to have hotter weather than this !
we started work in the orange groves and cotton fields at 4am and finished at 10am to avoid the hottest time of day .
we had siesta in the afternoon and leisure activities at night .
it was a great experience , but the uk just is n't geared up to cope with similar weather !
christina , england i moved to australia in 1988 and have encountered many days of 40c plus without air conditioning .
have regular cold showers or a swim .
enjoy the sun in the evening when it is n't so fierce and the sun sets are magical and remember only mad dogs and english men go out in the midday sun .
giles wragg , australia i did n't know what all the fuss was about till i realised that you guys do n't " do " air conditioning up there .
that is tough .
temps here in oklahoma range from 90f to 110f .
90f is a pretty cool day during our hottest months ... but air conditioning is the norm .
when i first moved out and did n't have that luxurious cool air , i took at least three showers a day and kept a wet rag in my hand to wipe my face and arms ... kind of homemade air conditioning .
good luck to ya 'll .
cyndi walkup , tulsa , ok , usa to be honest , the weather here is quite ok compared to the rest of the world .
but maybe i 'd better think again about whether to invite my grandparents to come here for their holidays next summer .
helen fei , china -lrb- in bolton , england for sixth form education -rrb- i work in an engine room and have seen the temperature on the first ship i sailed with rise to 72 celsius in the far east .
now moan about the uk .
the average temperature in a ships machinery space in warmer countries is 42 degrees c and after a couple of weeks it all seems pretty normal .
just get used to it and enjoy .
mark chisholm , uk it should be a lesson that the world has to be careful with the ozone layer !
mwanzi josephat , tanzania i thought it 's only mwanza -lrb- tanzania -rrb- has been affected with the increasing heat !
we taka shower 4 times or so per day , we put on light clothes though some young girls go beyond that ... light , transparent and short gowns !
it should be a lesson that the world has to be careful with the ozone layer !
mwanzi josephat , tanzania in a weeks time this will all be forgotten and we can all get back to complaining about how cold and wet it is .
john , uk you 're all saying it 's too hot .
as soon as this " heat wave " ends you 'll all be complaining it 's too * cold * !
here in central california it 's often over 120 " f - for weeks on end .
it can be 110 " f in the * shade * .
enjoy the change , and just be glad you 're not * here * .
michael austin , southern california , usa -lrb- ex uk -rrb- moan moan moan .
the only thing that 's really suffered since the -lrb- lovely -rrb- hot weather started has been conversation .
enjoy it while you can and stop whinging andrea , uk can people not see what worrying effects pollution and the inability of anybody , these days , to attempt to recycle the earth 's resources is having on our planet ?
feeling suffocated and constantly yearning for a drink is not my idea of bliss .
and living in britain , it should n't be !
i 'm sure opinions differ in other countries where beautiful forests are turned to ashes with no chance of damage limitation because the climate is so excruciatingly dry .
emma , uk fantastic !
love it !
could live in this every day !
life would be wonderful if it was n't for the pathetic performance of the railways !
arabella , uk i 'm not sure how anyone can say this is glorious .
it 's so hot you ca n't go outside , it 's too hot to be productive at work , and it 's too hot for my young baby .
dom , uk at least the wines of vintage 2003 should be excellent !
carl , france here in the centre of france we have had 10 consecutive days around + 40c .
although france is used to higher temperatures than britain , nobody can remember a summer this bad .
for us in our first year of our plant nursery business , we have certainly been kept busy with the watering - luckily we have a very good and deep well .
for once the weather is the no .
1 topic of conversation here too !
still at least the wines of vintage 2003 should be excellent !
carl , france i 'm working in an office with no air conditioning or fans just old fashioned windows .
the underfloor heating is still on since it 's broken -lrb- apparently - funny how in winter it 's broken then as well , just so it 's off and we all freeze -rrb- .
i 've lost two stone in two weeks - it 's great , though we all do tend to smell a bit pungent now .
s , uk i 've got one thing to say - this country has gone to the dogs .
we spend eight extra hours in the winter sitting in snow on the motorways and we spend five extra hours in the summer sitting on the trains !
what does the future hold for us ?
becky , hants - uk i have some friends who have come to the uk to cool down .
they live in dubai , where the temperature is in the high 40s to 50s .
andy , uk enjoy the great weather but be sure to do what we do here in sunny southern california : wear a hat and sun-screen and drink plenty of water before you are thirsty .
do not drink alcohol or caffeine drinks .
the human body is designed to take-the-heat if you help it .
enjoy !
michael , california , usa i love fine weather but this beyond a joke trisha , wallingford it is too hot ; i ca n't sleep even though i have two fans in the bedroom .
i love fine weather but this beyond a joke .
colleagues in work ask why i ca n't cope as i did live in cyprus for three and half years .
air conditioning , marble floors and sea breezes .
20 degrees lower and i would be comfortable .
trisha , wallingford i love the summer , although i am fair skinned and so can not sunbathe much at all .
i would like it to be a few degrees cooler just to be able to cope better when i am out and about .
we should n't be complaining too much as we do n't get decent weather like this too often .
i much prefer the heat to the cold , cold winter .
tracey , uk i ca n't understand the constant descriptions of extremely hot weather as being " glorious " , " fantastic " , " healthy " -lrb- ! -rrb- and cold winter weather as being the complete opposite .
being a redhead and of a fair complexion this weather is excruciating for me and i resent the notion that i 'm something of a " killjoy " because i do n't enjoy it .
we are not all sun-worshippers - roll on october !
colette , york , england i am absolutely loving the heat - and long may it last !
this last weekend -lrb- when we finally broke the 100 degree barrier -rrb- , i walked 20 miles in the surrey hills on saturday , cycled 60 miles on sunday morning and played football in hyde park on sunday afternoon .
i have developed a nice tan and saved myself a fortune by not having to go to ibiza to have the same amount of fun !
chris , london , uk if you think this heat is wonderful come down to the south-east for a day and see how much you can bear it then !
the problem is that this country is not prepared for such extremes of temperature such as this .
yes , it would be wonderful to go to spain or greece and for the weather to be like this , but there they have air conditioning , swimming pools , white houses with flat roofs and no carpets designed to reflect heat ...
bring on autumn !
anna , england for all those pessimists who are moaning not only about the hot weather , but all the impact of global warming and how we are destroying the earth .
well the earth , together with mother nature will sort out most of the damage we have caused i reckon .
they are great healers .
climatic change was inevitable and if it makes england more tropical ... well bring it on ! ! !
sharon , uk bad weather is when you 're wearing unsuitable clothing randy , uk i cope with hot weather similarly to cold weather .
i adapt to it .
as billy connolly said , there 's no such thing as bad or good weather .
bad weather is when you 're wearing unsuitable clothing .
whatever the weather , accept it , stop moaning and get on with it .
why this constant concern with weather extremes ?
have n't we lived in this country long enough to blow it right off the comments agenda ?
the way some people describe it , it 's as good as someone 's fault that the weather changes .
grow up , you lot .
randy , uk it 's great !
please stop moaning everyone .
of course it 's hot but constantly banging on about it wo n't change it and certainly wo n't help you stay cool !
i 'm sure those carping about the current weather will also be the first to moan when the rain comes back .
lucy , uk oh yes the heat waves great , apart from being stuck in a train carriage with 700 other people for five hours last wednesday , three hours last night and again for two hours this morning in over 100 degrees of heat with no ventilation and no air conditioning .
no i 'm not travelling to scotland every day just trying to get to work and home again .
the infrastructure in this country is a disgrace .
other countries suffer extremes of weather but do not suffer these problems .
no ones ever accountable or to blame .
it 's about time the government stopped playing world power and stopped throwing our money -lrb- taxes -rrb- around abroad and spent it sorting out the diabolical infrastructure in this country , maybe then we could all enjoy the heat wave without fainting .
alan baker , england nudism .
that 's how i 'm coping .
the nude rambler had the right idea - delete the clothing and chill out !
nudism is guaranteed to get a seat -lrb- if not a whole compartment -rrb- to yourself on the commuter trains , too !
nick hing , uk levels of smog have been at unacceptable and dangerous levels alf , cambridge i work as an air quality officer in cambridge - this weather is concerning and is showing a general upward trend of temperatures year on year .
i can not believe there are still people out there claiming it is good for children and fun .
levels of smog -lrb- highly dangerous for children and others alike -rrb- have been at unacceptable and dangerous levels in parts of the county .
what is it going to take to wake up some of the naive public ?
increase in asthma , bronchial problems , skin cancers , smog , nitrogen dioxide , particulates and i have still seen parents allowing children to run around in temps of 36 degrees with no hats on .
wakey wakey !
alf , cambridge , uk i do n't see what people are moaning about .
this weather is great !
it makes me feel good , is very healthy , and has n't lasted too long .
those spouting about global warming do n't know what they 're talking about .
heat waves like this regularly happened throughout the last century and before .
the longest in terms of drought lasted through 1975 to 1976 .
long before it became fashionable to be concerned about co2 emissions .
tom , uk come on everybody sing along ...
" the sun has got his hat on hip hip hooray , the sun has got his hat on and he 's coming out to play ... "
fantastic weather long may it continue !
danny , uk global warming scenarios are making me really worried joan lee , uk i love the sun , hate the dull , grey weather we get in winter ; but these high temperatures are ott .
air conditioning may help comfort but it consumes yet more fossil fuels , worsening global warming .
ever-worse global warming scenarios are making me really worried for my 1 year old nephew 's generation .
thanks , bbc weather people for acknowledging that this heatwave is hard work for some people .
it would really make my day if you could tell me it 's going to cool down in the se and stay cool .
i hear in europe some rivers are drying up .
i am really worried about the same happening here , if they are not replenished by rainfall this winter .
joan lee , uk come on folks this is glorious .
enjoy it while we can it will soon be back to normal .
only question is , why ca n't our transport system cope ?
my trains have been a nightmare for the last 2 weeks .
if so called 3rd world countries can keep there trains running why ca n't we .
i love this weather but having my working day extended by and hour or more is not funny .
it could only happen in england anywhere else and there would be riots !
bill , england every summer i vow that one day , i 'll immigrate to iceland .
maybe one day i will .
this heat wave has certainly reminded me of why i want to head north .
one can dress up warm against the cold , the heat is altogether far harder to deal with .
andrew , british in the netherlands i hope that this weather carries on for at least two more months .
it is good for the children while off school and we all go away to the sun but now we have it here .
it may not be good for some of the old or infirmed but then the rest of us should help them by doing there shopping or gardening .
this is not extreme weather as looking back through history britain was once a tropical area .
we should enjoy it as next year it could rain all summer .
the reporters should stop moaning and just report it as it is and not keep telling us about it being muggy and too hot .
long may it go on and keep people in there home country and not spending abroad .
colin , uk it is evident that the planet is heating up due to human greed and stupidity misha , uk reading these comments i find the level of denial shocking .
what does it take to open people 's eyes ?
we can measure the hole in the ozone layer ; it is evident that the planet is heating up due to human greed and stupidity .
the glaziers are melting and we will pay for this ' nice ' weather by having torrential downpours - antarctica is going to come down on us , you better believe it .
am i the only one who is outraged that we are still relying on fossil fuels and nuclear power when there are so many safe and sustainable alternatives ?
misha , uk how to beat the heat - this works on trains , buses , tubes , cars etc .
get a half litre bottle of water , and freeze it overnight .
take it out of the freezer about an hour before you set off , to give it a chance to melt a bit .
then you can hold it to cool your hands , and sip it to cool your insides .
i had one yesterday and it lasted until just after lunch .
fantastic , and the best bit is the other travellers enviously licking their lips .
jeremy smith , uk the weather is beautiful and very welcome .
unfortunately when you are facing 14 weeks of road works -lrb- bus lane being installed -rrb- and are stuck in traffic on public transport some with heaters still going , it is not funny .
more like torture !
having to face this morning and evening rather takes the enjoyment out of the sunshine .
lynne , uk you 've taken our soaps , rolf harris , clive james and kylie minogue , now you can have some of our australian weather .
enjoy it while it lasts !
ann teak , australia to all those who wish for this heat wave to be over - can i just say you are all mad !
each year we spend hundreds of pounds to get away from the english summer weather but these past couple of weeks have saved me a fortune !
yes it can be uncomfortable but you wo n't hear me moaning about it !
adapt with the weather !
get outdoor tasks done early morning or in the evening !
stay away autumn / winter !
david , england take it easy and keep hydrated richard amos , usa -lrb- ex uk -rrb- here in southern california it might be hot , but we do enjoy air conditioning everywhere .
it must be terrible back home right now .
just take it easy , and keep hydrated .
i do n't believe that once again the rail system is affected by the heat .
i suppose it makes a change from the wrong kind of leaves !
since leaving the uk , i 've lived in ontario , canada -lrb- -30 c -rrb- , and now southern california -lrb- + 40 c -rrb- , and i 've yet to see buckled rail tracks !
richard amos , usa -lrb- ex uk -rrb- i hate this hot weather and wish it would end soon , i do n't know how much longer the kids and i can bear it , we 're already starting to flag with headaches and exhaustion .
we 're going through so much water we could take shares in the water company !
i prefer 23 degrees , cool enough to wear a suit but warm enough to wear something nice and slinky too .
louise carlton , uk i agree with the fact that this sort of weather is delightful when you can appreciate it .
however like many have said , when you work in an office and have no air con it 's an absolute nightmare .
i think companies need to look at this as a serious issue !
vicky , uk to some of the americans who have made comments to the british to quit whining ought to have their hand smacked .
i start my day in an air conditioned home and leave for an air conditioned office .
the usa is set up to handle the high temperatures in the summer .
you ought to hear our whining though when there is an electrical blackout !
so , i can definitely sympathize with your situation over there , and i hope it gets cooler soon for all of you .
donna , usa -lrb- ohio -rrb- it stops me from being able to dash about getting things done and i constantly perspire - yuk !
jayne , uk i can not cope with the heat .
it stops me from being able to dash about getting things done and i constantly perspire - yuk !
however it is still a bit of a pain when the weather keeps harping on about the heat wave and record temps when you live in the north east and it 's freezing and wet !
do n't keep forgetting about us lot up here , we do exist !
jayne , uk although , it sounds quite nice to have such not weather this summer .
underlying this change could mean something is wrong with the environment .
i 've heard that parts of antarctica been melted , being seen floating around southern america !
can you imagine if this goes on for like next year , do n't think that it can be a threat to other parts of the globe .
hearing the forest fires in canada and portugal was quite horrific .
extreme weather will only mean more natural disasters !
yvonne , uk it 's about time we got some warm weather .
just getting out there and enjoying it , drinking lots and ignoring all the people who moan about the weather all the time .
shame it does n't last all summer and shame it 's probably not going to last till autumn . love it .
sergio , uk this weather is fantastic !
what a great summer in the uk at last !
my office is boiling everyday and my bedroom roasting at night , but it 's too hot to be moaning about that !
we brought a paddling pool to cool off after work anyway .
let 's just stop making such a fuss and enjoy the few weeks we 're having because as history shows , it probably is n't going to happen again for another 13 years .
kirsty , uk what heat ?
i thought it was just warming up !
nick james , uk what heat ?
i thought it was just warming up !
trouble is we in britain never get a chance to acclimatise properly - the weather changes too frequently .
the humidity is the killer , because we are n't used to it .
nor the air suffocating pollution .
overseas , buildings , towns and cities are better built and planned for the environment .
oh well .
the price we pay for living in such densely populated chaos , lack of investment and forward planning .
maybe we 'll get it right in time for the next ice-age .
nick james , uk i 'm really enjoying this unusual spell of summer weather .
it would just be nice if our non air conditioned , virtually windowless office was n't 44 degrees at the moment , and we were n't being expected to carry on as if it were 18 degrees .
but outside of work , i love it !
dan , uk i lived in japan for years and they get temperatures like this through july and august .
this and the humidity can be unbearable especially as they still wear suits to work !
but they have a great aircon infrastructure -lrb- even in the subways -rrb- and their railway tracks do n't buckle .
what is it with british railways ?
pathetic !
ben , uk the more of this weather the better tim , kiwi in london i love it !
the more of this weather the better i say .
bring on the sun , enjoy the parks and the pools and the beaches and the ice creams and the cold lagers and the pimms and the warm evenings in the back garden and the bbqs and the smiles on the kiddies faces and the cricket and the flowers and the .. did i mention cold lagers ?
i hate winter ...
tim , kiwi in london without humidity , the uk really does n't feel that hot -lrb- unless using what little public transport is running -rrb- .
in bahrain , the apparent temperature today is a balmy 54c , i.e. 132f .
texans have it easy .
jez , bahrain if you 're finding it too hot just trying storing your clothes in the fridge .
change t-shirts every half hour and you stay cool and fresh all day long .
gets you funny looks in the office , mind , ben , uk i 'm melting and not finding it joyous or refreshing in the least jen , uk -lrb- ex .
usa -rrb- being an american from kentucky , i 'm used to a lot higher temps than what we had in brum on saturday -lrb- 34c -rrb- but , saying that , i 'm also used to having aircon in the house , the car , and every shop , store and office .
being in the uk now , 5 months pregnant , i 'm melting and not finding it joyous or refreshing in the least .
for those who tell us to stop whingeing , try being pregnant without aircon !

extreme weather will continue in the uk with sweltering heat in the south and cooler weather in the north .
sunday saw the recording of the hottest day ever in britain when the temperature in gravesend , kent soared to 38.1c -lrb- 100.6f -rrb- .
more heat wave photos a further selection of your pictures in pictures but torrential rain and thunder storms hit parts of northern england and the midlands .

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : due to my total physical inability to stand what many people would consider mild heat , i 'm hating this .
conventional medicine does not recognise my ' condition ' so i 'm forced into hiding away with a fan , closed curtains and regular cold showers just to stay comfortable .
it 's absolutely incomprehensible to my body how people can like this weather , or even anything approaching it , and i wish i could enjoy it similarly .
andy , nottm , uk i can enjoy the weather when i am not at work and do n't have to travel steph , england i can enjoy the weather when i am not at work and do n't have to travel .
i am complaining about the hot stuffy tube or late running mainline service only to have to sit in a non-air conditioned office for the majority of the day only to return home to a house that is too hot because it 's been closed up all day .
the travelling takes the joy and energy out of me and by the time i get home i am too exhausted to do anything other than drop after a nice cold shower .
steph , england the hot weather is great .
what is n't so great is those many thousands of people who do n't realise deodorant and regular changes of clothing are a must in this weather !
david hughes , england the people in this country are never happy , and we like it that way .
in the last year we have had great weather ; a blustery autumn , loads of snow at winter , a sunny spring , and a stunningly hot summer .
by rights we should not be complaining at all ... but that would be uncharacteristic of us .
fortunately , our public transport system ca n't cope with any form of weather whatsoever - so we can all continue to moan and sulk .
ali , england the weather is fantastic , do n't let us forget that it is peak holiday season and those who are having a well deserved break should be allowed to enjoy the weather .
all those who are complaining because they are at work are simply jealous -lrb- and i write this in my non-air conditioned office -rrb- mike , uk i 'm willing to bet that those who tell us to " stop whinging about the heat " are the very same people who , on a winters morning in a freezing wind , cheerfully whistle loudly before telling us all what a ' glorious day ' it is !
do they know how annoying that is , and that everyone just wants to see the ground open up and swallow them ?
gerry noble , uk with the british climate changing the houses should be fitted with ceiling fans .
at the moment the houses are made to keep out the cold winter winds .
this makes homes too hot in the summers .
hyder ali pirwany , england adopt our local siesta when the sun is too strong at noon !
lia , greece that 's funny !
all northern europeans claim it 's too hot , but when they come to greece , they spend 12 hours a day sunbathing until they probably catch a skin cancer .
enjoy it now that you do n't have to pay for it , drink water , eat fruits , and adopt our local siesta when the sun is too strong at noon !
lia , greece for some of us it is n't a case of " whingeing " about the heat .
it actually causes health problems so do n't lump us all in the same boat just because we ca n't enjoy this weather .
roll on the autumn / winter when i can breathe again .
david , uk if you find the heat difficult and a problem , please have some thoughts for my wife who is eight months pregnant .
this heat is causing her to be very uncomfortable ; she can not wait for it to cool down .
andy g , cov , uk can we nail the global warming thing once and for all ?
all models predict for the uk on average : slightly warmer summers , much warmer winters , hardly any change in rainfall , and reduced windiness .
in short , the uk will continue to be a rather nice place to be , spoilt only by the moaning tendency of a substantial ignorant minority .
tom , uk i was travelling to madrid some couples of days ago and the bus that i was in was so hot that i thought that hell had broken loose due to the heat .
it is a devastating life indeed .
chernor jalloh , almeria , spain scotland in particular is notorious for having miserable weather , and indeed some summers are very wet and depressing .
to have some sunshine is fantastic and we should all enjoy it while it lasts .
as soon as the first burst of rain you can be sure that we will all start moaning again .
if people find it too hot anyway , why do so many of us go abroad to much hotter tourist resorts ?
explore scotland first i say and you 'd be amazed at how beautiful it is when the sun is shining !
rob , scotland until the public transport can cope , we should be given automatic bank holidays suzana , uk i love the hot weather the only thing that bothers me is getting on the tube .
until the public transport can cope , we should be given automatic bank holidays whenever it 's over 30c .
surely there are rules that prevent you from transporting animals this way , so why ca n't we get a day off as well ?
suzana , uk i grew up on the us east coast , where the summers are regularly hotter than this -lrb- and the winters regularly colder -rrb- .
so i 've been enjoying a little taste of old-time summertime .
it 's been lovely !
not all my native born and bred friends seem to agree , but they complain about the cold all winter , too - some people are never satisfied .
carl , england flies , wasps , bugs , underground stations and shops choking with heat , sweat , insomnia , drought , ugly pink and red bodies on slow cook .
what a nightmare !
am i the only man in britain who absolutely adores winter ?
it can never be too cold .
richard montgomery , uk i cope with this heat by staying at my workplace morning , noon and night .
at least they 've got air conditioning and an amply supplied restaurant .
an added bonus : my boss thinks me a dedicated worker now .
vonette , holland yes it is far too hot !
i live in a ground floor flat and i do n't like leaving windows open when i go out or at night !
a tip for poor sleeping is to immerse you feet in a bucket of cold water for several minutes before retiring !
len williams , england the uk just is n't geared up to cope with similar weather !
christina , england i have lived and worked on a kibbutz in israel where it was normal to have hotter weather than this !
we started work in the orange groves and cotton fields at 4am and finished at 10am to avoid the hottest time of day .
we had siesta in the afternoon and leisure activities at night .
it was a great experience , but the uk just is n't geared up to cope with similar weather !
christina , england i moved to australia in 1988 and have encountered many days of 40c plus without air conditioning .
have regular cold showers or a swim .
enjoy the sun in the evening when it is n't so fierce and the sun sets are magical and remember only mad dogs and english men go out in the midday sun .
giles wragg , australia i did n't know what all the fuss was about till i realised that you guys do n't " do " air conditioning up there .
that is tough .
temps here in oklahoma range from 90f to 110f .
90f is a pretty cool day during our hottest months ... but air conditioning is the norm .
when i first moved out and did n't have that luxurious cool air , i took at least three showers a day and kept a wet rag in my hand to wipe my face and arms ... kind of homemade air conditioning .
good luck to ya 'll .
cyndi walkup , tulsa , ok , usa to be honest , the weather here is quite ok compared to the rest of the world .
but maybe i 'd better think again about whether to invite my grandparents to come here for their holidays next summer .
helen fei , china -lrb- in bolton , england for sixth form education -rrb- i work in an engine room and have seen the temperature on the first ship i sailed with rise to 72 celsius in the far east .
now moan about the uk .
the average temperature in a ships machinery space in warmer countries is 42 degrees c and after a couple of weeks it all seems pretty normal .
just get used to it and enjoy .
mark chisholm , uk it should be a lesson that the world has to be careful with the ozone layer !
mwanzi josephat , tanzania i thought it 's only mwanza -lrb- tanzania -rrb- has been affected with the increasing heat !
we taka shower 4 times or so per day , we put on light clothes though some young girls go beyond that ... light , transparent and short gowns !
it should be a lesson that the world has to be careful with the ozone layer !
mwanzi josephat , tanzania in a weeks time this will all be forgotten and we can all get back to complaining about how cold and wet it is .
john , uk you 're all saying it 's too hot .
as soon as this " heat wave " ends you 'll all be complaining it 's too * cold * !
here in central california it 's often over 120 " f - for weeks on end .
it can be 110 " f in the * shade * .
enjoy the change , and just be glad you 're not * here * .
michael austin , southern california , usa -lrb- ex uk -rrb- moan moan moan .
the only thing that 's really suffered since the -lrb- lovely -rrb- hot weather started has been conversation .
enjoy it while you can and stop whinging andrea , uk can people not see what worrying effects pollution and the inability of anybody , these days , to attempt to recycle the earth 's resources is having on our planet ?
feeling suffocated and constantly yearning for a drink is not my idea of bliss .
and living in britain , it should n't be !
i 'm sure opinions differ in other countries where beautiful forests are turned to ashes with no chance of damage limitation because the climate is so excruciatingly dry .
emma , uk fantastic !
love it !
could live in this every day !
life would be wonderful if it was n't for the pathetic performance of the railways !
arabella , uk i 'm not sure how anyone can say this is glorious .
it 's so hot you ca n't go outside , it 's too hot to be productive at work , and it 's too hot for my young baby .
dom , uk at least the wines of vintage 2003 should be excellent !
carl , france here in the centre of france we have had 10 consecutive days around + 40c .
although france is used to higher temperatures than britain , nobody can remember a summer this bad .
for us in our first year of our plant nursery business , we have certainly been kept busy with the watering - luckily we have a very good and deep well .
for once the weather is the no .
1 topic of conversation here too !
still at least the wines of vintage 2003 should be excellent !
carl , france i 'm working in an office with no air conditioning or fans just old fashioned windows .
the underfloor heating is still on since it 's broken -lrb- apparently - funny how in winter it 's broken then as well , just so it 's off and we all freeze -rrb- .
i 've lost two stone in two weeks - it 's great , though we all do tend to smell a bit pungent now .
s , uk i 've got one thing to say - this country has gone to the dogs .
we spend eight extra hours in the winter sitting in snow on the motorways and we spend five extra hours in the summer sitting on the trains !
what does the future hold for us ?
becky , hants - uk i have some friends who have come to the uk to cool down .
they live in dubai , where the temperature is in the high 40s to 50s .
andy , uk enjoy the great weather but be sure to do what we do here in sunny southern california : wear a hat and sun-screen and drink plenty of water before you are thirsty .
do not drink alcohol or caffeine drinks .
the human body is designed to take-the-heat if you help it .
enjoy !
michael , california , usa i love fine weather but this beyond a joke trisha , wallingford it is too hot ; i ca n't sleep even though i have two fans in the bedroom .
i love fine weather but this beyond a joke .
colleagues in work ask why i ca n't cope as i did live in cyprus for three and half years .
air conditioning , marble floors and sea breezes .
20 degrees lower and i would be comfortable .
trisha , wallingford i love the summer , although i am fair skinned and so can not sunbathe much at all .
i would like it to be a few degrees cooler just to be able to cope better when i am out and about .
we should n't be complaining too much as we do n't get decent weather like this too often .
i much prefer the heat to the cold , cold winter .
tracey , uk i ca n't understand the constant descriptions of extremely hot weather as being " glorious " , " fantastic " , " healthy " -lrb- ! -rrb- and cold winter weather as being the complete opposite .
being a redhead and of a fair complexion this weather is excruciating for me and i resent the notion that i 'm something of a " killjoy " because i do n't enjoy it .
we are not all sun-worshippers - roll on october !
colette , york , england i am absolutely loving the heat - and long may it last !
this last weekend -lrb- when we finally broke the 100 degree barrier -rrb- , i walked 20 miles in the surrey hills on saturday , cycled 60 miles on sunday morning and played football in hyde park on sunday afternoon .
i have developed a nice tan and saved myself a fortune by not having to go to ibiza to have the same amount of fun !
chris , london , uk if you think this heat is wonderful come down to the south-east for a day and see how much you can bear it then !
the problem is that this country is not prepared for such extremes of temperature such as this .
yes , it would be wonderful to go to spain or greece and for the weather to be like this , but there they have air conditioning , swimming pools , white houses with flat roofs and no carpets designed to reflect heat ...
bring on autumn !
anna , england for all those pessimists who are moaning not only about the hot weather , but all the impact of global warming and how we are destroying the earth .
well the earth , together with mother nature will sort out most of the damage we have caused i reckon .
they are great healers .
climatic change was inevitable and if it makes england more tropical ... well bring it on ! ! !
sharon , uk bad weather is when you 're wearing unsuitable clothing randy , uk i cope with hot weather similarly to cold weather .
i adapt to it .
as billy connolly said , there 's no such thing as bad or good weather .
bad weather is when you 're wearing unsuitable clothing .
whatever the weather , accept it , stop moaning and get on with it .
why this constant concern with weather extremes ?
have n't we lived in this country long enough to blow it right off the comments agenda ?
the way some people describe it , it 's as good as someone 's fault that the weather changes .
grow up , you lot .
randy , uk it 's great !
please stop moaning everyone .
of course it 's hot but constantly banging on about it wo n't change it and certainly wo n't help you stay cool !
i 'm sure those carping about the current weather will also be the first to moan when the rain comes back .
lucy , uk oh yes the heat waves great , apart from being stuck in a train carriage with 700 other people for five hours last wednesday , three hours last night and again for two hours this morning in over 100 degrees of heat with no ventilation and no air conditioning .
no i 'm not travelling to scotland every day just trying to get to work and home again .
the infrastructure in this country is a disgrace .
other countries suffer extremes of weather but do not suffer these problems .
no ones ever accountable or to blame .
it 's about time the government stopped playing world power and stopped throwing our money -lrb- taxes -rrb- around abroad and spent it sorting out the diabolical infrastructure in this country , maybe then we could all enjoy the heat wave without fainting .
alan baker , england nudism .
that 's how i 'm coping .
the nude rambler had the right idea - delete the clothing and chill out !
nudism is guaranteed to get a seat -lrb- if not a whole compartment -rrb- to yourself on the commuter trains , too !
nick hing , uk levels of smog have been at unacceptable and dangerous levels alf , cambridge i work as an air quality officer in cambridge - this weather is concerning and is showing a general upward trend of temperatures year on year .
i can not believe there are still people out there claiming it is good for children and fun .
levels of smog -lrb- highly dangerous for children and others alike -rrb- have been at unacceptable and dangerous levels in parts of the county .
what is it going to take to wake up some of the naive public ?
increase in asthma , bronchial problems , skin cancers , smog , nitrogen dioxide , particulates and i have still seen parents allowing children to run around in temps of 36 degrees with no hats on .
wakey wakey !
alf , cambridge , uk i do n't see what people are moaning about .
this weather is great !
it makes me feel good , is very healthy , and has n't lasted too long .
those spouting about global warming do n't know what they 're talking about .
heat waves like this regularly happened throughout the last century and before .
the longest in terms of drought lasted through 1975 to 1976 .
long before it became fashionable to be concerned about co2 emissions .
tom , uk come on everybody sing along ...
" the sun has got his hat on hip hip hooray , the sun has got his hat on and he 's coming out to play ... "
fantastic weather long may it continue !
danny , uk global warming scenarios are making me really worried joan lee , uk i love the sun , hate the dull , grey weather we get in winter ; but these high temperatures are ott .
air conditioning may help comfort but it consumes yet more fossil fuels , worsening global warming .
ever-worse global warming scenarios are making me really worried for my 1 year old nephew 's generation .
thanks , bbc weather people for acknowledging that this heatwave is hard work for some people .
it would really make my day if you could tell me it 's going to cool down in the se and stay cool .
i hear in europe some rivers are drying up .
i am really worried about the same happening here , if they are not replenished by rainfall this winter .
joan lee , uk come on folks this is glorious .
enjoy it while we can it will soon be back to normal .
only question is , why ca n't our transport system cope ?
my trains have been a nightmare for the last 2 weeks .
if so called 3rd world countries can keep there trains running why ca n't we .
i love this weather but having my working day extended by and hour or more is not funny .
it could only happen in england anywhere else and there would be riots !
bill , england every summer i vow that one day , i 'll immigrate to iceland .
maybe one day i will .
this heat wave has certainly reminded me of why i want to head north .
one can dress up warm against the cold , the heat is altogether far harder to deal with .
andrew , british in the netherlands i hope that this weather carries on for at least two more months .
it is good for the children while off school and we all go away to the sun but now we have it here .
it may not be good for some of the old or infirmed but then the rest of us should help them by doing there shopping or gardening .
this is not extreme weather as looking back through history britain was once a tropical area .
we should enjoy it as next year it could rain all summer .
the reporters should stop moaning and just report it as it is and not keep telling us about it being muggy and too hot .
long may it go on and keep people in there home country and not spending abroad .
colin , uk it is evident that the planet is heating up due to human greed and stupidity misha , uk reading these comments i find the level of denial shocking .
what does it take to open people 's eyes ?
we can measure the hole in the ozone layer ; it is evident that the planet is heating up due to human greed and stupidity .
the glaziers are melting and we will pay for this ' nice ' weather by having torrential downpours - antarctica is going to come down on us , you better believe it .
am i the only one who is outraged that we are still relying on fossil fuels and nuclear power when there are so many safe and sustainable alternatives ?
misha , uk how to beat the heat - this works on trains , buses , tubes , cars etc .
get a half litre bottle of water , and freeze it overnight .
take it out of the freezer about an hour before you set off , to give it a chance to melt a bit .
then you can hold it to cool your hands , and sip it to cool your insides .
i had one yesterday and it lasted until just after lunch .
fantastic , and the best bit is the other travellers enviously licking their lips .
jeremy smith , uk the weather is beautiful and very welcome .
unfortunately when you are facing 14 weeks of road works -lrb- bus lane being installed -rrb- and are stuck in traffic on public transport some with heaters still going , it is not funny .
more like torture !
having to face this morning and evening rather takes the enjoyment out of the sunshine .
lynne , uk you 've taken our soaps , rolf harris , clive james and kylie minogue , now you can have some of our australian weather .
enjoy it while it lasts !
ann teak , australia to all those who wish for this heat wave to be over - can i just say you are all mad !
each year we spend hundreds of pounds to get away from the english summer weather but these past couple of weeks have saved me a fortune !
yes it can be uncomfortable but you wo n't hear me moaning about it !
adapt with the weather !
get outdoor tasks done early morning or in the evening !
stay away autumn / winter !
david , england take it easy and keep hydrated richard amos , usa -lrb- ex uk -rrb- here in southern california it might be hot , but we do enjoy air conditioning everywhere .
it must be terrible back home right now .
just take it easy , and keep hydrated .
i do n't believe that once again the rail system is affected by the heat .
i suppose it makes a change from the wrong kind of leaves !
since leaving the uk , i 've lived in ontario , canada -lrb- -30 c -rrb- , and now southern california -lrb- + 40 c -rrb- , and i 've yet to see buckled rail tracks !
richard amos , usa -lrb- ex uk -rrb- i hate this hot weather and wish it would end soon , i do n't know how much longer the kids and i can bear it , we 're already starting to flag with headaches and exhaustion .
we 're going through so much water we could take shares in the water company !
i prefer 23 degrees , cool enough to wear a suit but warm enough to wear something nice and slinky too .
louise carlton , uk i agree with the fact that this sort of weather is delightful when you can appreciate it .
however like many have said , when you work in an office and have no air con it 's an absolute nightmare .
i think companies need to look at this as a serious issue !
vicky , uk to some of the americans who have made comments to the british to quit whining ought to have their hand smacked .
i start my day in an air conditioned home and leave for an air conditioned office .
the usa is set up to handle the high temperatures in the summer .
you ought to hear our whining though when there is an electrical blackout !
so , i can definitely sympathize with your situation over there , and i hope it gets cooler soon for all of you .
donna , usa -lrb- ohio -rrb- it stops me from being able to dash about getting things done and i constantly perspire - yuk !
jayne , uk i can not cope with the heat .
it stops me from being able to dash about getting things done and i constantly perspire - yuk !
however it is still a bit of a pain when the weather keeps harping on about the heat wave and record temps when you live in the north east and it 's freezing and wet !
do n't keep forgetting about us lot up here , we do exist !
jayne , uk although , it sounds quite nice to have such not weather this summer .
underlying this change could mean something is wrong with the environment .
i 've heard that parts of antarctica been melted , being seen floating around southern america !
can you imagine if this goes on for like next year , do n't think that it can be a threat to other parts of the globe .
hearing the forest fires in canada and portugal was quite horrific .
extreme weather will only mean more natural disasters !
yvonne , uk it 's about time we got some warm weather .
just getting out there and enjoying it , drinking lots and ignoring all the people who moan about the weather all the time .
shame it does n't last all summer and shame it 's probably not going to last till autumn . love it .
sergio , uk this weather is fantastic !
what a great summer in the uk at last !
my office is boiling everyday and my bedroom roasting at night , but it 's too hot to be moaning about that !
we brought a paddling pool to cool off after work anyway .
let 's just stop making such a fuss and enjoy the few weeks we 're having because as history shows , it probably is n't going to happen again for another 13 years .
kirsty , uk what heat ?
i thought it was just warming up !
nick james , uk what heat ?
i thought it was just warming up !
trouble is we in britain never get a chance to acclimatise properly - the weather changes too frequently .
the humidity is the killer , because we are n't used to it .
nor the air suffocating pollution .
overseas , buildings , towns and cities are better built and planned for the environment .
oh well .
the price we pay for living in such densely populated chaos , lack of investment and forward planning .
maybe we 'll get it right in time for the next ice-age .
nick james , uk i 'm really enjoying this unusual spell of summer weather .
it would just be nice if our non air conditioned , virtually windowless office was n't 44 degrees at the moment , and we were n't being expected to carry on as if it were 18 degrees .
but outside of work , i love it !
dan , uk i lived in japan for years and they get temperatures like this through july and august .
this and the humidity can be unbearable especially as they still wear suits to work !
but they have a great aircon infrastructure -lrb- even in the subways -rrb- and their railway tracks do n't buckle .
what is it with british railways ?
pathetic !
ben , uk the more of this weather the better tim , kiwi in london i love it !
the more of this weather the better i say .
bring on the sun , enjoy the parks and the pools and the beaches and the ice creams and the cold lagers and the pimms and the warm evenings in the back garden and the bbqs and the smiles on the kiddies faces and the cricket and the flowers and the .. did i mention cold lagers ?
i hate winter ...
tim , kiwi in london without humidity , the uk really does n't feel that hot -lrb- unless using what little public transport is running -rrb- .
in bahrain , the apparent temperature today is a balmy 54c , i.e. 132f .
texans have it easy .
jez , bahrain if you 're finding it too hot just trying storing your clothes in the fridge .
change t-shirts every half hour and you stay cool and fresh all day long .
gets you funny looks in the office , mind , ben , uk i 'm melting and not finding it joyous or refreshing in the least jen , uk -lrb- ex .
usa -rrb- being an american from kentucky , i 'm used to a lot higher temps than what we had in brum on saturday -lrb- 34c -rrb- but , saying that , i 'm also used to having aircon in the house , the car , and every shop , store and office .
being in the uk now , 5 months pregnant , i 'm melting and not finding it joyous or refreshing in the least .
for those who tell us to stop whingeing , try being pregnant without aircon !

tradesmen say they are suffering at the hands of late payers - with one in 20 businesses owed up to £ 50,000 .
the survey , by insurer eagle star , found that more than half of tradesmen across the uk have been left out of pocket by people who refuse to pay .
of 500 workers quizzed by the small business arm of the insurer , two in five said they had suffered a bad experience with a customer , with most involving non-payment of bills - often leading to cash flow problems .
' cowboy customers ' steve wilson , managing director of eagle star small business direct , said : " we see plenty of tv programmes on so-called cowboy builders , but there 's little on how some customers are reluctant to pay up for perfectly good work .
" this can have serious repercussions on any small business , and as tradesmen often pay up-front for contractors and materials , any delay in receiving payment can prove costly . "
a third of those left in arrears said they were owed over £ 5,000 , while 14 % were owned more than £ 20,000 and 7 % facing unpaid bills totalling £ 50,000 .
almost half said some customers had taken more than six months to pay off their debts .
the delayed payments had a knock-on effect , with more than a third of the plumbers , electricians , glaziers , builders and carpenters polled saying they had been forced to work longer hours .

the organisation , which finds volunteers work in developing countries , has lifted its official retirement age to 75 .
the move , which followed an extension of insurance cover , was aimed at tackling a " chronic shortage " of skilled volunteers in several subjects .
vso says the over-70s have a lot to offer in professional skills and experience . "
as long as i still have something to give ... then i want to go back " english language teachers with several years experience under their belt are hard to find , as are people with management and accountancy skills .
some countries , including china , are said to value the experience and talents of older volunteers .
vso 's director of recruitment nick gallagher said : " if you 're over 50 and have the right skills , up-to-date experience and are passed fit and healthy by vso doctors , then there are opportunities available and we want to hear from you . "
vso has found it harder to recruit people over the last few years .

a spokeswoman for mr obasanjo said the border was re-opened at 0500 gmt friday .
the nigerian authorities sealed off the 773kilometre border between the two countries on sunday because of alleged criminal activity across the frontier .
the closure has hit benin 's economy , pushing up the price of fuel and other imports .
the two leaders met thursday in the nigerian border town of badagry to discuss the crisis , which had threatened to damage relations between the countries .
benin 's leader admitted there were problems .
nigerian losses " there are too many criminals operating in nigeria who reside in benin , " he said before the talks .
" i know there are many robberies and attacks near the border . "
the main border crossing into benin is not far from nigeria 's commercial capital , lagos , and it normally seethes with travellers and traders from benin , togo , ghana and beyond .
despite a recent price increase , petrol in nigeria at around 25 us cents a litre is still the cheapest in the region .
large quantities are smuggled over the border into benin , and the nigerian government has vowed to crack down on this black market saying it costs them a fortune .
nigeria has also recently banned imports of a number of goods including sugar and exercise books .
many nigerian traders were going to benin to purchase these goods .
the border closure went against west africa-wide agreements guaranteeing free movement of goods and people within the region .

home users need to protect themselves from attack the news that microsoft is going to start shipping windows xp with its various security features enabled by default should be welcomed , even if it is does not solve the bigger problem .
after all , it still leaves tens of millions of users with an operating system that was set up to make it easy for them to play online games and use e-commerce websites , and at the same time giving virus and worm writers lots of ways to attack their computers .
and that is to say nothing of the windows 98 , nt and 2000 installed base , where security is more a matter of hoping and installing third-party software than using anything provided by microsoft .
but it is a start .
the decision to change the standard installation of xp is a result of this week 's fuss about the msblast worm , which has infected hundreds of thousands of internet-connected computers and continues to cause problems on the net .
this could get significantly worse on saturday when infected computers are programmed to send fake requests to the microsoft website and try to make it inaccessible .
firewall trouble msblast is another embarrassment for microsoft , but it could mark a turning point in how we think about online security .
at last ordinary windows users will have to do something - actually turn off their firewall - if they want to expose themselves to risk .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure .
then it is been left to untrained , unskilled and unaware users to make the changes which limit risks .
few of us , even the technically skilled among us , bother to do this .
and few of us do it all the time .
click here to tell us what you would like bill thompson to write about .
for example , a few weeks ago i was working in an office and wanted to plug my laptop into their network so i could get online .
each time i wanted to do this i had to configure the firewall client on my computer to talk to their server .
one day i noticed there was a wireless network in the office next door that i could connect to a lot more easily .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure bill thompson unfortunately i had disabled my personal firewall in order to work with the office network , and i forgot to turn it back on again when i started piggy-backing on this other , wireless , network .

this was my own stupid fault and i am not blaming anyone else .
it happened because i took the easy path , tried to cut corners with security , and got caught out .
poor understanding the spread of msblast shows clearly that lots of people do the same .
in this case , an update to windows that would have prevented infection has been available for over a month , but users have failed to download or install it .
that , coupled with a poor understanding of how to secure their systems with anti-virus software and firewalls , created the pool of vulnerable computers that msblast has attacked .
so it is not all microsoft 's fault .
as with january 's sql slammer , responsibility should be split between the software developers and the people who fail to keep their systems as safe as they can be .
which is why microsoft 's change of heart over the xp firewall is to be welcomed .
making computers secure will be worth it instead of having a desktop computer which is wide open to the net and all its nasties the first time you turn it on , users will have to decide which applications they want to be able to use the net , and which features they want to enable .
this is already the case with windows server 2003 , the business operating system .
most personal firewalls come set to block everything when they are installed , leaving it up to the user to decide which features to enable and which risks to take .
now the main consumer operating system will do the same .
it will mean that life is a little less convenient , and there are sure to be some people who object to having to wrestle with the firewall configuration , just as there are people who object to wearing seatbelts or crash helmets .
but unlike some security measures at airports which do nothing to enhance passenger safety and simply add to the inconvenience of flying , having a firewall turned on by default could both raise awareness of computer security and stop worms like msblast from finding machines to infect .
now we just need to get to work on writing software that is not so vulnerable to attack in the first place .

home users need to protect themselves from attack the news that microsoft is going to start shipping windows xp with its various security features enabled by default should be welcomed , even if it is does not solve the bigger problem .
after all , it still leaves tens of millions of users with an operating system that was set up to make it easy for them to play online games and use e-commerce websites , and at the same time giving virus and worm writers lots of ways to attack their computers .
and that is to say nothing of the windows 98 , nt and 2000 installed base , where security is more a matter of hoping and installing third-party software than using anything provided by microsoft .
but it is a start .
the decision to change the standard installation of xp is a result of this week 's fuss about the msblast worm , which has infected hundreds of thousands of internet-connected computers and continues to cause problems on the net .
this could get significantly worse on saturday when infected computers are programmed to send fake requests to the microsoft website and try to make it inaccessible .
firewall trouble msblast is another embarrassment for microsoft , but it could mark a turning point in how we think about online security .
at last ordinary windows users will have to do something - actually turn off their firewall - if they want to expose themselves to risk .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure .
then it is been left to untrained , unskilled and unaware users to make the changes which limit risks .
few of us , even the technically skilled among us , bother to do this .
and few of us do it all the time .
click here to tell us what you would like bill thompson to write about .
for example , a few weeks ago i was working in an office and wanted to plug my laptop into their network so i could get online .
each time i wanted to do this i had to configure the firewall client on my computer to talk to their server .
one day i noticed there was a wireless network in the office next door that i could connect to a lot more easily .

home users need to protect themselves from attack the news that microsoft is going to start shipping windows xp with its various security features enabled by default should be welcomed , even if it is does not solve the bigger problem .
after all , it still leaves tens of millions of users with an operating system that was set up to make it easy for them to play online games and use e-commerce websites , and at the same time giving virus and worm writers lots of ways to attack their computers .
and that is to say nothing of the windows 98 , nt and 2000 installed base , where security is more a matter of hoping and installing third-party software than using anything provided by microsoft .
but it is a start .
the decision to change the standard installation of xp is a result of this week 's fuss about the msblast worm , which has infected hundreds of thousands of internet-connected computers and continues to cause problems on the net .
this could get significantly worse on saturday when infected computers are programmed to send fake requests to the microsoft website and try to make it inaccessible .
firewall trouble msblast is another embarrassment for microsoft , but it could mark a turning point in how we think about online security .
at last ordinary windows users will have to do something - actually turn off their firewall - if they want to expose themselves to risk .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure .
then it is been left to untrained , unskilled and unaware users to make the changes which limit risks .
few of us , even the technically skilled among us , bother to do this .
and few of us do it all the time .
click here to tell us what you would like bill thompson to write about .
for example , a few weeks ago i was working in an office and wanted to plug my laptop into their network so i could get online .
each time i wanted to do this i had to configure the firewall client on my computer to talk to their server .
one day i noticed there was a wireless network in the office next door that i could connect to a lot more easily .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure bill thompson unfortunately i had disabled my personal firewall in order to work with the office network , and i forgot to turn it back on again when i started piggy-backing on this other , wireless , network .
the result was that i got infected with the bugbear virus and had to spend a happy hour cleaning my system .
this was my own stupid fault and i am not blaming anyone else .
it happened because i took the easy path , tried to cut corners with security , and got caught out .
poor understanding the spread of msblast shows clearly that lots of people do the same .
in this case , an update to windows that would have prevented infection has been available for over a month , but users have failed to download or install it .
that , coupled with a poor understanding of how to secure their systems with anti-virus software and firewalls , created the pool of vulnerable computers that msblast has attacked .
so it is not all microsoft 's fault .
as with january 's sql slammer , responsibility should be split between the software developers and the people who fail to keep their systems as safe as they can be .
which is why microsoft 's change of heart over the xp firewall is to be welcomed .
making computers secure will be worth it instead of having a desktop computer which is wide open to the net and all its nasties the first time you turn it on , users will have to decide which applications they want to be able to use the net , and which features they want to enable .
this is already the case with windows server 2003 , the business operating system .
most personal firewalls come set to block everything when they are installed , leaving it up to the user to decide which features to enable and which risks to take .
now the main consumer operating system will do the same .
it will mean that life is a little less convenient , and there are sure to be some people who object to having to wrestle with the firewall configuration , just as there are people who object to wearing seatbelts or crash helmets .
but unlike some security measures at airports which do nothing to enhance passenger safety and simply add to the inconvenience of flying , having a firewall turned on by default could both raise awareness of computer security and stop worms like msblast from finding machines to infect .
now we just need to get to work on writing software that is not so vulnerable to attack in the first place .
is it worth giving up the " easy life " to make computers more secure ?
how far do you go to make your surfing safe ?
having been on the internet since 1993 , i have seen these threats grow .
i have had a firewall installed since 1997 and right at this point of time i am seeing an attempt by the latest threat probing my broadband connected network once every three minutes .
i may be an a typical user in not using microsoft products but may i suggest to all the websites using internet explorer specific functions that they are letting business pass them by .
keep to the web standards .
i 'm not trying to be smug behind my firewall protection but in this stage of the internet 's development , you absolutely have to be careful or else you will be involved in someone else 's disgruntled statement against the establishment ian jones , uk i am an software developer and more and more of my time is spent working with the system administrators making sure all the servers i use at work are patched up to the hilt rather than actually developing software to deploy on them .
it 's not just microsoft software either , the apache web server is also being targeted , which covers all the web servers at work now .
i spent a few hours today trying to help my father sort out the msblast nightmare on his pc .
if xp had come with the firewall enabled , he would have been ok .
the embarrassing thing is that i was the one who convinced him to upgrade to windows xp from me , which he did one week ago .
i 've yet to tell him me would n't have got infected .
oliver pyke , london , uk its absolute laziness -lrb- or stupidity -rrb- to switch off -lrb- or not renew -rrb- anti-virus and security software , leaving your machine open to attack .
we lost about two days ' productivity this week at work due to msblast - most of our 1000 or so machines becoming rapidly infected after our main server failed to stop the worm .
this was due to failure by our it support contractor to update the server software patch in time .
all our machines are xp-based .
my 2 xp-based machines at home were , however , a different story .
our kids spend ages on the nest , so i am pretty diligent in preventing viruses and removing spyware etc - usually on a weekly basis .
the message is simple - let microsoft automatically update your windows setup and all will remain well .
of course , this effectively rules out those with pirate copies of the operating system , but so what ?
lets face it , viruses are computer terrorism .
and these days , people should have learned to be vigilant !
david , scotland the last sentence about writing software less vulnerable is the most important .
many attacks use the fact that sloppy programming has left buffers unchecked thus allowing carefully designed code to run on unsuspecting systems .
user stupidity in downloading " look at these naked tennis player " type e-mails will contribute to the problem , but the fact that the underlying pc software is badly written is the real key here .
lee mayhew , england if you were unwilling to install security on your own pc , then many internet features , like e-commerce , would be too unsafe to use .
would you give a credit card number if you thought the server was not secure enough to keep the details secret ?
or how about your personal details , would you like those all over the net ?
we are now in the information age - that information needs to be secure .
and in the worst case , your pc might become useless , due to this worm .
a firewall and an anti-virus software -lrb- both around £ 20 -rrb- are most definitely worth it to stop all that .
richard , uk i use a mac - without internet explorer , but with a personal firewall -lrb- part of mac osx -rrb- and am relatively free from worry .
no microsoft = much less risk .
ted treen , uk i have been using a firewall ever since i built my first pc , guess what , i have never been infected by one of these internet worms. i suggest people go to www.grc.com and take the free security test to see exactly how secure -lrb- or insecure -rrb- their pc is .
then download a firewall accordingly , there are a few good ones about that are free .
rob , uk online security is something that computer users have not taken seriously for far too long and making the computers easy to use is certainly no excuse .
however , a large part of the problem is that microsoft designs too many features to be " cool " rather than secure .
good examples are the " i love you " virus which exploits visual basic functionality in outlook and the office " macro viruses " .
the security and design of windows xp should be closer to that which a user would find in linux , bsd and other unix like operating systems .
daniel snowden , uk the day after i got my broadband connection i went out and bought a hardware firewall that also acted as a router , meaning both mine and my wife 's mac could share the connection .
although i had to learn about the firewall and how to configure it this was a small price to pay -lrb- in both time and money -rrb- in order to protect our computers .
this means that we can leave them permanently connected to the internet in the knowledge that we are reasonably well protected - add in the virus protection software , e-mail scanners and being sensible about cookies and attachments and i think we 're pretty much secure .
go out and learn about this security stuff before someone teaches you a hard and possibly vicious lesson !
andrew , uk at work i run two virus checkers and a personal firewall .
i backup my work every night .
excessive ?
i do n't think so !
while i was working quite happily this week , colleagues were running round repairing the msblast damage !
at home we use a router with a basic firewall for our adsl , and i run anti-virus and a firewall .
again , this is well worth it .
i 'm glad msblast has caused so much damage - i hope it prompts people to be more alert !
paul madley , uk the best personal firewall currently available , zonealarm , is completely free and very easy to use .
it was a piece of cake to install , it loads when the computer starts up -lrb- so i ca n't forget to start it up -rrb- and it allows my normal net use to continue unimpeded .
i have n't given up the " easy life " !
maybe pc suppliers should start installing it as standard when they sell a pc ?

home users need to protect themselves from attack the news that microsoft is going to start shipping windows xp with its various security features enabled by default should be welcomed , even if it is does not solve the bigger problem .
after all , it still leaves tens of millions of users with an operating system that was set up to make it easy for them to play online games and use e-commerce websites , and at the same time giving virus and worm writers lots of ways to attack their computers .
and that is to say nothing of the windows 98 , nt and 2000 installed base , where security is more a matter of hoping and installing third-party software than using anything provided by microsoft .
but it is a start .
the decision to change the standard installation of xp is a result of this week 's fuss about the msblast worm , which has infected hundreds of thousands of internet-connected computers and continues to cause problems on the net .
this could get significantly worse on saturday when infected computers are programmed to send fake requests to the microsoft website and try to make it inaccessible .
firewall trouble msblast is another embarrassment for microsoft , but it could mark a turning point in how we think about online security .
at last ordinary windows users will have to do something - actually turn off their firewall - if they want to expose themselves to risk .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure .
then it is been left to untrained , unskilled and unaware users to make the changes which limit risks .
few of us , even the technically skilled among us , bother to do this .
and few of us do it all the time .
click here to tell us what you would like bill thompson to write about .
for example , a few weeks ago i was working in an office and wanted to plug my laptop into their network so i could get online .
each time i wanted to do this i had to configure the firewall client on my computer to talk to their server .
one day i noticed there was a wireless network in the office next door that i could connect to a lot more easily .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure bill thompson unfortunately i had disabled my personal firewall in order to work with the office network , and i forgot to turn it back on again when i started piggy-backing on this other , wireless , network .
the result was that i got infected with the bugbear virus and had to spend a happy hour cleaning my system .
this was my own stupid fault and i am not blaming anyone else .
it happened because i took the easy path , tried to cut corners with security , and got caught out .
poor understanding the spread of msblast shows clearly that lots of people do the same .
in this case , an update to windows that would have prevented infection has been available for over a month , but users have failed to download or install it .
that , coupled with a poor understanding of how to secure their systems with anti-virus software and firewalls , created the pool of vulnerable computers that msblast has attacked .
so it is not all microsoft 's fault .
as with january 's sql slammer , responsibility should be split between the software developers and the people who fail to keep their systems as safe as they can be .
which is why microsoft 's change of heart over the xp firewall is to be welcomed .
making computers secure will be worth it instead of having a desktop computer which is wide open to the net and all its nasties the first time you turn it on , users will have to decide which applications they want to be able to use the net , and which features they want to enable .
this is already the case with windows server 2003 , the business operating system .
most personal firewalls come set to block everything when they are installed , leaving it up to the user to decide which features to enable and which risks to take .
now the main consumer operating system will do the same .
it will mean that life is a little less convenient , and there are sure to be some people who object to having to wrestle with the firewall configuration , just as there are people who object to wearing seatbelts or crash helmets .
but unlike some security measures at airports which do nothing to enhance passenger safety and simply add to the inconvenience of flying , having a firewall turned on by default could both raise awareness of computer security and stop worms like msblast from finding machines to infect .
now we just need to get to work on writing software that is not so vulnerable to attack in the first place .
is it worth giving up the " easy life " to make computers more secure ?
how far do you go to make your surfing safe ?
having been on the internet since 1993 , i have seen these threats grow .
i have had a firewall installed since 1997 and right at this point of time i am seeing an attempt by the latest threat probing my broadband connected network once every three minutes .
i may be an a typical user in not using microsoft products but may i suggest to all the websites using internet explorer specific functions that they are letting business pass them by .
keep to the web standards .
i 'm not trying to be smug behind my firewall protection but in this stage of the internet 's development , you absolutely have to be careful or else you will be involved in someone else 's disgruntled statement against the establishment ian jones , uk i am an software developer and more and more of my time is spent working with the system administrators making sure all the servers i use at work are patched up to the hilt rather than actually developing software to deploy on them .
it 's not just microsoft software either , the apache web server is also being targeted , which covers all the web servers at work now .
i spent a few hours today trying to help my father sort out the msblast nightmare on his pc .
if xp had come with the firewall enabled , he would have been ok .
the embarrassing thing is that i was the one who convinced him to upgrade to windows xp from me , which he did one week ago .
i 've yet to tell him me would n't have got infected .
oliver pyke , london , uk its absolute laziness -lrb- or stupidity -rrb- to switch off -lrb- or not renew -rrb- anti-virus and security software , leaving your machine open to attack .
we lost about two days ' productivity this week at work due to msblast - most of our 1000 or so machines becoming rapidly infected after our main server failed to stop the worm .
this was due to failure by our it support contractor to update the server software patch in time .
all our machines are xp-based .
my 2 xp-based machines at home were , however , a different story .
our kids spend ages on the nest , so i am pretty diligent in preventing viruses and removing spyware etc - usually on a weekly basis .
the message is simple - let microsoft automatically update your windows setup and all will remain well .
of course , this effectively rules out those with pirate copies of the operating system , but so what ?
lets face it , viruses are computer terrorism .
and these days , people should have learned to be vigilant !

making computers secure will be worth it instead of having a desktop computer which is wide open to the net and all its nasties the first time you turn it on , users will have to decide which applications they want to be able to use the net , and which features they want to enable .
this is already the case with windows server 2003 , the business operating system .
most personal firewalls come set to block everything when they are installed , leaving it up to the user to decide which features to enable and which risks to take .
now the main consumer operating system will do the same .
it will mean that life is a little less convenient , and there are sure to be some people who object to having to wrestle with the firewall configuration , just as there are people who object to wearing seatbelts or crash helmets .
but unlike some security measures at airports which do nothing to enhance passenger safety and simply add to the inconvenience of flying , having a firewall turned on by default could both raise awareness of computer security and stop worms like msblast from finding machines to infect .

home users need to protect themselves from attack the news that microsoft is going to start shipping windows xp with its various security features enabled by default should be welcomed , even if it is does not solve the bigger problem .
after all , it still leaves tens of millions of users with an operating system that was set up to make it easy for them to play online games and use e-commerce websites , and at the same time giving virus and worm writers lots of ways to attack their computers .
and that is to say nothing of the windows 98 , nt and 2000 installed base , where security is more a matter of hoping and installing third-party software than using anything provided by microsoft .
but it is a start .
the decision to change the standard installation of xp is a result of this week 's fuss about the msblast worm , which has infected hundreds of thousands of internet-connected computers and continues to cause problems on the net .
this could get significantly worse on saturday when infected computers are programmed to send fake requests to the microsoft website and try to make it inaccessible .
firewall trouble msblast is another embarrassment for microsoft , but it could mark a turning point in how we think about online security .
at last ordinary windows users will have to do something - actually turn off their firewall - if they want to expose themselves to risk .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure .
then it is been left to untrained , unskilled and unaware users to make the changes which limit risks .
few of us , even the technically skilled among us , bother to do this .
and few of us do it all the time .
click here to tell us what you would like bill thompson to write about .
for example , a few weeks ago i was working in an office and wanted to plug my laptop into their network so i could get online .
each time i wanted to do this i had to configure the firewall client on my computer to talk to their server .
one day i noticed there was a wireless network in the office next door that i could connect to a lot more easily .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure bill thompson unfortunately i had disabled my personal firewall in order to work with the office network , and i forgot to turn it back on again when i started piggy-backing on this other , wireless , network .
the result was that i got infected with the bugbear virus and had to spend a happy hour cleaning my system .
this was my own stupid fault and i am not blaming anyone else .
it happened because i took the easy path , tried to cut corners with security , and got caught out .
poor understanding the spread of msblast shows clearly that lots of people do the same .
in this case , an update to windows that would have prevented infection has been available for over a month , but users have failed to download or install it .
that , coupled with a poor understanding of how to secure their systems with anti-virus software and firewalls , created the pool of vulnerable computers that msblast has attacked .
so it is not all microsoft 's fault .
as with january 's sql slammer , responsibility should be split between the software developers and the people who fail to keep their systems as safe as they can be .
which is why microsoft 's change of heart over the xp firewall is to be welcomed .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- safer computing versus convenience bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 15 august , 2003 , 10:09 gmt 11:09 uk safer computing versus convenience if we want secure computers , we have to give up the easy life , argues technology analyst bill thompson .
the news that microsoft is going to start shipping windows xp with its various security features enabled by default should be welcomed , even if it is does not solve the bigger problem .
after all , it still leaves tens of millions of users with an operating system that was set up to make it easy for them to play online games and use e-commerce websites , and at the same time giving virus and worm writers lots of ways to attack their computers .
and that is to say nothing of the windows 98 , nt and 2000 installed base , where security is more a matter of hoping and installing third-party software than using anything provided by microsoft .
but it is a start .
the decision to change the standard installation of xp is a result of this week 's fuss about the msblast worm , which has infected hundreds of thousands of internet-connected computers and continues to cause problems on the net .
this could get significantly worse on saturday when infected computers are programmed to send fake requests to the microsoft website and try to make it inaccessible .
firewall trouble msblast is another embarrassment for microsoft , but it could mark a turning point in how we think about online security .
at last ordinary windows users will have to do something - actually turn off their firewall - if they want to expose themselves to risk .
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure .
then it is been left to untrained , unskilled and unaware users to make the changes which limit risks .
few of us , even the technically skilled among us , bother to do this .
and few of us do it all the time .
for example , a few weeks ago i was working in an office and wanted to plug my laptop into their network so i could get online .
each time i wanted to do this i had to configure the firewall client on my computer to talk to their server .
one day i noticed there was a wireless network in the office next door that i could connect to a lot more easily . "
so far everyone has been so focused on ease of use and not getting in the way that they have designed and built systems which are intrinsically insecure " bill thompson unfortunately i had disabled my personal firewall in order to work with the office network , and i forgot to turn it back on again when i started piggy-backing on this other , wireless , network .
the result was that i got infected with the bugbear virus and had to spend a happy hour cleaning my system .
this was my own stupid fault and i am not blaming anyone else .
it happened because i took the easy path , tried to cut corners with security , and got caught out .
poor understanding the spread of msblast shows clearly that lots of people do the same .
in this case , an update to windows that would have prevented infection has been available for over a month , but users have failed to download or install it .
that , coupled with a poor understanding of how to secure their systems with anti-virus software and firewalls , created the pool of vulnerable computers that msblast has attacked .
so it is not all microsoft 's fault .
as with january 's sql slammer , responsibility should be split between the software developers and the people who fail to keep their systems as safe as they can be .
which is why microsoft 's change of heart over the xp firewall is to be welcomed .
instead of having a desktop computer which is wide open to the net and all its nasties the first time you turn it on , users will have to decide which applications they want to be able to use the net , and which features they want to enable .
this is already the case with windows server 2003 , the business operating system .
most personal firewalls come set to block everything when they are installed , leaving it up to the user to decide which features to enable and which risks to take .
now the main consumer operating system will do the same .
it will mean that life is a little less convenient , and there are sure to be some people who object to having to wrestle with the firewall configuration , just as there are people who object to wearing seatbelts or crash helmets .
but unlike some security measures at airports which do nothing to enhance passenger safety and simply add to the inconvenience of flying , having a firewall turned on by default could both raise awareness of computer security and stop worms like msblast from finding machines to infect .
now we just need to get to work on writing software that is not so vulnerable to attack in the first place .
is it worth giving up the " easy life " to make computers more secure ?
how far do you go to make your surfing safe ?
having been on the internet since 1993 , i have seen these threats grow .
i have had a firewall installed since 1997 and right at this point of time i am seeing an attempt by the latest threat probing my broadband connected network once every three minutes .
i may be an a typical user in not using microsoft products but may i suggest to all the websites using internet explorer specific functions that they are letting business pass them by .
keep to the web standards .
i 'm not trying to be smug behind my firewall protection but in this stage of the internet 's development , you absolutely have to be careful or else you will be involved in someone else 's disgruntled statement against the establishment ian jones , uk i am an software developer and more and more of my time is spent working with the system administrators making sure all the servers i use at work are patched up to the hilt rather than actually developing software to deploy on them .
it 's not just microsoft software either , the apache web server is also being targeted , which covers all the web servers at work now .
i spent a few hours today trying to help my father sort out the msblast nightmare on his pc .
if xp had come with the firewall enabled , he would have been ok .
the embarrassing thing is that i was the one who convinced him to upgrade to windows xp from me , which he did one week ago .
i 've yet to tell him me would n't have got infected .
oliver pyke , london , uk its absolute laziness -lrb- or stupidity -rrb- to switch off -lrb- or not renew -rrb- anti-virus and security software , leaving your machine open to attack .
we lost about two days ' productivity this week at work due to msblast - most of our 1000 or so machines becoming rapidly infected after our main server failed to stop the worm .
this was due to failure by our it support contractor to update the server software patch in time .
all our machines are xp-based .
my 2 xp-based machines at home were , however , a different story .
our kids spend ages on the nest , so i am pretty diligent in preventing viruses and removing spyware etc - usually on a weekly basis .
the message is simple - let microsoft automatically update your windows setup and all will remain well .
of course , this effectively rules out those with pirate copies of the operating system , but so what ?
lets face it , viruses are computer terrorism .
and these days , people should have learned to be vigilant !
david , scotland the last sentence about writing software less vulnerable is the most important .
many attacks use the fact that sloppy programming has left buffers unchecked thus allowing carefully designed code to run on unsuspecting systems .
user stupidity in downloading " look at these naked tennis player " type e-mails will contribute to the problem , but the fact that the underlying pc software is badly written is the real key here .
lee mayhew , england if you were unwilling to install security on your own pc , then many internet features , like e-commerce , would be too unsafe to use .
would you give a credit card number if you thought the server was not secure enough to keep the details secret ?
or how about your personal details , would you like those all over the net ?
we are now in the information age - that information needs to be secure .
and in the worst case , your pc might become useless , due to this worm .
a firewall and an anti-virus software -lrb- both around £ 20 -rrb- are most definitely worth it to stop all that .
richard , uk i use a mac - without internet explorer , but with a personal firewall -lrb- part of mac osx -rrb- and am relatively free from worry .
no microsoft = much less risk .
ted treen , uk i have been using a firewall ever since i built my first pc , guess what , i have never been infected by one of these internet worms. i suggest people go to www.grc.com and take the free security test to see exactly how secure -lrb- or insecure -rrb- their pc is .
then download a firewall accordingly , there are a few good ones about that are free .
rob , uk online security is something that computer users have not taken seriously for far too long and making the computers easy to use is certainly no excuse .
however , a large part of the problem is that microsoft designs too many features to be " cool " rather than secure .
good examples are the " i love you " virus which exploits visual basic functionality in outlook and the office " macro viruses " .
the security and design of windows xp should be closer to that which a user would find in linux , bsd and other unix like operating systems .
daniel snowden , uk the day after i got my broadband connection i went out and bought a hardware firewall that also acted as a router , meaning both mine and my wife 's mac could share the connection .
although i had to learn about the firewall and how to configure it this was a small price to pay -lrb- in both time and money -rrb- in order to protect our computers .
this means that we can leave them permanently connected to the internet in the knowledge that we are reasonably well protected - add in the virus protection software , e-mail scanners and being sensible about cookies and attachments and i think we 're pretty much secure .
go out and learn about this security stuff before someone teaches you a hard and possibly vicious lesson !
andrew , uk at work i run two virus checkers and a personal firewall .
i backup my work every night .
excessive ?
i do n't think so !
while i was working quite happily this week , colleagues were running round repairing the msblast damage !
at home we use a router with a basic firewall for our adsl , and i run anti-virus and a firewall .
again , this is well worth it .
i 'm glad msblast has caused so much damage - i hope it prompts people to be more alert !
paul madley , uk the best personal firewall currently available , zonealarm , is completely free and very easy to use .
it was a piece of cake to install , it loads when the computer starts up -lrb- so i ca n't forget to start it up -rrb- and it allows my normal net use to continue unimpeded .
i have n't given up the " easy life " !
maybe pc suppliers should start installing it as standard when they sell a pc ?

the government of iceland announced last week it would take 38 minke whales as part of a scientific programme and claimed the animals had become abundant since a moratorium on whaling came into effect in 1986 .
enraged wildlife supporters demonstrated in trafalgar square on friday with a model of a baby minke whale .
environmental campaigners at greenpeace are sending their ship , rainbow warrior , to iceland to highlight their concern .
tony banks , labour mp , joined the protesters and branded iceland 's argument " ridiculous " .
he said : " this is commercial whaling , they are perverting the name of science to slaughter animals .
" the ships are leaving harbour as we speak but we have to register a protest . "
animal welfare charity the rspca said british shoppers should consider boycotting icelandic fish in protest at the country 's decision to resume whaling .
it said there was no justification for iceland 's plans to kill 38 minke whales , for the first stage of a study to see whether they were responsible for falling fish stocks .
' agonising deaths ' the animal charity and the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- said the study would lead to the deaths of 500 animals over the next two years .
at the london protest , spokesman robbie marsland said : " it takes one-and-a-half hours to kill a whale - there is no humane way to do it . "
but iceland 's whaling commissioner , stefan asmundsson , told bbc news online last week that with 43,000 minkes currently in its waters , the " scientific catch " would have no impact on the species ' status .
iceland also claims its harpoons killed whales instantly without suffering .
the rspca said friday 's resumption of hunting would affect waters including those north of scotland , and would involve the use of " exploding grenade harpoons responsible for the agonising deaths of whales " .
bbc news online 's guide to the key species in the whale-hunting debate at-a-glance rspca marine scientific officer laila sadler said : " we are convinced that whales are not responsible for a decline in fish numbers , but what we do know is that whales will suffer . "
gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international , said : " no science justifies the killing of whales .
this is simply an underhand attempt by the icelandic government to resume commercial whaling . "
campaigners at ifaw said they were appealing to iceland for a last-minute move to end what they call a " cruel and senseless " decision .
spokeswoman della green , said : " there is no need to kill whales to find out what they eat ... fish populations began to decline only after the introduction of intensive commercial fishing . "
fish stocks iceland 's whaling commissioner stefan asmundsson said : " it 's obvious to anyone that whales are very big animals and they eat a lot - a lot of fish .
" precisely the effect they are having on fish stocks around iceland , we do n't know .
we need better data . "
now icelandic tourism bosses have stepped into the debate , warning the hunt might damage business .
the minke whales will be the first to be killed by iceland since it suspended hunting in 1989 .
earlier this year , it said it wanted to take 100 minke , 100 sei and 50 fin whales for its study - but then scaled back its plans .
it said the high dependence of iceland 's economy on fishing meant it had to have a better understanding of all the factors that might impact fish stocks - including whales .
