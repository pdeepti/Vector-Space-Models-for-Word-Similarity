the rapidly narrowing time between the discovery of a vulnerability and its exploitation by computer vandals leaves companies little time to react .
some are turning to tools that work like anti-virus scanners and regularly comb networks for vulnerabilities .
if left open these holes could be used as a conduit by malicious hackers or rogue programs seeking to steal data , delete it or wreak other damage .
hidden danger last year more than 4,000 security vulnerabilities were discovered in the popular software packages used by millions of companies to conduct some of their business via the web .
many malicious hackers use automatic tools to patrol the net and find companies doing a bad job of patching their systems against attack .
many firms find it impossible to keep up with the huge number of security updates and have struggled to keep their networks and software free from loopholes .
" haphazard patch management will definitely cost you money , " said brad johnson of security firm trusecure .
the struggle to keep up has meant that many firms have fallen victim to vulnerabilities that have long been known about .
in january 2003 the slammer worm wrought havoc on the net , despite it exploiting a loophole first noticed in may 2002 .
even microsoft had failed to apply the software patch that would have protected it against slammer .
in a bid to keep up with the vulnerabilities some firms are turning to scanning tools that regularly travel the network of their company , interrogating all the machines on it to find out which ones are home to which vulnerabilities . "
our biggest problem is knowing what we do not know " paul simmonds , ici " our biggest problem is knowing what we do not know , " said paul simmonds , director of global information security for chemicals giant ici .
mr simmonds said he was responsible for security across ici 's 330 sites across the world and safeguarding the computers of more than 36,000 users .
one of the biggest problems he faced , said mr simmonds , was simply knowing which versions of what software was in use across ici 's global network .
he said that ici had now started using a scanning tool made by us firm qualys that scans the ici network for loopholes .
before now firms with large networks would only scan for vulnerabilities every quarter or year because of the time it took to carry out a comprehensive survey .
by contrast , said mr simmonds , tools produced by companies such as qualys can be used weekly or daily .
now , he said , ici was able to treat vulnerabilities like viruses and regularly scan to find out if they had to react to the latest security warning .
" we used to be able to update virus definitions once a month , " said mr simmonds , " then it was once a week and now it is within 30 minutes of a new one being detected . "
knowing whether ici had to react quickly or not at all made a big difference said mr simmonds .
" ici is in the business of making chemicals , " he said , " everything else is an overhead . "

the rapidly narrowing time between the discovery of a vulnerability and its exploitation by computer vandals leaves companies little time to react .
some are turning to tools that work like anti-virus scanners and regularly comb networks for vulnerabilities .
if left open these holes could be used as a conduit by malicious hackers or rogue programs seeking to steal data , delete it or wreak other damage .
hidden danger last year more than 4,000 security vulnerabilities were discovered in the popular software packages used by millions of companies to conduct some of their business via the web .
many malicious hackers use automatic tools to patrol the net and find companies doing a bad job of patching their systems against attack .
many firms find it impossible to keep up with the huge number of security updates and have struggled to keep their networks and software free from loopholes .
" haphazard patch management will definitely cost you money , " said brad johnson of security firm trusecure .
the struggle to keep up has meant that many firms have fallen victim to vulnerabilities that have long been known about .
in january 2003 the slammer worm wrought havoc on the net , despite it exploiting a loophole first noticed in may 2002 .
even microsoft had failed to apply the software patch that would have protected it against slammer .
in a bid to keep up with the vulnerabilities some firms are turning to scanning tools that regularly travel the network of their company , interrogating all the machines on it to find out which ones are home to which vulnerabilities .
our biggest problem is knowing what we do not know paul simmonds , ici " our biggest problem is knowing what we do not know , " said paul simmonds , director of global information security for chemicals giant ici .
mr simmonds said he was responsible for security across ici 's 330 sites across the world and safeguarding the computers of more than 36,000 users .
one of the biggest problems he faced , said mr simmonds , was simply knowing which versions of what software was in use across ici 's global network .
he said that ici had now started using a scanning tool made by us firm qualys that scans the ici network for loopholes .
before now firms with large networks would only scan for vulnerabilities every quarter or year because of the time it took to carry out a comprehensive survey .
by contrast , said mr simmonds , tools produced by companies such as qualys can be used weekly or daily .
now , he said , ici was able to treat vulnerabilities like viruses and regularly scan to find out if they had to react to the latest security warning .
" we used to be able to update virus definitions once a month , " said mr simmonds , " then it was once a week and now it is within 30 minutes of a new one being detected . "

prime minister atal behari vajpayee told the indian parliament he would restore full indian diplomatic representation in islamabad .
hours later pakistan announced it would reciprocate .
the threat of war between the two traditional enemies has caused huge concern since an attack on the indian parliament in december 2001 .
the moves were welcomed by us secretary of state colin powell , who congratulated the two countries for taking what he called very promising first steps to peace .
uk foreign secretary jack straw said he hoped they would be the cue to " normalising " relations between india and pakistan , and pledged britain 's continuing support .
pm 's ' last effort ' " it has been decided to appoint a high commissioner to pakistan and to restore civil aviation links on a reciprocal basis , " mr vajpayee said in his parliamentary address .
" we are committed to the improvement of relations with pakistan and are willing to grasp every opportunity for doing so . "
there have been a series of attacks in kashmir recently however , on the possibility of talks to resolve the kashmir dispute , mr vajpayee said that there would be no role for any " third-party " to mediate , a long-standing demand of pakistan .
mr vajpayee , now 78 , said this , his third attempt to settle differences with pakistan , " will be decisive and will be the last in my lifetime " .
in islamabad , pakistani foreign minister khursheed kasuri welcomed the move .
" pakistan wants high commissioner -lrb- ambassador -rrb- relations with india , " he said according to the associated press news agency .
on monday , pakistani prime minister zafarullah jamali used a phone call with mr vajpayee to invite him to islamabad .
the bbc 's sanjeev srivastiva in delhi says mr vajpayee is unlikely to accept that invitation in a hurry , as india-pakistan summit meetings in recent years have failed to take the peace process much forward .
the emphasis this time around seems to be on a more graded and cautious approach , with both delhi and islamabad apparently agreeing on initiating official level discussions first to prepare the ground for a possible meeting of the two prime ministers later this year .
diplomatic standoff dec 2001 : india recalls its envoy after parliament attack may 2002 : pakistan envoy expelled after attack on indian army camp feb 2003 : deputy ambassadors of both countries expelled after a row over kashmiri separatist funding friday 's diplomatic moves mark a dramatic change in atmosphere after a long period of heightened tension that saw the us leading outside attempts to prevent war breaking out .
india reacted with fury after armed gunmen attacked the federal parliament in delhi in december , 2001 .
it blamed the attack on pakistan-based militants it said were supported by the government in islamabad .
pakistan denied the accusation .
the ensuing months saw india deploy huge numbers of troops along their common border , with pakistan responding in kind .
' dismantling infrastructure ' there have been a number of signs recently that india and pakistan are willing to take steps to address their differences , particularly over the kashmir dispute .
have your say if funding from the west to separatists is stopped , the kashmir issue will die varughis john , india send us your comments but mr vajpayee made clear to parliament that he was not withdrawing india 's long-standing demand for the pakistan government to stop allowing militants to infiltrate into indian-administered kashmir .
" we have repeatedly expressed the need to create a conducive atmosphere for a sustained dialogue which necessarily requires an end to cross-border terrorism and the dismantling of its infrastructure , " he said .
pakistan denies giving militants such support .
india and pakistan have fought two of their three wars over kashmir .
