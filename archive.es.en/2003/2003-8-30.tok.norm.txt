a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .

the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .

german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans . after the controversial decision this week to send german peacekeepers to the northern afghan city of kunduz , taking them outside the capital kabul for the first time , german defense minister peter struck went a step further over the weekend .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , the defense minister said he estimated troops would remain in the country for several years .
in december this year , the german parliament is expected to extend germany ’ s afghanistan mandate by a year .
" it the parliament does approve , then german soldiers will possibly support reconstruction efforts in afghanistan for several years , " he said .
afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "
struck : afghan deployment " very dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck the minister -lrb- photo -rrb- added the afghanistan deployment remained " very dangerous " .
he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .
in any case , the deployment of german soldiers to kunduz will have to be approved by the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in isaf germany currently has 2,000 soldiers serving in isaf in afghanistan and 200 more , also under the isaf umbrella , in uzbekistan .
there are also up to 100 german special forces in afghanistan under operation enduring freedom .

a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .

the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .

concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2003 germans outraged over “ florida rolf ” case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an overburdened chancellor schröder plans to tighten welfare rules for germans living abroad .
a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .
" i always paid my taxes , and i lost my father in the war .
i ’ ve done enough for germany , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .
" i always paid my taxes , and i lost my father in the war .
i ’ ve done enough for germany , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans . after the controversial decision this week to send german peacekeepers to the northern afghan city of kunduz , taking them outside the capital kabul for the first time , german defense minister peter struck went a step further over the weekend .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , the defense minister said he estimated troops would remain in the country for several years .
in december this year , the german parliament is expected to extend germany ’ s afghanistan mandate by a year .
" it the parliament does approve , then german soldiers will possibly support reconstruction efforts in afghanistan for several years , " he said .
afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "

he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .
in any case , the deployment of german soldiers to kunduz will have to be approved by the german parliament .

german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans . after the controversial decision this week to send german peacekeepers to the northern afghan city of kunduz , taking them outside the capital kabul for the first time , german defense minister peter struck went a step further over the weekend .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , the defense minister said he estimated troops would remain in the country for several years .
in december this year , the german parliament is expected to extend germany ’ s afghanistan mandate by a year .
" it the parliament does approve , then german soldiers will possibly support reconstruction efforts in afghanistan for several years , " he said .
afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "
struck : afghan deployment " very dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck the minister -lrb- photo -rrb- added the afghanistan deployment remained " very dangerous " .
he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .
in any case , the deployment of german soldiers to kunduz will have to be approved by the german parliament .

a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .

a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .

german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans . after the controversial decision this week to send german peacekeepers to the northern afghan city of kunduz , taking them outside the capital kabul for the first time , german defense minister peter struck went a step further over the weekend .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , the defense minister said he estimated troops would remain in the country for several years .
in december this year , the german parliament is expected to extend germany ’ s afghanistan mandate by a year .
" it the parliament does approve , then german soldiers will possibly support reconstruction efforts in afghanistan for several years , " he said .
afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "
struck : afghan deployment " very dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck the minister -lrb- photo -rrb- added the afghanistan deployment remained " very dangerous " .
he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .
in any case , the deployment of german soldiers to kunduz will have to be approved by the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in isaf germany currently has 2,000 soldiers serving in isaf in afghanistan and 200 more , also under the isaf umbrella , in uzbekistan .
there are also up to 100 german special forces in afghanistan under operation enduring freedom .
the 250 soldiers who will head to kunduz will provide security cover for provincial reconstruction teams , charged with rebuilding infrastructure such as roads , schools and hospitals and training the police and army . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to troop deployment in kunduz reactions to germany 's planned to send military troops to the norther city of kunduz have not all been positive .
some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good .
-lrb- august 28 , 2003 -rrb- schröder backs sending troops to kunduz german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday said he backed sending german troops to the northern afghan city of kunduz .
the expansion of the peacekeeping mission outside of kabul still needs parliamentary approval .
-lrb- august 27 , 2003 -rrb- from kabul to kunduz : german peacekeepers in afghanistan german soldiers deployed in afghanistan could soon face a new risky mission , if the government agrees to recommendations proposed by a german fact-finding team back from the northern city of kunduz .

a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .
" i always paid my taxes , and i lost my father in the war .
i ’ ve done enough for germany , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans . after the controversial decision this week to send german peacekeepers to the northern afghan city of kunduz , taking them outside the capital kabul for the first time , german defense minister peter struck went a step further over the weekend .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , the defense minister said he estimated troops would remain in the country for several years .
in december this year , the german parliament is expected to extend germany ’ s afghanistan mandate by a year .
" it the parliament does approve , then german soldiers will possibly support reconstruction efforts in afghanistan for several years , " he said .
afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "

he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .
in any case , the deployment of german soldiers to kunduz will have to be approved by the german parliament .

a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .

german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans . after the controversial decision this week to send german peacekeepers to the northern afghan city of kunduz , taking them outside the capital kabul for the first time , german defense minister peter struck went a step further over the weekend .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , the defense minister said he estimated troops would remain in the country for several years .
in december this year , the german parliament is expected to extend germany ’ s afghanistan mandate by a year .
" it the parliament does approve , then german soldiers will possibly support reconstruction efforts in afghanistan for several years , " he said .
afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "

he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .
in any case , the deployment of german soldiers to kunduz will have to be approved by the german parliament .

afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "

he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2003 germans outraged over “ florida rolf ” case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an overburdened chancellor schröder plans to tighten welfare rules for germans living abroad .
a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .
" i always paid my taxes , and i lost my father in the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2003 germans outraged over “ florida rolf ” case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an overburdened chancellor schröder plans to tighten welfare rules for germans living abroad .
a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .
" i always paid my taxes , and i lost my father in the war .
i ’ ve done enough for germany , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .
the mass-selling bild newspaper said that a lower saxony court had ruled german welfare officials had to continue paying the full cost of rolf j ’ s beach apartment for another six months .
life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .

german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans . after the controversial decision this week to send german peacekeepers to the northern afghan city of kunduz , taking them outside the capital kabul for the first time , german defense minister peter struck went a step further over the weekend .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , the defense minister said he estimated troops would remain in the country for several years .
in december this year , the german parliament is expected to extend germany ’ s afghanistan mandate by a year .
" it the parliament does approve , then german soldiers will possibly support reconstruction efforts in afghanistan for several years , " he said .
afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "
struck : afghan deployment " very dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck the minister -lrb- photo -rrb- added the afghanistan deployment remained " very dangerous " .
he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .
in any case , the deployment of german soldiers to kunduz will have to be approved by the german parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in isaf germany currently has 2,000 soldiers serving in isaf in afghanistan and 200 more , also under the isaf umbrella , in uzbekistan .
there are also up to 100 german special forces in afghanistan under operation enduring freedom .
the 250 soldiers who will head to kunduz will provide security cover for provincial reconstruction teams , charged with rebuilding infrastructure such as roads , schools and hospitals and training the police and army . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to troop deployment in kunduz reactions to germany 's planned to send military troops to the norther city of kunduz have not all been positive .

life at the beach paid for by welfare media reports revealed that when welfare officials tried to reduce his housing allowance to € 600 -lrb- $ 655.7 -rrb- monthly , down from the current € 875 , rolf j hired a lawyer - paid for by welfare authorities - who convinced the court their client could not find suitable accommodation for € 600 and could suffer depression if forced to move away from his neighborhood .
a psychiatrist also testified that rolf j - dubbed " florida rolf " by the colorful bild daily - might commit suicide if forced to return to germany .
the court then ordered welfare authorities to continue paying his current full rent for another six months , in addition to the € 730 per month in living costs and € 146 for a cleaner on account of rolf j being classified as handicapped .
rolf j ’ s total welfare benefits , it emerged , amounted to almost € 1,900 per month .
politicians call for end to " sweet life under palms " the case has triggered anger in germany , which faces painful social reforms on account of its cash-strapped welfare and health systems and spiraling unemployment .
politicians are now calling for a revamp of the country ’ s generous welfare laws .
bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber said in an interview with bild , that chancellor schröder and his government should completely strike out paragraphs in legal social law , that regulated welfare benefits for germans living abroad .
" that will finally spell the end of a sweet life under palms for florida rolf and others like him at the cost of the taxpayer , " stoiber said .
" i ’ m also in favor that banks , life insurance companies and property offices should give unrestricted information about the personal wealth of welfare recipients , " he said .
german social and health minister ulla schmidt said people had a right to be upset at the rolf j case .
" such court decisions unhinge the sense of justice in germany , " the social democrat told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
this week the minister announced the regulations would be changed as soon as possible .
" social welfare can ’ t be there to finance a good life for germans in florida , " she said .
german media reports said the minister was planning that in future only hospital patients , who can not return to germany on health grounds and germans in foreign imprisonment , can draw welfare from germany .
in addition , schmidt is reportedly making provisions so that those over 70 aren ’ t affected by the planned new regulations .
this week chancellor schröder announced he wanted to use the headline-grabbing case of florida rolf as an occasion to change the existing law .
the florida rolf case is a " really horrible " example of abusing the social system , schröder said in a television interview .
according to the bild , currently 1055 germans in 83 countries receive welfare , which is estimated to cost a total of € 5.5 million .
" i 've done enough for germany " however the present row in germany over the misuse of the welfare system didn ’ t seem to affect the main figure in the eye of the storm .
interviewed by bild , rolf j , who said he was once a millionaire banker , but suffered a breakdown after losing his fortune and wife , remained unruffled .
" i always paid my taxes , and i lost my father in the war .
i ’ ve done enough for germany , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans . after the controversial decision this week to send german peacekeepers to the northern afghan city of kunduz , taking them outside the capital kabul for the first time , german defense minister peter struck went a step further over the weekend .
in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , the defense minister said he estimated troops would remain in the country for several years .
in december this year , the german parliament is expected to extend germany ’ s afghanistan mandate by a year .
" it the parliament does approve , then german soldiers will possibly support reconstruction efforts in afghanistan for several years , " he said .
afghanistan , he said , will be " the focal point for german foreign deployments . "

he said there was no foolproof protection against attacks , but added , " this terror isn ’ t perpetrated by afghans , but rather by the taliban and al qaeda . "
the afghans , struck said , didn ’ t look upon the germans as an occupying force .
at the same time the minister stressed that a larger german peacekeeping force in afghanistan was only possible if german troop presence in the balkans was scaled back .
" we want to end our macedonia mandate early next year and gradually reduce german presence in kosovo and bosnia , " the minister announced .
concern over relevant u.n. mandate struck ’ s comments come at a time when there is growing resistance in the german government against sending about 250 german soldiers to kunduz before the u.n. expands the mandate for the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which currently only operates in and around kabul for security reasons .
both struck and development minister heidemarie wieczorek zeul , back from a one-day visit to kabul , have voiced concern that chancellor schröder could be considering giving the go-ahead for troops without waiting for the u.n. decision .
" a resolution by the u.n. security council is indispensable , " zeul said on friday .
schröder insisted this week that he didn ’ t want german soldiers to go to kunduz under the umbrella of operation enduring freedom , the anti-terror operation run by washington , but rather under the u.n. at the same time the chancellor said the kunduz deployment couldn ’ t wait until the upcoming general examination of the isaf force in december .
" it has become clear that , on the one hand , the extension of the -lrb- peacekeeping -rrb- process makes sense and is necessary to stabilize the central government in afghanistan ; and on the other hand , that it is responsible as far as the security of the soldiers is concerned , " schroeder told reporters earlier this week .
other western nations so far have reluctant in endorsing an expansion of the isaf mission beyond kabul in the face of persistent security concerns .
even within germany , there are worries following the june 7 deaths of four german soldiers in a suicide attack in kabul .
in any case , the deployment of german soldiers to kunduz will have to be approved by the german parliament .

a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws . 64-year-old german rolf j lives in a comfortable miami beach apartment on florida ’ s east coast and spends much of his time strolling the beach near his home .
so far so good .
but a recent report in a german paper that rolf j was living it up in florida at the cost of germany 's overburdened welfare system was too much for some germans to digest .

in early august , an expedition by civil defence experts and russian mountaineers concluded that an earthquake in nearby afghanistan could destroy the natural barrier which holds back lake sarez , in south-eastern tajikistan .
fears have been expressed that the resulting flood could surge down the panj and amu darya rivers , devastating large areas of inhabited land and displacing hundreds of thousands of people .
lake sarez was itself created by a major earthquake in 1911 .
its waters are held back by a natural barrier of rocks and boulders over 500m -lrb- 1640ft -rrb- high .
danger ' overstated ' the subject is high on the agenda as delegates from central asian and international organisations meet in tajikistan this weekend for the dushanbe fresh water conference .
dr sabit negmatullayev , an academic at tajikistan 's national academy of sciences , has told the itar-tass news agency that the risks have been overstated .
" a danger of the barrier 's collapse does exist , since the lake area is seismically active , but the risks are much smaller than scientists earlier believed , " he said .
dr negmatullayev said that research data accumulated over the years showed that the natural dam containing the lake is stable .
lake sarez is estimated to contained 16 million cubic metres of fresh water .
a key issue being discussed at the dushanbe conference is the complex one of how states in central asia can cooperate to share and manage their water resources .
tajikistan might be the poorest country in central asia - but it does have a lot of water .
two of the mightiest rivers in the region rise in the pamir and tian shan , the mountain ranges where tajikistan , kyrgyzstan and china meet .

but the states downstream take a huge amount of water for irrigation , so by the time the amu darya and syr darya rivers get through the desert regions , there is only a trickle to feed the aral sea .
the sea has shrunk to less than one half of its size in 1960 , bringing environmental and economic catastrophe to the surrounding region .
aral sea - once the world 's fourth largest lake upstream , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan depend on their mountain streams to generate electricity .
they barter hydropower in summer for coal and gas in winter from neighbouring states .
if the barter arrangements do not work , kyrgyzstan and tajikistan have to generate hydroelectric power in the winter .
the result is that excess water is sent through the turbines in winter , flooding areas in uzbekistan and kazakhstan .
then there is not enough water left over for irrigation in summer .
experts say that what is needed is for the countries in the region to integrate their power market , rather than operate bilaterally on a barter basis .
another focus of the conference is health and sanitation , a major problem in a region where many people have no access to clean drinking water .

health officials say the decision to change the rules was made on compassionate grounds , and is no admission of wrong doing .
more than 3,000 patients - mainly haemophiliacs - will be offered ex gratia payments .
a campaign to secure compensation has been fought for 20 years - and more than 1,000 patients have already died .
patients who caught hiv in a similar way have been compensated .
the hepatitis payouts , if they match those already agreed in scotland , could mean a maximum of £ 45,000 per patient .
i looked at the history of this issue and decided on compassionate grounds that this is the right thing to do john reid mp , secretary of state for health more than 1,000 patients have so far died from either hiv or hepatitis after catching it through contaminated blood .
mr reid said : " after becoming secretary of state , i looked at the history of this issue and decided on compassionate grounds that this is the right thing to do in this situation .
" i have therefore decided in principle that english hepatitis c sufferers should receive ex-gratia payments from the department of health . "
' disaster ' the president of the haemophilia society , lord alf morris , said : " the contaminated blood disaster is one of the greatest tragedies in the history of the nhs - almost every haemophilia patient treated at the time was infected .
" today 's announcement is a major breakthrough for 20 years of campaigning for recompense .
today 's announcement is a major breakthrough for 20 years of campaigning for recompense lord alf morris , haemophilia society " the society looks forward to working with government on the detail involved in implementation of the scheme . "
successive ministers from 1995 onwards - when the scale of the problem became clear - have rejected calls for compensation for those infected with hepatitis c. scots pressure the campaign has been particularly vocal in scotland , where 500 infected patients have pushed hard for compensation .
the scottish executive promised months ago that sufferers would receive pay-outs of £ 45,000 but none have received cash yet .
first minister malcolm chisholm said that he now expected to move quickly to compensate patients .
the problems date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s , when hiv and hepatitis c contaminated blood passed undetected into products made for haemophiliacs and other patients .
it is reckoned that every haemophiliac receiving regular infusions of blood products during this period was infected with hepatitis c , and many with hiv .
some other patients regularly receiving blood products , or others simply getting a one-off transfusion , were also left infected .
heat treatment of blood to kill the viruses was finally introduced in 1985 .
however , since then , at least 1,000 patients have died .
donated blood is now screened using modern techniques for both hiv and hepatitis viruses .
change of tune karin pappenheim , the chief executive of the haemophilia society , said that it was the change of stance in scotland which had proved the turning point .
" it is devolution that has made the biggest difference .
" we have been lobbying since 1995 and getting nowhere , but last year malcolm chisholm agreed that compensation should be paid in principle , which was a major breakthrough .
" we 've also had a change in health secretary , which has provided the opportunity for a rethink . "
she said that relatives of patients who had already died should also be considered for compensation .

cleveland police is using part of £ 17,000 , confiscated under special powers from a convicted drug dealer , to finance an action against a suspected cannabis dealer .
some £ 2,000 of the seized cash is being used to finance action against the suspected dealer , who was caught with £ 25,000 in cash .
police hope they will be able to apply for that cash to be confiscated - and used to finance more operations against dealers on teesside .
it is one of only a few cases in the north-east of england , where assets have been taken under the proceeds of crime act 2002 .
the act allows for cash over £ 10,000 to be seized if it is thought the money has come from , or is intended for use in crime .
the prosecution followed a raid last year , where the money found was deemed to be profits made from selling heroin and cocaine .
drug dealing profits detective sergeant paul templeman of middlesbrough drug squad said : " we are doing exactly what the government wants - hitting drugs dealers , taking their ill-gotten gains and using it to finance more anti-drugs operations .
" last year 's operation in middlesbrough took out a major player in the area and his drug dealing profits are helping us continue the fight against drug crime .
" ironically criminals are now funding police operations . "
cleveland police have set up a dedicated financial investigation unit , which is committed to asset confiscation and officers are now issued with laminated cards , highlighting key points to consider when dealing with suspects .
officers are trained to look at suspects ' lifestyles and consider if they exceed their means and are financed on the proceeds of crime .
councillor ken walker , chairman of cleveland police authority added : " we have consistently stressed the need to hit criminals where it hurts them most - in their pockets - and it is even more pleasing when their money can be used to continue the fight against the drugs trade . "
