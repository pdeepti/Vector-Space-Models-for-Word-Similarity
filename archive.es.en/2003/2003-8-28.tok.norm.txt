german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .
in several interviews , he urged metall members " to become more political . "

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "
but that judgement will only come after lord hutton and the other members of his inquiry have listened to testimony and sifted through evidence provided by dozens of witnesses from the blair government and kelly 's work and social circles . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough questions for britain 's tony blair on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .

called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .

" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .

blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .

i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "

on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .
the prime minister ’ s political future could lie in his answers to those questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq .

but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .
the prime minister ’ s political future could lie in his answers to those questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq .

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .
germany ’ s pension system is severely burdened by the country ’ s aging population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with women having on average 1.4 children , well below the 2.1 needed to keep the population steady , an increased ratio of retired people to workers will strain the system . demographers have repeatedly warned that without reforms , a massive rise in government spending for pensions and health care will over-burden the government ’ s budget . if implemented in their entirety , the rürup proposals could bring pension payouts down to 40 percent of a person 's gross salary by 2040 from the current 48 percent . “ not a bible ” fearing a backlash , the german government has been hesitant to clearly back the commission ’ s proposals .
earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .
she said the government would “ thoroughly examine ” the proposals and those which were “ necessary and made sense for germany and our social security ” would be implemented . which elements of the rürup report will be realized should become evident by fall .
franz müntefering , the social democrats parliamentary floor leader , said this week that the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens would present new bills for reforms in the pension and health care sectors in october . criticism from the minority the commission was made up of representatives from the public and private sectors , as well as economists and politicians .
but its recommendations were not backed by all of its members . labor leaders led a minority opinion , which is also being handed over in berlin on thursday .
it rejects the proposal to raise the retirement age , saying it is more important to bring up the current average age of 60.5 to 65 . ursula engelen-kefer , deputy leader of the german trade union federation and also a commission member , said she was disappointed by the rürup results .
“ we regret that the chances this commission had were inadequately used and that those issues we were itching to deal with were not sufficiently considered , ” she told german radio on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retire later ?

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .
when it came that old chestnut of tire changing , men were well over the ' can-do ' threshold : 95 percent proudly announced they could change a tire .
for women , although some -lrb- though not all -rrb- driving schools will show german learners the basics of car repair , only 38 percent of female drivers believed they would be able to change a tire without asking for help . not sexist but a high opinion of themselves despite that , the opinion of german citizens on other germans behind the wheel was less than sexist .
57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .
only 21 percent said they believed male drivers were better .
slightly more german men say they use their mobile phones while behind the wheel - 53 percent against 42 percent of women . as far as speed on germany 's famous no-limit highways , males are more likely to push the pedal to the metal .
or at least that 's what german women say .
for them , german males drive more " aggressively , riskily and ruthlessly . " but pushing it to the limits is just something young men need to do to get it out of their system according to the research .
according to axa chief norbert rollinger , once germany 's males reach age 30 , they become " more feminine " behind the wheel .
road accident statistics reveal " both sexes drive just as well as each other , " rollinger continued , speaking to german news agency dpa . regardless of age , the vast majority saw no problem with their behaviour on the roads .
some 93 percent of women and 96 percent of men believed they were " good drivers . "
although in truth around 10,000 lose their lives in road accidents in germany each year .

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .
when it came that old chestnut of tire changing , men were well over the ' can-do ' threshold : 95 percent proudly announced they could change a tire .
for women , although some -lrb- though not all -rrb- driving schools will show german learners the basics of car repair , only 38 percent of female drivers believed they would be able to change a tire without asking for help . not sexist but a high opinion of themselves despite that , the opinion of german citizens on other germans behind the wheel was less than sexist .
57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .
only 21 percent said they believed male drivers were better .
slightly more german men say they use their mobile phones while behind the wheel - 53 percent against 42 percent of women . as far as speed on germany 's famous no-limit highways , males are more likely to push the pedal to the metal .
or at least that 's what german women say .
for them , german males drive more " aggressively , riskily and ruthlessly . " but pushing it to the limits is just something young men need to do to get it out of their system according to the research .
according to axa chief norbert rollinger , once germany 's males reach age 30 , they become " more feminine " behind the wheel .
road accident statistics reveal " both sexes drive just as well as each other , " rollinger continued , speaking to german news agency dpa . regardless of age , the vast majority saw no problem with their behaviour on the roads .
some 93 percent of women and 96 percent of men believed they were " good drivers . "
although in truth around 10,000 lose their lives in road accidents in germany each year .
if that 's the case , remarked anja schweitzer , a researcher with the psychonomics polling institute , " there really should n't be any accidents on germany 's roads .

but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .

the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .
ronald gegenfurtner , heads of peace village international in dinslaken , germany , offered a more historically circumspect take on the bundeswehr engagement .

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "
but that judgement will only come after lord hutton and the other members of his inquiry have listened to testimony and sifted through evidence provided by dozens of witnesses from the blair government and kelly 's work and social circles . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough questions for britain 's tony blair on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .
germany ’ s pension system is severely burdened by the country ’ s aging population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with women having on average 1.4 children , well below the 2.1 needed to keep the population steady , an increased ratio of retired people to workers will strain the system . demographers have repeatedly warned that without reforms , a massive rise in government spending for pensions and health care will over-burden the government ’ s budget . if implemented in their entirety , the rürup proposals could bring pension payouts down to 40 percent of a person 's gross salary by 2040 from the current 48 percent . “ not a bible ” fearing a backlash , the german government has been hesitant to clearly back the commission ’ s proposals .
earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .
she said the government would “ thoroughly examine ” the proposals and those which were “ necessary and made sense for germany and our social security ” would be implemented . which elements of the rürup report will be realized should become evident by fall .
franz müntefering , the social democrats parliamentary floor leader , said this week that the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens would present new bills for reforms in the pension and health care sectors in october . criticism from the minority the commission was made up of representatives from the public and private sectors , as well as economists and politicians .
but its recommendations were not backed by all of its members . labor leaders led a minority opinion , which is also being handed over in berlin on thursday .
it rejects the proposal to raise the retirement age , saying it is more important to bring up the current average age of 60.5 to 65 . ursula engelen-kefer , deputy leader of the german trade union federation and also a commission member , said she was disappointed by the rürup results .

it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .

it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "
but that judgement will only come after lord hutton and the other members of his inquiry have listened to testimony and sifted through evidence provided by dozens of witnesses from the blair government and kelly 's work and social circles . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough questions for britain 's tony blair on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "
but that judgement will only come after lord hutton and the other members of his inquiry have listened to testimony and sifted through evidence provided by dozens of witnesses from the blair government and kelly 's work and social circles . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough questions for britain 's tony blair on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .

the company ’ s management announced on thursday it is forecasting even worse full-year results in the face of unseasonably sluggish travel sales .
during the spring the war in iraq and the sars outbreak led to a sharp decrease in travel bookings in the country , and that trend is continuing this summer .
many analysts believe demand in the sector will remain sluggish for the remainder of the year .
tui expects sales to climb again in 2004 .

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .
when it came that old chestnut of tire changing , men were well over the ' can-do ' threshold : 95 percent proudly announced they could change a tire .
for women , although some -lrb- though not all -rrb- driving schools will show german learners the basics of car repair , only 38 percent of female drivers believed they would be able to change a tire without asking for help . not sexist but a high opinion of themselves despite that , the opinion of german citizens on other germans behind the wheel was less than sexist .
57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .
only 21 percent said they believed male drivers were better .
slightly more german men say they use their mobile phones while behind the wheel - 53 percent against 42 percent of women . as far as speed on germany 's famous no-limit highways , males are more likely to push the pedal to the metal .
or at least that 's what german women say .
for them , german males drive more " aggressively , riskily and ruthlessly . " but pushing it to the limits is just something young men need to do to get it out of their system according to the research .
according to axa chief norbert rollinger , once germany 's males reach age 30 , they become " more feminine " behind the wheel .
road accident statistics reveal " both sexes drive just as well as each other , " rollinger continued , speaking to german news agency dpa . regardless of age , the vast majority saw no problem with their behaviour on the roads .
some 93 percent of women and 96 percent of men believed they were " good drivers . "
although in truth around 10,000 lose their lives in road accidents in germany each year .
if that 's the case , remarked anja schweitzer , a researcher with the psychonomics polling institute , " there really should n't be any accidents on germany 's roads .

on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .
the prime minister ’ s political future could lie in his answers to those questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq .

he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .
when it came that old chestnut of tire changing , men were well over the ' can-do ' threshold : 95 percent proudly announced they could change a tire .
for women , although some -lrb- though not all -rrb- driving schools will show german learners the basics of car repair , only 38 percent of female drivers believed they would be able to change a tire without asking for help . not sexist but a high opinion of themselves despite that , the opinion of german citizens on other germans behind the wheel was less than sexist .
57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .
only 21 percent said they believed male drivers were better .
slightly more german men say they use their mobile phones while behind the wheel - 53 percent against 42 percent of women . as far as speed on germany 's famous no-limit highways , males are more likely to push the pedal to the metal .
or at least that 's what german women say .
for them , german males drive more " aggressively , riskily and ruthlessly . " but pushing it to the limits is just something young men need to do to get it out of their system according to the research .
according to axa chief norbert rollinger , once germany 's males reach age 30 , they become " more feminine " behind the wheel .
road accident statistics reveal " both sexes drive just as well as each other , " rollinger continued , speaking to german news agency dpa . regardless of age , the vast majority saw no problem with their behaviour on the roads .
some 93 percent of women and 96 percent of men believed they were " good drivers . "

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .
in several interviews , he urged metall members " to become more political . "
peters said ig metall was a " bastion against neo-liberalism " and against the " rampant obsession with privatization . "
" we will become more political because the battle against mass employment will become stronger . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more turmoil on the horizon for ig metall ?
with its power struggles and failed strikes barely behind it , germany 's metalworkers and engineering union threatens to spiral into crisis as a wrench is thrown into its upcoming election .

entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .

earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .
ronald gegenfurtner , heads of peace village international in dinslaken , germany , offered a more historically circumspect take on the bundeswehr engagement .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .
ronald gegenfurtner , heads of peace village international in dinslaken , germany , offered a more historically circumspect take on the bundeswehr engagement .
“ if all of the money that has been spent during the past 20 years for military equipment had instead been used for humanitarian aid – community work , for example – we wouldn ’ t have to be dealing with this now . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are polish troops up to the task of leading a peacekeeping mission in iraq ?

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .
ronald gegenfurtner , heads of peace village international in dinslaken , germany , offered a more historically circumspect take on the bundeswehr engagement .
“ if all of the money that has been spent during the past 20 years for military equipment had instead been used for humanitarian aid – community work , for example – we wouldn ’ t have to be dealing with this now . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are polish troops up to the task of leading a peacekeeping mission in iraq ?

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .
when it came that old chestnut of tire changing , men were well over the ' can-do ' threshold : 95 percent proudly announced they could change a tire .
for women , although some -lrb- though not all -rrb- driving schools will show german learners the basics of car repair , only 38 percent of female drivers believed they would be able to change a tire without asking for help . not sexist but a high opinion of themselves despite that , the opinion of german citizens on other germans behind the wheel was less than sexist .
57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .

uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .

among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .

defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .
ronald gegenfurtner , heads of peace village international in dinslaken , germany , offered a more historically circumspect take on the bundeswehr engagement .
“ if all of the money that has been spent during the past 20 years for military equipment had instead been used for humanitarian aid – community work , for example – we wouldn ’ t have to be dealing with this now . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are polish troops up to the task of leading a peacekeeping mission in iraq ?

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .
germany ’ s pension system is severely burdened by the country ’ s aging population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with women having on average 1.4 children , well below the 2.1 needed to keep the population steady , an increased ratio of retired people to workers will strain the system . demographers have repeatedly warned that without reforms , a massive rise in government spending for pensions and health care will over-burden the government ’ s budget . if implemented in their entirety , the rürup proposals could bring pension payouts down to 40 percent of a person 's gross salary by 2040 from the current 48 percent . “ not a bible ” fearing a backlash , the german government has been hesitant to clearly back the commission ’ s proposals .
earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .
she said the government would “ thoroughly examine ” the proposals and those which were “ necessary and made sense for germany and our social security ” would be implemented . which elements of the rürup report will be realized should become evident by fall .
franz müntefering , the social democrats parliamentary floor leader , said this week that the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens would present new bills for reforms in the pension and health care sectors in october . criticism from the minority the commission was made up of representatives from the public and private sectors , as well as economists and politicians .
but its recommendations were not backed by all of its members . labor leaders led a minority opinion , which is also being handed over in berlin on thursday .
it rejects the proposal to raise the retirement age , saying it is more important to bring up the current average age of 60.5 to 65 . ursula engelen-kefer , deputy leader of the german trade union federation and also a commission member , said she was disappointed by the rürup results .
“ we regret that the chances this commission had were inadequately used and that those issues we were itching to deal with were not sufficiently considered , ” she told german radio on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retire later ?

on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .

the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .

it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .
in several interviews , he urged metall members " to become more political . "

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "

blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .

" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .
germany ’ s pension system is severely burdened by the country ’ s aging population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with women having on average 1.4 children , well below the 2.1 needed to keep the population steady , an increased ratio of retired people to workers will strain the system . demographers have repeatedly warned that without reforms , a massive rise in government spending for pensions and health care will over-burden the government ’ s budget . if implemented in their entirety , the rürup proposals could bring pension payouts down to 40 percent of a person 's gross salary by 2040 from the current 48 percent . “ not a bible ” fearing a backlash , the german government has been hesitant to clearly back the commission ’ s proposals .
earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .
she said the government would “ thoroughly examine ” the proposals and those which were “ necessary and made sense for germany and our social security ” would be implemented . which elements of the rürup report will be realized should become evident by fall .
franz müntefering , the social democrats parliamentary floor leader , said this week that the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens would present new bills for reforms in the pension and health care sectors in october . criticism from the minority the commission was made up of representatives from the public and private sectors , as well as economists and politicians .
but its recommendations were not backed by all of its members . labor leaders led a minority opinion , which is also being handed over in berlin on thursday .
it rejects the proposal to raise the retirement age , saying it is more important to bring up the current average age of 60.5 to 65 . ursula engelen-kefer , deputy leader of the german trade union federation and also a commission member , said she was disappointed by the rürup results .
“ we regret that the chances this commission had were inadequately used and that those issues we were itching to deal with were not sufficiently considered , ” she told german radio on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retire later ?

but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .

earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "
but that judgement will only come after lord hutton and the other members of his inquiry have listened to testimony and sifted through evidence provided by dozens of witnesses from the blair government and kelly 's work and social circles . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough questions for britain 's tony blair on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .
when it came that old chestnut of tire changing , men were well over the ' can-do ' threshold : 95 percent proudly announced they could change a tire .
for women , although some -lrb- though not all -rrb- driving schools will show german learners the basics of car repair , only 38 percent of female drivers believed they would be able to change a tire without asking for help . not sexist but a high opinion of themselves despite that , the opinion of german citizens on other germans behind the wheel was less than sexist .
57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .
only 21 percent said they believed male drivers were better .
slightly more german men say they use their mobile phones while behind the wheel - 53 percent against 42 percent of women . as far as speed on germany 's famous no-limit highways , males are more likely to push the pedal to the metal .
or at least that 's what german women say .
for them , german males drive more " aggressively , riskily and ruthlessly . " but pushing it to the limits is just something young men need to do to get it out of their system according to the research .
according to axa chief norbert rollinger , once germany 's males reach age 30 , they become " more feminine " behind the wheel .
road accident statistics reveal " both sexes drive just as well as each other , " rollinger continued , speaking to german news agency dpa . regardless of age , the vast majority saw no problem with their behaviour on the roads .
some 93 percent of women and 96 percent of men believed they were " good drivers . "
although in truth around 10,000 lose their lives in road accidents in germany each year .
if that 's the case , remarked anja schweitzer , a researcher with the psychonomics polling institute , " there really should n't be any accidents on germany 's roads .

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .
in several interviews , he urged metall members " to become more political . "
peters said ig metall was a " bastion against neo-liberalism " and against the " rampant obsession with privatization . "
" we will become more political because the battle against mass employment will become stronger . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more turmoil on the horizon for ig metall ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2003 tough questions for britain 's tony blair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pm faces an unpleasant afternoon at the old bailey .
on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .
the prime minister ’ s political future could lie in his answers to those questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq .

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .

stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2003 tough questions for britain 's tony blair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pm faces an unpleasant afternoon at the old bailey .
on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .

on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .

on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .
the prime minister ’ s political future could lie in his answers to those questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .

after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "

blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .

" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .
in several interviews , he urged metall members " to become more political . "
peters said ig metall was a " bastion against neo-liberalism " and against the " rampant obsession with privatization . "
" we will become more political because the battle against mass employment will become stronger . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more turmoil on the horizon for ig metall ?
with its power struggles and failed strikes barely behind it , germany 's metalworkers and engineering union threatens to spiral into crisis as a wrench is thrown into its upcoming election .

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .

uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .

shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .

on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .
germany ’ s pension system is severely burdened by the country ’ s aging population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with women having on average 1.4 children , well below the 2.1 needed to keep the population steady , an increased ratio of retired people to workers will strain the system . demographers have repeatedly warned that without reforms , a massive rise in government spending for pensions and health care will over-burden the government ’ s budget . if implemented in their entirety , the rürup proposals could bring pension payouts down to 40 percent of a person 's gross salary by 2040 from the current 48 percent . “ not a bible ” fearing a backlash , the german government has been hesitant to clearly back the commission ’ s proposals .
earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .
she said the government would “ thoroughly examine ” the proposals and those which were “ necessary and made sense for germany and our social security ” would be implemented . which elements of the rürup report will be realized should become evident by fall .
franz müntefering , the social democrats parliamentary floor leader , said this week that the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens would present new bills for reforms in the pension and health care sectors in october . criticism from the minority the commission was made up of representatives from the public and private sectors , as well as economists and politicians .
but its recommendations were not backed by all of its members . labor leaders led a minority opinion , which is also being handed over in berlin on thursday .
it rejects the proposal to raise the retirement age , saying it is more important to bring up the current average age of 60.5 to 65 . ursula engelen-kefer , deputy leader of the german trade union federation and also a commission member , said she was disappointed by the rürup results .

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .
when it came that old chestnut of tire changing , men were well over the ' can-do ' threshold : 95 percent proudly announced they could change a tire .
for women , although some -lrb- though not all -rrb- driving schools will show german learners the basics of car repair , only 38 percent of female drivers believed they would be able to change a tire without asking for help . not sexist but a high opinion of themselves despite that , the opinion of german citizens on other germans behind the wheel was less than sexist .
57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .
only 21 percent said they believed male drivers were better .
slightly more german men say they use their mobile phones while behind the wheel - 53 percent against 42 percent of women . as far as speed on germany 's famous no-limit highways , males are more likely to push the pedal to the metal .
or at least that 's what german women say .
for them , german males drive more " aggressively , riskily and ruthlessly . " but pushing it to the limits is just something young men need to do to get it out of their system according to the research .
according to axa chief norbert rollinger , once germany 's males reach age 30 , they become " more feminine " behind the wheel .
road accident statistics reveal " both sexes drive just as well as each other , " rollinger continued , speaking to german news agency dpa . regardless of age , the vast majority saw no problem with their behaviour on the roads .
some 93 percent of women and 96 percent of men believed they were " good drivers . "

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "

when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .

in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .

earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .
she said the government would “ thoroughly examine ” the proposals and those which were “ necessary and made sense for germany and our social security ” would be implemented . which elements of the rürup report will be realized should become evident by fall .
franz müntefering , the social democrats parliamentary floor leader , said this week that the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens would present new bills for reforms in the pension and health care sectors in october . criticism from the minority the commission was made up of representatives from the public and private sectors , as well as economists and politicians .
but its recommendations were not backed by all of its members . labor leaders led a minority opinion , which is also being handed over in berlin on thursday .
it rejects the proposal to raise the retirement age , saying it is more important to bring up the current average age of 60.5 to 65 . ursula engelen-kefer , deputy leader of the german trade union federation and also a commission member , said she was disappointed by the rürup results .

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .
in several interviews , he urged metall members " to become more political . "
peters said ig metall was a " bastion against neo-liberalism " and against the " rampant obsession with privatization . "
" we will become more political because the battle against mass employment will become stronger . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more turmoil on the horizon for ig metall ?

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "
but that judgement will only come after lord hutton and the other members of his inquiry have listened to testimony and sifted through evidence provided by dozens of witnesses from the blair government and kelly 's work and social circles . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough questions for britain 's tony blair on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .

britain 's prime minister on thursday defended his government ’ s role in the naming of the source behind the bbc ’ s story accusing downing street of “ sexing up ” its september iraq weapons dossier . it would be no exaggeration to call thursday one of the toughest day in tony blair 's political career .
called to london 's royal court of justice , he became only the second british prime minister in history to appear before a judicial inquiry .
speaking before the so-called hutton inquiry , tony blair said he would have resigned if his government ’ s iraq dossier had been " sexed up , " as an explosive bbc report alleged .
" this was an absolutely fundamental charge , " the prime minister said , " this was an allegation that we had behaved in a way which , if true , would have merited my resignation . "
investigators had called on blair to answer questions in the probe into the suicide death of former government scientist david kelly .
just days after the defense ministry leaked his name to reporters and he was ordered to testify before two parliamentary foreign affairs committees , kelly ’ s body was found in the woods near his home , his left wrist slashed .
public trust plummets the ensuing scandal has led public trust in blair to plummet and has pitted 10 downing street in a fierce political battle against the british broadcasting corporation , the country ’ s independent public broadcaster .
for weeks now blair has demanded the bbc retract its report .
after alleging in his bbc report that blair had exaggerated the threat of iraqi weapons , reporter andrew gilligan charged in another newspaper that downing street communications chief alastair campbell had personally " sexed up " what was supposed to be an independent intelligence dossier .
but on thursday , blair vigorously denied the charge , saying the claim that saddam hussein could deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes had come from british intelligence .
throughout its drafting , he said , he knew it " had to be a document that was owned by the joint intelligence committee and its chairman . "
in the end , he said , " we described the intelligence in a way that was perfectly justified . "
" the best case we could have " blair also defended the september iraq weapons dossier – and said his government did the best it could under difficult circumstances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the clamor for us to produce evidence was very strong , " he said .
" we had to disclose what we knew because there was an enormous clamor ... it was important it made the best case we could have . "
when kelly came forward to his boss at the defense ministry and confirmed he had been the source , blair said he and his aides were in a " quandary " as to what they should next do .
blair told the inquiry ’ s chief , lord hutton , there was " no way " the government could keep kelly ’ s name confidential after he came forward .
the government then wrote to the two parliamentary committees and disclosed that kelly had been the source .
" i was really not sure what the right way to handle this issue was but i knew that we should not be in a situation where we could be accused of misleading the commons foreign affairs committee , " blair told the inquiry .
deeply unpleasant he acknowledged the troubles that posed for kelly , describing as " deeply unpleasant , " his sudden thrust into the media spotlight .
" it was one of the reasons why we agreed that the press statement should be agreed with dr. kelly , but there was in my view no way of keeping this information private . "
in the end , blair said he was prepared to accept his own responsibility in the scandal : " the responsibility is mine at the end of the day .
i take the decision as prime minister , but i wanted to be able to say that we had played by the book . "

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .
when it came that old chestnut of tire changing , men were well over the ' can-do ' threshold : 95 percent proudly announced they could change a tire .
for women , although some -lrb- though not all -rrb- driving schools will show german learners the basics of car repair , only 38 percent of female drivers believed they would be able to change a tire without asking for help . not sexist but a high opinion of themselves despite that , the opinion of german citizens on other germans behind the wheel was less than sexist .
57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .
only 21 percent said they believed male drivers were better .
slightly more german men say they use their mobile phones while behind the wheel - 53 percent against 42 percent of women . as far as speed on germany 's famous no-limit highways , males are more likely to push the pedal to the metal .
or at least that 's what german women say .
for them , german males drive more " aggressively , riskily and ruthlessly . " but pushing it to the limits is just something young men need to do to get it out of their system according to the research .
according to axa chief norbert rollinger , once germany 's males reach age 30 , they become " more feminine " behind the wheel .
road accident statistics reveal " both sexes drive just as well as each other , " rollinger continued , speaking to german news agency dpa . regardless of age , the vast majority saw no problem with their behaviour on the roads .
some 93 percent of women and 96 percent of men believed they were " good drivers . "
although in truth around 10,000 lose their lives in road accidents in germany each year .
if that 's the case , remarked anja schweitzer , a researcher with the psychonomics polling institute , " there really should n't be any accidents on germany 's roads .

new research reveals germany 's men and women are pretty equal only some of the clichés about german drivers are true according to a new study . good news for misogynists everywhere : almost a third of germany 's women do n't trust themselves to change a car tire .
but not all of the old clichés about the driving abilities of the two sexes are true , according to a new study . the research , carried out by hamburg-based car magazine auto bild and international insurer axa , asked a representative group of 1,000 germans aged between 18 and 65 about their behavior when driving their cars .
and the results were , well , just the ticket for a slow news day . where 's that nice mechanic man ? only 27 percent of german women questioned by researchers admitted they had problems with reverse parking , compared with 15 percent of men .

57 percent of those asked said they believed women were just as good behind the wheel as men .
only 21 percent said they believed male drivers were better .

or at least that 's what german women say .
for them , german males drive more " aggressively , riskily and ruthlessly . " but pushing it to the limits is just something young men need to do to get it out of their system according to the research .
according to axa chief norbert rollinger , once germany 's males reach age 30 , they become " more feminine " behind the wheel .
road accident statistics reveal " both sexes drive just as well as each other , " rollinger continued , speaking to german news agency dpa . regardless of age , the vast majority saw no problem with their behaviour on the roads .
some 93 percent of women and 96 percent of men believed they were " good drivers . "

some warn the soldiers could do more harm than good . reactions from german humanitarian organizations to wednesday 's decision to expand the german military 's mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul have ranged from outright criticism to cautious optimism . fears for stability many , including groups like caritas international , a catholic charity , fear a military presence in areas not currently covered by the international security force already there could actually increase the danger for civilian relief workers trying to provide supplies to afghans .
they also fear it could make them more vulnerable as targets for taliban or al qaeda sympathizers .
the director of the german disaster relief organization diakonie katastrophenhilfe , hannelore hensler , described the expected deployment in the kunduz region as " not a suitable way to bring peace and stability to the country . ”
both caritas international and diakonie katastrophenhilfe have been active in afghanistan since october 2001 . red cross registers support other organizations , including the german red cross , issued statements of support for the decision to station 250 bundeswehr troops in kunduz , located approximately 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- north of kabul .
red cross spokesman frederik barkenhammar said he supported efforts of the german government to strengthen security in the region , but warned that a clear boundaries had to be set between the work done by aid workers and soldiers .
“ aid organizations like us suffer when the military takes on classic humanitarian tasks , ” barkenhammar said .
defense minister peter struck dismissed the criticism from aid groups that the military presence in kunduz could be counterproductive .
he said aid organizations often underestimated the dangers they faced on the ground . " the aid organizations should be thankful that we are there and offer protection , " he told the ard television network .
" in afghanistan there are groups who 'd like nothing more than see them forced out of the country . " kunduz : the wrong choice ? other organizations voiced criticism of the government ’ s decision to send troops to a relatively stable region like kunduz .
uli post , spokesman for the german committee for the fight against hunger , described kunduz as one of the “ most secure ” regions outside kabul , adding that help in other parts of afghanistan was more urgently needed .
stefan recker , who is organizing the group 's efforts to build wells and facilities for distributing clean drinking water , suggested that the bundeswehr instead deploy troops to the many areas that are difficult for groups like his to reach , where the need for drinking water and other necessities is severe .
he points to the ghor province as an example .
long afghanistan ’ s poorest , the region lacks schools , water and any form of basic infrastructure . “ in winter , it snows and the streets turn into muddy pits , ” recker said . contrary to his colleagues at other organizations who have opposed working with the bundeswehr , recker said the army ’ s helicopters and heavy equipment would make it far easier to reach these people than anything civilian groups could come up with .
but how safe is kunduz ?
shelter germany chairman udo stolten said that although the region is relatively secure , the situation could change quickly . “ it can certainly come to conflict quickly if people don ’ t understand the cultural climate , ” warned stolten , whose international parent organization , shelter now , has been operating close to 20 aid projects in afghanistan since 1988 .
ronald gegenfurtner , heads of peace village international in dinslaken , germany , offered a more historically circumspect take on the bundeswehr engagement .
“ if all of the money that has been spent during the past 20 years for military equipment had instead been used for humanitarian aid – community work , for example – we wouldn ’ t have to be dealing with this now . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are polish troops up to the task of leading a peacekeeping mission in iraq ?

a government-backed commission presented its proposals to reform the german pensions system on thursday .
but whether chancellor schröder ’ s center-left coalition will adopt the recommendations is another matter . after nine months of hard , often thankless work , the so-called rürup commission handed over its final report to german health minister ulla schmidt thursday morning .
entrusted with finding a way to revamp germany 's creaky pension system , the 26-member panel of experts has already seen many of its suggestions attacked by politicians of all stripes . as details of the 377-page document leaked out in the past weeks , the head of the commission – economist bert rürup – has come under increasing fire .
among the most controversial proposals is a plan to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2035 . the commission also suggested freezing pension payouts at current levels until 2005 and again any time thereafter if the number of people receiving money exceeded the number of those contributing to the scheme .
but rürup defending the commissions suggestions after officially presenting the report at a press conference in berlin . “ with these proposals – which take account of the interests of both young and old – the financing of social security would be much more justly spread over the generations , ” rürup said . a change is imminent over the past months , rürup faced a difficult task .
germany ’ s pension system is severely burdened by the country ’ s aging population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with women having on average 1.4 children , well below the 2.1 needed to keep the population steady , an increased ratio of retired people to workers will strain the system . demographers have repeatedly warned that without reforms , a massive rise in government spending for pensions and health care will over-burden the government ’ s budget . if implemented in their entirety , the rürup proposals could bring pension payouts down to 40 percent of a person 's gross salary by 2040 from the current 48 percent . “ not a bible ” fearing a backlash , the german government has been hesitant to clearly back the commission ’ s proposals .
earlier this week , chancellor gerhard schröder stressed that they were not binding , saying the document was " not a bible " and that he hoped the " effective retirement age " could be maintained at 65 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister ulla schmidt minister schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- said at the presentation in berlin on thursday that the recommendations would present the basis for reform decisions .
she said the government would “ thoroughly examine ” the proposals and those which were “ necessary and made sense for germany and our social security ” would be implemented . which elements of the rürup report will be realized should become evident by fall .
franz müntefering , the social democrats parliamentary floor leader , said this week that the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens would present new bills for reforms in the pension and health care sectors in october . criticism from the minority the commission was made up of representatives from the public and private sectors , as well as economists and politicians .
but its recommendations were not backed by all of its members . labor leaders led a minority opinion , which is also being handed over in berlin on thursday .
it rejects the proposal to raise the retirement age , saying it is more important to bring up the current average age of 60.5 to 65 . ursula engelen-kefer , deputy leader of the german trade union federation and also a commission member , said she was disappointed by the rürup results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.08.2003 tough questions for britain 's tony blair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pm faces an unpleasant afternoon at the old bailey .
on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .
the prime minister ’ s political future could lie in his answers to those questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq .

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .
although they were able to derail peters ’ candidacy , his deputy is expected to be ig metall ’ s baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , a modernizer who enjoys considerable power in the industry . though the duo is likely to be elected by a large majority of delegates , they will have their hands full from the outset . ig metall losing members and money ig metall , germany ’ s second-largest trade union with 2.56 million members from the metal , engineering , coal , steel industries , has been ailing long before it launched its highly unpopular ill-fated strike this spring in an effort to shorten working hours in eastern germany and bring them in line with those in the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picketers at the headquarters of the german sports car producer porsche ag , stuttgart , may 6 , 2002 but the strike -lrb- photo -rrb- , which crippled automobile production across the country , ended in a humiliating defeat for the union .
it also placed ig metall in an unfavorable light with business , government and the public seeing it as further damaging one of germany ’ s weakest regions at a time of severe economic downturn . the result was that several members turned their back on the union : from around 2.64 million members in january this year , numbers have slipped by 80,000 .
the strike debacle also cost ig metall financially , with the union forced to cut its budget in the current year by ten percent and expecting a deficit of € 8.4 million . the union also faces a tough round of negotiations at the end of the year with employers when they discuss pay increases for workers in the metal and electronic industry .
many believe the union 's failed strike in eastern germany has also strengthened the hand of the employers , who together with conservative and liberal politicians are demanding a modernization of nationwide wage agreements . citizens sceptical of union policies but in addition to the failed strike action , many germans have also been questioning ig metall ’ s policies , in particular its unrelenting criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s planned agenda 2010 – a package of painful social , economic and labor market reforms that foresee among other things , reducing the amount of time that one can draw unemployment benefits . a recent survey commissioned by deutsche welle television reflected the disenchantment felt by germans towards trade unions like ig metall .
seventy-three percent of over 1000 people surveyed said they found the trade union policies outdated out of touch with the times .
sixty-three percent of all germans believed trade union policies led to job losses and even half of all union member surveyed said union policies likely hindered job creation . but such anti-union sentiment apparently leave peters cold .
in the run up to this weekend ’ s vote , peters railed against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 and his social democrats and accused them of abandoning their roots .
in several interviews , he urged metall members " to become more political . "
peters said ig metall was a " bastion against neo-liberalism " and against the " rampant obsession with privatization . "

german engineering trade union ig metall will elect a new leadership this weekend , hoping to end a crippling power struggle after failed strikes this spring .
but is the designated chairman is the right man for the job ? after months of leadership turmoil , a strike debacle and falling membership numbers , germany ’ s once mighty metalworkers and engineering union ig metall hopes to turn a new page this weekend .
it is then that around 600 delegates will gather in frankfurt to elect the union ’ s new leadership and thus take the first steps in guiding the battered organization out of the biggest crisis it in its history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters ig metall ’ s designated chairman , 59-year-old jürgen peters -lrb- photo -rrb- , is widely expected to be elected to the union ’ s top job on sunday .
but many both within and outside the union have their doubts about whether he ’ s the right person to lead ig metall into the future . for peters , a left-wing traditionalist , remains a controversial figure after an ugly dispute over his role in a disastrous strike this spring .
he is blamed for organizing a strike to cut the hours of workers in eastern germany to 35 hours a week at time when unemployment in the region hovers around 18 percent . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany .

on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .

on thursday , tony blair becomes the second ever prime minister to appear before a judicial inquiry .
he 'll be grilled about the suicide of david kelly , who accused downing street of “ sexing up ” an iraq weapons report . tony blair faces a tough line of questioning on thursday before the hutton inquiry , which is looking into the death of the source of a bbc report claiming the government " sexed up " its dossier of evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
his testimony marks only the second time in history that a british prime minister has been forced to appear before a judicial inquiry into government affairs .
the hutton inquiry , led by lord hutton of the royal courts of justice , is seeking to determine whether blair ’ s government acted improperly in naming kelly , who had been an anonymous bbc source .
the contents of the report , however , will prove less important than kelly 's naming , since the government has already admitted the iraqi threat was not what they had originally thought it was .
blair ’ s appearance could be made more difficult following testimony on wednesday by his defense secretary , geoff hoon , who sought to distance himself from decisions taken to release the name of the scientist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geoff hoon while acknowledging that his ministry ’ s press office had revealed david kelly ’ s name to the bbc , hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- said his press officers had worked with officials from the prime minister ’ s office and that he had no part in it .
but hoon said there had been " no conspiracy " in the decision to reveal kelly ’ s name ; nor had there been any cover-up attempt .
political intrigue after his naming , kelly had been forced to testify before two high-ranking parliamentary committees , and hoon conceded that pressure placed on the scientist by the foreign affairs select committee may have contributed to his decision to take his own life .
police found kelly ’ s -lrb- photo -rrb- body near his home on july 18 with a slashed left wrist .
kelly ’ s naming and later suicide launched a national scandal that threatens the future of the blair government .
hoon has also been under fire because it was his decision to order kelly to appear before the committees .
hoon also acknowledged that he had sent a confidential letter to the bbc at the behest of blair ’ s chief of staff , jonathan powell , in an effort to find out whether kelly had been the source of the story .
at the same time , hoon defended his ministry against charges that it had treated kelly " poorly " during the events leading up to his death .
on july 14 , for example , defense ministry personnel director richard hatfield sent kelly a letter accusing him of " ill-judged " meetings with bbc reporter andrew gilligan that were a serious breach of procedure .
in talks with reporters , kelly said he felt he had been put " through the ringer " by the defense ministry .
on the dock , hoon dismissed such claims .
" in fact , he had been very well treated by the personnel director and those in the department , and a great deal of support had been afforded to him , " hoon said .
" i can not see any way in which dr. kelly was poorly treated in the ministry of defense . "
the defense minister said he tried to protect kelly from the media and that he had not seen a memo calling on the ministry ’ s spokesmen to confirm kelly ’ s name if reporters called and identified him .
a prime minister on the dock on thursday , the focus will be on blair , for whom the stakes are highest .
since the outbreak of the scandal , public trust in the british leader has eroded sharply .
four days after kelly ’ s death , blair denied any involvement in the decision to name kelly .
" emphatically not , i did not authorize the leaking of the name of david kelly . "
but testimony and evidence submitted to the hutton inquiry has raised serious doubts about that claim .
already , downing street ’ s security and intelligence coordinator , sir david omand , has admitted that blair accepted his idea of giving kelly ’ s name to the intelligence and security committee without his the scientist ’ s consent , saying kelly had an obligation to testify because of the " very great damage " he had caused the government .
blair will be asked why kelly ’ s name was revealed to the press and what role he played in the decision .
he is also likely to be asked whether his government sought to embellish the weapons dossier to make war more palatable to the british public .
the prime minister ’ s political future could lie in his answers to those questions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq .
-lrb- july 20 , 2003 -rrb- british government exonerated of " sexing up " report a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .
but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence .

rural and urban roads in wales are in a worse condition than those in england or scotland , according to the survey carried out by the institute of civil engineers -lrb- ice -rrb- .
the most severe problems are on roads maintained by councils , and experts are now calling for an independent adviser to tackle the problem in the long-term .
the local transport survey 2003 found the state of 75 % of britain 's roads , footpaths and cycleways deteriorated in the past year .
the government 's 10-year transport plan published in 2000 included a commitment to halt deterioration by 2004 , and eliminate the backlog of repairs by 2010 .
but the bill has gone up every year since . "
local authorities are valiantly struggling to maintain and improve our roads " welsh local government association the ice survey found the poor state of non-trunk roads was made worse because local authorities did not always spend their highway repairs budget on the works .
trunk roads , which are looked after by the welsh assembly in wales , are better maintained .
john sanders , chairman of the ice municipal engineering board , said it was currently up to each local authority to decide " how much of their allocated highways maintenance budget they spend accordingly " .
" in some instances , little more than half is currently used to address the deterioration , " he said .
" we want to see both revenue and capital funding for transport ring-fenced and allocated amounts guaranteed beyond elections . "
the ice also said its planners were frustrated by what it called a " patch and med , sticking plaster " mentality when it comes to keeping the roads up to scratch .
the ice 's local transport survey found britain 's road maintenance backlog amounts to £ 150 for every man , woman and child in the country .
the survey was compiled from research amongst local authorities in great britain with statutory responsibility for roads and pathways .
more than three-quarters of all journeys are made on the types of road covered by the report .
the welsh local government association said local authorities were " valiantly struggling " to maintain and improve roads .
it said the latest reports showed that the funding available in wales was inadequate to deliver all that was expected .
" clearly for the public , the state of their roads and their general environment are often of the same or of even more importance than , say , education and social services , " it said in a statement .

rural and urban roads in wales are in a worse condition than those in england or scotland , according to the survey carried out by the institute of civil engineers -lrb- ice -rrb- .
the most severe problems are on roads maintained by councils , and experts are now calling for an independent adviser to tackle the problem in the long-term .
the local transport survey 2003 found the state of 75 % of britain 's roads , footpaths and cycleways deteriorated in the past year .
the government 's 10-year transport plan published in 2000 included a commitment to halt deterioration by 2004 , and eliminate the backlog of repairs by 2010 .
but the bill has gone up every year since .
local authorities are valiantly struggling to maintain and improve our roads welsh local government association the ice survey found the poor state of non-trunk roads was made worse because local authorities did not always spend their highway repairs budget on the works .
trunk roads , which are looked after by the welsh assembly in wales , are better maintained .
john sanders , chairman of the ice municipal engineering board , said it was currently up to each local authority to decide " how much of their allocated highways maintenance budget they spend accordingly " .
" in some instances , little more than half is currently used to address the deterioration , " he said .
" we want to see both revenue and capital funding for transport ring-fenced and allocated amounts guaranteed beyond elections . "
the ice also said its planners were frustrated by what it called a " patch and med , sticking plaster " mentality when it comes to keeping the roads up to scratch .
the ice 's local transport survey found britain 's road maintenance backlog amounts to £ 150 for every man , woman and child in the country .
the survey was compiled from research amongst local authorities in great britain with statutory responsibility for roads and pathways .
more than three-quarters of all journeys are made on the types of road covered by the report .
the welsh local government association said local authorities were " valiantly struggling " to maintain and improve roads .
it said the latest reports showed that the funding available in wales was inadequate to deliver all that was expected .

experts say the discovery is second in importance only to stonehenge .
the find was made close to the four other existing stone circles at the famous standing stones of callanish , on the isle of lewis .
the discovery of the 30m circle - which is at least 3,000 years old and predates stonehenge - was made by a team of archaeologists from manchester university .
their construction is unusual because instead of being bedded in earth , they are situated on a rocky outcrop and were originally propped up by stones encircling their bases .
because they were propped up when built , the stones have fallen over and some are broken .
colin richards , who led the team , said the discovery was exciting , because it appeared the circle was built on the site of the quarry from which the stones probably originated .
there are not many stone circles in this condition and i have never seen this type of construction used before colin richards , manchester university mr richards , who is senior lecturer in the university 's school of art history and archaeology , has been working on a project for the last two years on the construction of stone circles in the north west of the uk , including orkney and arran .
" there are not many stone circles in this condition and i have never seen this type of construction used before , " he said .
" it was long thought that there may be a further stone circle on the site but , until now , it has lain undiscovered , buried in the peat .
" this is a very exciting find and is not only significant in archaeological terms but also important for the island which benefits from tourism . "
the team has uncovered about half of the stones in the circle and plans to return next year to uncover the rest .

the discovery of the 30m circle - which is at least 3,000 years old and predates stonehenge - was made by a team of archaeologists from manchester university .

us treasury secretary john snow is to travel to beijing next week to express his government 's concern that the yuan may be dangerously undervalued .
on wednesday , the us national association of manufacturers -lrb- nam -rrb- argued that the dollar was 15 % overvalued , and particularly blamed the cheap yuan for causing job losses in american factories .
the yuan is pegged at about 8.3 in the dollar , a rate the nam said was up to 40 % undervalued , giving china 's exporters an unfair advantage and making its imports expensive .
many economists argue that china should allow the yuan to float freely on international markets , or at least should rethink the value of its dollar peg .
money , money , money the obvious sign of the undervaluation of the yuan , say observers , is china 's swelling national accounts .
mr snow faces an anti-china lobby at home the country 's dramatic success in export markets has made it a magnet for foreign currency ; in july alone , its foreign-exchange reserves jumped $ 10bn to almost $ 360bn .
at the same time , the us has started to record a gigantic trade and current-account deficit with regard to china , something that has aroused considerable political anger .
the situation is analagous to the 1980s , when a similar external position with then-booming japan sparked a flurry of complaint .
this time , the problem is more widespread : although china is the biggest target , us manufacturers see most major asian currencies are undervalued .
no complaints here there are few signs that an appeal from mr snow will have any effect in beijing , however .
the yuan has underpinned china 's boom within china , there is little complaint or comment about the exchange rate .
indeed , most chinese firms and policy makers have welcomed the cheap yuan , seeing it as helping to underpin the country 's long economic boom .
despite its increasing involvement in international agencies such as the world trade organisation , china is still reluctant to fall into line on economic policy .

us treasury secretary john snow is to travel to beijing next week to express his government 's concern that the yuan may be dangerously undervalued .
on wednesday , the us national association of manufacturers -lrb- nam -rrb- argued that the dollar was 15 % overvalued , and particularly blamed the cheap yuan for causing job losses in american factories .
the yuan is pegged at about 8.3 in the dollar , a rate the nam said was up to 40 % undervalued , giving china 's exporters an unfair advantage and making its imports expensive .
many economists argue that china should allow the yuan to float freely on international markets , or at least should rethink the value of its dollar peg .
money , money , money the obvious sign of the undervaluation of the yuan , say observers , is china 's swelling national accounts .
mr snow faces an anti-china lobby at home the country 's dramatic success in export markets has made it a magnet for foreign currency ; in july alone , its foreign-exchange reserves jumped $ 10bn to almost $ 360bn .
at the same time , the us has started to record a gigantic trade and current-account deficit with regard to china , something that has aroused considerable political anger .
the situation is analagous to the 1980s , when a similar external position with then-booming japan sparked a flurry of complaint .
this time , the problem is more widespread : although china is the biggest target , us manufacturers see most major asian currencies are undervalued .
no complaints here there are few signs that an appeal from mr snow will have any effect in beijing , however .
the yuan has underpinned china 's boom within china , there is little complaint or comment about the exchange rate .
indeed , most chinese firms and policy makers have welcomed the cheap yuan , seeing it as helping to underpin the country 's long economic boom .
despite its increasing involvement in international agencies such as the world trade organisation , china is still reluctant to fall into line on economic policy .

bbc news online provides a few pointers for dealing with red tape .
okay , so you have your idea .
you 've researched your market , had tentative discussions with potential customers , and set about converting the spare room into an office .
where to begin ?
but how do you actually start a business and keep the men in suits happy ?
one of your first considerations should be whether you wish to form a limited company or operate as a sole trader .
while it is possible to set up a company yourself , you will undoubtedly find it easier to buy an off-the-shelf company or pay a formation agent to ensure you get it right .
it can cost as little as £ 50 .
starting up as a sole trader is much simpler and is perhaps more suitable for lower turnover businesses which will not justify the costs of starting and running a company .
taking responsibility however , one of the main advantages of forming a company is that the company will only have a limited liability for any debts incurred by the business .
although starting a business can be very daunting do n't be afraid to ask for help as a sole trader you are personally responsible for them and can risk losing personal assets - including your home - if you can not meet your debts .
the reality of the situation is rarely quite so straightforward for small companies as banks and creditors will normally demand some form of personal guarantee .
trading through a company can carry substantial tax advantages provided you actually have , or intend to run , a genuine business .
if you 're not , be warned : the inland revenue has recently tightened legislation designed to stop people using a company to effectively disguise their employment and claim the tax breaks aimed at helping small businesses .
tax breaks a company will pay tax on its annual profits -lrb- potentially making up to £ 10,000 a year before handing over a single penny to the taxman ! -rrb- , while you will only be taxed when you take the money out of the company as either a salary or dividends .
it may be tax-efficient to pay yourself dividends depending on your level of earnings , dividends would usually work out as more tax efficient , as they will not attract national insurance contributions .
those with cyclical or erratic revenues might like the idea of being able to use their company as a money box - hanging onto the cash until it is needed to delay their personal tax consequences .
sole traders , meanwhile , are simply taxed on their annual profits and will need to make bi-annual payments to the inland revenue .
accounting rules as soon as you start out as a sole trader you must register yourself as self-employed with the inland revenue and start paying basic national insurance contributions of £ 2 a week .
sole traders good for low return business less start-up costs could lose personal assets if ca n't meet debts pay basic ni contributions simple revenue / expenses accounts suffice failure to do so will pick up a £ 100 fine .
on the downside , companies need to lodge an annual return -lrb- at a cost of £ 15 -rrb- and a set of accounts with companies house each year .
the taxman will also expect a full set of company accounts rather than the simple statement of revenues and expenses he is happy to accept from your sole trading counterparts .
there are some hefty fines for non-compliance but companies house , 0870 3333636 or www.companieshouse.gov.uk , is normally happy to provide basic advice on its requirements .
staffing issues as soon as you employ even just one person you are required by law to take out employers liability insurance .
limited company have limited liability tax advantages file full annual accounts with companies house pay employers liability insurance you must arrange a minimum of £ 5m worth of cover and display your insurance certificate for your employees to see .
fines for failing to comply can be as much as £ 2,500 a day .
sole traders can claim an exemption from this requirement if they only employ members of their family .
as soon as you decide to employ anyone , whether as a trader or a company , you will need to register for paye -lrb- paye as you earn -rrb- .
call the new employer 's helpline on 0845 60 70 143 for a starter pack .
you are legally bound to make tax and national insurance deductions before paying wages and pass the money over to the inland revenue , not forgetting of course the extra national insurance you need to pay as an employer .
calculating your employees ' taxes has become increasingly complicated over the last few years .
depending on who you employ you may need to make deductions for student loans or make payments in respect of sick or maternity leave .
try the paye helpline on 08457 143143 for free advice or visit www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk for a wealth of information and a special area dedicated to employers .
tax calculations as soon as your annual sales look like hitting £ 56,000 you will need to register for vat and start charging your customers an extra 17.5 % .
you must then pay over any tax due to customs & excise on a quarterly basis .
the required form , vat1 , is available on www.hmce.gov.uk or by calling 0845 0109000 .
businesses with a turnover of less than £ 150,000 may benefit from the simplicity of the flat rate scheme which charges a flat rate depending on the type of business you run .
it can save both the time and expense of calculating your tax on the normal input-output basis .

bbc news online provides a few pointers for dealing with red tape .
okay , so you have your idea .
you 've researched your market , had tentative discussions with potential customers , and set about converting the spare room into an office .
where to begin ?
but how do you actually start a business and keep the men in suits happy ?
one of your first considerations should be whether you wish to form a limited company or operate as a sole trader .
while it is possible to set up a company yourself , you will undoubtedly find it easier to buy an off-the-shelf company or pay a formation agent to ensure you get it right .
it can cost as little as £ 50 .
starting up as a sole trader is much simpler and is perhaps more suitable for lower turnover businesses which will not justify the costs of starting and running a company .
taking responsibility however , one of the main advantages of forming a company is that the company will only have a limited liability for any debts incurred by the business .
although starting a business can be very daunting do n't be afraid to ask for help as a sole trader you are personally responsible for them and can risk losing personal assets - including your home - if you can not meet your debts .
the reality of the situation is rarely quite so straightforward for small companies as banks and creditors will normally demand some form of personal guarantee .
trading through a company can carry substantial tax advantages provided you actually have , or intend to run , a genuine business .
if you 're not , be warned : the inland revenue has recently tightened legislation designed to stop people using a company to effectively disguise their employment and claim the tax breaks aimed at helping small businesses .
tax breaks a company will pay tax on its annual profits -lrb- potentially making up to £ 10,000 a year before handing over a single penny to the taxman ! -rrb- , while you will only be taxed when you take the money out of the company as either a salary or dividends .
it may be tax-efficient to pay yourself dividends depending on your level of earnings , dividends would usually work out as more tax efficient , as they will not attract national insurance contributions .
those with cyclical or erratic revenues might like the idea of being able to use their company as a money box - hanging onto the cash until it is needed to delay their personal tax consequences .
sole traders , meanwhile , are simply taxed on their annual profits and will need to make bi-annual payments to the inland revenue .
accounting rules as soon as you start out as a sole trader you must register yourself as self-employed with the inland revenue and start paying basic national insurance contributions of £ 2 a week .
sole traders good for low return business less start-up costs could lose personal assets if ca n't meet debts pay basic ni contributions simple revenue / expenses accounts suffice failure to do so will pick up a £ 100 fine .
on the downside , companies need to lodge an annual return -lrb- at a cost of £ 15 -rrb- and a set of accounts with companies house each year .
the taxman will also expect a full set of company accounts rather than the simple statement of revenues and expenses he is happy to accept from your sole trading counterparts .
there are some hefty fines for non-compliance but companies house , 0870 3333636 or www.companieshouse.gov.uk , is normally happy to provide basic advice on its requirements .
staffing issues as soon as you employ even just one person you are required by law to take out employers liability insurance .
limited company have limited liability tax advantages file full annual accounts with companies house pay employers liability insurance you must arrange a minimum of £ 5m worth of cover and display your insurance certificate for your employees to see .
fines for failing to comply can be as much as £ 2,500 a day .
sole traders can claim an exemption from this requirement if they only employ members of their family .
as soon as you decide to employ anyone , whether as a trader or a company , you will need to register for paye -lrb- paye as you earn -rrb- .
call the new employer 's helpline on 0845 60 70 143 for a starter pack .
you are legally bound to make tax and national insurance deductions before paying wages and pass the money over to the inland revenue , not forgetting of course the extra national insurance you need to pay as an employer .
calculating your employees ' taxes has become increasingly complicated over the last few years .
depending on who you employ you may need to make deductions for student loans or make payments in respect of sick or maternity leave .
try the paye helpline on 08457 143143 for free advice or visit www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk for a wealth of information and a special area dedicated to employers .
tax calculations as soon as your annual sales look like hitting £ 56,000 you will need to register for vat and start charging your customers an extra 17.5 % .
you must then pay over any tax due to customs & excise on a quarterly basis .
the required form , vat1 , is available on www.hmce.gov.uk or by calling 0845 0109000 .
businesses with a turnover of less than £ 150,000 may benefit from the simplicity of the flat rate scheme which charges a flat rate depending on the type of business you run .
it can save both the time and expense of calculating your tax on the normal input-output basis .
although starting a business can be very daunting do n't be afraid to ask for help .
you could also try business link -lrb- 0845 6009006 or www.businesslink.org -rrb- for a wide range of practical advice on setting up and running a business .

the claim from jimmy jackson comes with the release of a report which says seaside towns need to change their architectural design and image in order to bring in more visitors .
in the late 1960s trips to the coast accounted for 75 % of all domestic holidays .
the last 25 years has seen a drop in people staying at the english seaside from 32m to 22m .
the report from the commission for architecture and the built environment says high quality buildings and open spaces can have a big impact on the ways that historic seaside resorts are developing , changing and re-inventing themselves .
but jimmy jackson , who runs the winter gardens in cleethorpes , says the resort is already doing that and is being brought up to date with changes to its skyline such as new luxury apartment blocks on the seafront .
art deco style mr jackson said a development in the town was following a well-received architectural move in one united states holiday destination to incorporate the 1930s art deco style of building design .
he told bbc news online : " basically what is going on in cleethorpes is pretty simple .
it 's not only along the front , we 've got a new cinema coming on our development site which will be in art deco style .
" if you look along the front in miami in florida much of their frontage is art deco .
there 's now an activity feeling in cleethorpes , things are happening and we 're ahead of other traditional resorts . "
the winter gardens itself is being sold in a deal to transform it into luxury apartments and a new cinema is planned for next year .

the claim from jimmy jackson comes with the release of a report which says seaside towns need to change their architectural design and image in order to bring in more visitors .
in the late 1960s trips to the coast accounted for 75 % of all domestic holidays .
the last 25 years has seen a drop in people staying at the english seaside from 32m to 22m .
the report from the commission for architecture and the built environment says high quality buildings and open spaces can have a big impact on the ways that historic seaside resorts are developing , changing and re-inventing themselves .
but jimmy jackson , who runs the winter gardens in cleethorpes , says the resort is already doing that and is being brought up to date with changes to its skyline such as new luxury apartment blocks on the seafront .
art deco style mr jackson said a development in the town was following a well-received architectural move in one united states holiday destination to incorporate the 1930s art deco style of building design .
he told bbc news online : " basically what is going on in cleethorpes is pretty simple .
it 's not only along the front , we 've got a new cinema coming on our development site which will be in art deco style .
" if you look along the front in miami in florida much of their frontage is art deco .
there 's now an activity feeling in cleethorpes , things are happening and we 're ahead of other traditional resorts . "
the winter gardens itself is being sold in a deal to transform it into luxury apartments and a new cinema is planned for next year .

the last 25 years has seen a drop in people staying at the english seaside from 32m to 22m .
the report from the commission for architecture and the built environment says high quality buildings and open spaces can have a big impact on the ways that historic seaside resorts are developing , changing and re-inventing themselves .

according to the us treasury , the london-based palestinian relief and development fund - known as interpal - " has been a principal charity utilised to hide the flow of money to hamas " .
in a statement , the charity commission said the formal investigation it has opened was in response to the allegations of links to the " political / militant activities " of hamas .
" we have taken this step in the best interests of the charity and its beneficiaries and to enable the charity to continue its charitable work under the supervision of the commission , " it said .
the charity will still have access to its money to fund its work , but only with the commission 's explicit approval , a spokesman told bbc news online .
interpal - which raises £ 2m-3m a year for relief efforts in gaza , the west bank , lebanon and jordan - will keep carrying out its projects despite the freeze , its chairman ibrahim hewitt told bbc news online on tuesday .
" we 've been told this is for our own protection , so that any money going through ca n't be hijacked along the way , " mr hewitt said .
" but i think it 's very disappointing , given that the charity commission have been in regular touch with us very recently .
" we do n't have anything to do with hamas . "
the decision amounted to " political interference " in the commission 's work , with washington dc " calling the shots " , he said .
wider ban hamas operates both a political and military wing , and to date european union countries have been at pains to block funds going to the military operations only .
over much of the occupied territories , groups such as hamas are key providers of health and education services .
but the us - encouraged by israel following a deadly bus bombing claimed by hamas - last week said it was banning five groups , four of them europe-based , which funded hamas 's political and social activities .
they also acted as cover for terrorist financing , us treasury officials said .
accusations that islamic non-governmental organisations are being used - often unwittingly - as conduits for terrorist financing are increasingly common in washington dc .
the uk is now believed to be planning to push for its european partners to follow suit and ban hamas - as well as other organisations such as islamic jihad - outright .
the issue is expected to be discussed by european union foreign ministers at a meeting in italy on 5 september .
israel has been pressing for action against certain palestinian charities for a long time , arguing that there is no distinction between political and military wings .
israeli officials told news online that documents found in a raid in ramallah recently indicated that interpal provided eight per cent of hamas funds in the west bank and gaza .
