program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.11.2003 chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of chinese tourists visiting germany is on the rise .
since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .
german hoteliers have some adapting to do to cater for their new guests , but brettschneider believes they will rise to the challenge because it is quite clearly a massive growth market for them . a growing trend at the moment chinese citizens are not allowed to travel to europe alone unless they have a personal invitation and are granted a visa from germany .
germany is the first large european country to which groups of chinese tourists are allowed to travel to .
but that is set to change next year , when a whole host of other european union nations will open their borders to groups of chinese tourists . and although that could take the emphasis off germany as the eager tourists head off to see the sights of other continental countries , most in germany ’ s tourist industry are confident there are enough chinese tourists to go around for everyone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de light at the end of the tunnel for tourism industry ?

since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.11.2003 germany 's reform by committee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s reform agenda could be stymied by the opposition .
the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of chancellor schröder ’ s key welfare and economic reforms will be decided in a committee . german politicians like to proudly tell their european counterparts about the advantages that germany ’ s federal political system has over other more centralized forms of government .
alongside the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , 16 federal states , or länder , are represented by an upper house known as the bundesrat . while such a federal structure has served the country well over the past half century , it can also lead to political gridlock if both houses aren ’ t controlled by the same parties .
that ’ s currently the case and , much to the chagrin of chancellor gerhard schröder , it means the conservative opposition could torpedo his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , a package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . that ’ s because over the years , the bundesrat has gained more scope to veto legislation .
when west germany ’ s constitution was written 54 years ago , the upper chamber had to be consulted on only around 10 percent of federal legislation .
now , however , that figure has soared to almost 60 percent , increasing the importance of a mediation committee made up of 32 representatives from both houses of parliament . reforms at stake schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts last month in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them two weeks ago .
that set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . in order to have the legislation become law by january 1 next year , the mediators will have to make the most of four meetings scheduled to take place through early december .

the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of chancellor schröder ’ s key welfare and economic reforms will be decided in a committee . german politicians like to proudly tell their european counterparts about the advantages that germany ’ s federal political system has over other more centralized forms of government .
alongside the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , 16 federal states , or länder , are represented by an upper house known as the bundesrat . while such a federal structure has served the country well over the past half century , it can also lead to political gridlock if both houses aren ’ t controlled by the same parties .
that ’ s currently the case and , much to the chagrin of chancellor gerhard schröder , it means the conservative opposition could torpedo his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , a package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . that ’ s because over the years , the bundesrat has gained more scope to veto legislation .
when west germany ’ s constitution was written 54 years ago , the upper chamber had to be consulted on only around 10 percent of federal legislation .
now , however , that figure has soared to almost 60 percent , increasing the importance of a mediation committee made up of 32 representatives from both houses of parliament . reforms at stake schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts last month in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them two weeks ago .
that set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . in order to have the legislation become law by january 1 next year , the mediators will have to make the most of four meetings scheduled to take place through early december .

the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of chancellor schröder ’ s key welfare and economic reforms will be decided in a committee . german politicians like to proudly tell their european counterparts about the advantages that germany ’ s federal political system has over other more centralized forms of government .
alongside the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , 16 federal states , or länder , are represented by an upper house known as the bundesrat . while such a federal structure has served the country well over the past half century , it can also lead to political gridlock if both houses aren ’ t controlled by the same parties .
that ’ s currently the case and , much to the chagrin of chancellor gerhard schröder , it means the conservative opposition could torpedo his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” , a package of sweeping reforms designed to spark growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state . that ’ s because over the years , the bundesrat has gained more scope to veto legislation .

“ when mr. hohmann is interested in working with our party , then he knows where he can reach me , ” mario mettbach , the schill party ’ s national chairman , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
were hohmann to take mettbach up on his offer , he would be the schill party ’ s first member of parliament .
the right-wing party is currently part of the hamburg city government .
despite sizable internal resistance , the christian democrats ’ bundestag group ejected hohmann last week for calling jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a speech in october . more briefs 14.11.2003 -pipe- berlin gets new christmas tree 14.11.2003 -pipe- bundestag approves mandate for anti-terror operation 14.11.2003 -pipe- yemeni terror suspects face extradition to u.s. 14.11.2003 -pipe- court rejects first german tobacco case 13.11.2003 -pipe- price hike in 2004 for german beer 13.11.2003 -pipe- hohmann asks for forgiveness for remarks 12.11.2003 -pipe- germany pledges winter aid for afghan refugees 12.11.2003 -pipe- norway ’ s royals consider german legal action radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

france thrashed germany ’ s national soccer team on saturday night 3-0 .
the french squad led by star midfielder zinedine zidane dominated the match despite the germans ’ home field advantage . the germans played a spirited first half in gelsenkirchen near dortmund , but were quickly outclassed by a french side including zidane and number of other leading european club players .
the german team , made up of less experienced younger players , were humbled in front of the home crowd of over 50,000 . “ i ’ m speechless , that was a catastrophic match for us .
we had planned to do so much .
i ’ m sorry for all the fans , ” said stuttgart ’ s 21 year-old rising star andreas hinkel .
“ they play together and know where they need to run .
we have to learn how to play together and come out as a team .
after the 0-2 we just fell apart . ” german national coach rudi völler lamented the fact that his team had once again failed to win against one of the so-called great soccer nations .
despite becoming runner-up at the 2002 world cup , germany has suffered defeats by argentina , brazil , england italy , the netherlands and france in recent years . “ after 60 minutes we gave up , we played with same trepidation against france like we did a few years ago .
that really bothered me , ” said völler .
he also defended german midfielder michael ballack , whose performance paled in comparison to zidane ’ s .
“ you can ’ t compare these two players .
zidane is the magician , ballack the finisher . ” no hope for kahn building on impressive creative playmaking from zidane , it only took 21 minutes for french striker thierry henry to put the ball past german goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn .
france ’ s other star forward david trezeguet then nailed the coffin shut with two goals in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler “ every mistake against such teams will be punished without mercy .
however , we knew beforehand that players like henry , zidane , pirez and trezeguet can never be completely neutralized , ” said völler . the decisive victory on german soil showed france is gearing up to mount a strong defense of their european championship title next summer in portugal .
the squad of french coach jacques santini has now chalked up 13 straight victories , a new national record . during the match , the french players showed confidence proving they had put the unceremoniously early exit at the last world cup behind them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.11.2003 chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of chinese tourists visiting germany is on the rise .
since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .

france thrashed germany ’ s national soccer team on saturday night 3-0 .
the french squad led by star midfielder zinedine zidane dominated the match despite the germans ’ home field advantage . the germans played a spirited first half in gelsenkirchen near dortmund , but were quickly outclassed by a french side including zidane and number of other leading european club players .
the german team , made up of less experienced younger players , were humbled in front of the home crowd of over 50,000 . “ i ’ m speechless , that was a catastrophic match for us .
we had planned to do so much .
i ’ m sorry for all the fans , ” said stuttgart ’ s 21 year-old rising star andreas hinkel .
“ they play together and know where they need to run .
we have to learn how to play together and come out as a team .
after the 0-2 we just fell apart . ” german national coach rudi völler lamented the fact that his team had once again failed to win against one of the so-called great soccer nations .
despite becoming runner-up at the 2002 world cup , germany has suffered defeats by argentina , brazil , england italy , the netherlands and france in recent years . “ after 60 minutes we gave up , we played with same trepidation against france like we did a few years ago .
that really bothered me , ” said völler .
he also defended german midfielder michael ballack , whose performance paled in comparison to zidane ’ s .
“ you can ’ t compare these two players .
zidane is the magician , ballack the finisher . ” no hope for kahn building on impressive creative playmaking from zidane , it only took 21 minutes for french striker thierry henry to put the ball past german goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn .
france ’ s other star forward david trezeguet then nailed the coffin shut with two goals in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler “ every mistake against such teams will be punished without mercy .
however , we knew beforehand that players like henry , zidane , pirez and trezeguet can never be completely neutralized , ” said völler . the decisive victory on german soil showed france is gearing up to mount a strong defense of their european championship title next summer in portugal .
the squad of french coach jacques santini has now chalked up 13 straight victories , a new national record . during the match , the french players showed confidence proving they had put the unceremoniously early exit at the last world cup behind them .
afterwards , they calmly detailed what had unfortunately for völler and team amounted to walk in the park . “ it ’ s nice to win in germany .
we ’ re very pleased , ” said zidane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a patchwork soccer pitch for germany a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.11.2003 chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of chinese tourists visiting germany is on the rise .
since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .
german hoteliers have some adapting to do to cater for their new guests , but brettschneider believes they will rise to the challenge because it is quite clearly a massive growth market for them . a growing trend at the moment chinese citizens are not allowed to travel to europe alone unless they have a personal invitation and are granted a visa from germany .
germany is the first large european country to which groups of chinese tourists are allowed to travel to .
but that is set to change next year , when a whole host of other european union nations will open their borders to groups of chinese tourists . and although that could take the emphasis off germany as the eager tourists head off to see the sights of other continental countries , most in germany ’ s tourist industry are confident there are enough chinese tourists to go around for everyone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de light at the end of the tunnel for tourism industry ?

the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .

since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .
german hoteliers have some adapting to do to cater for their new guests , but brettschneider believes they will rise to the challenge because it is quite clearly a massive growth market for them . a growing trend at the moment chinese citizens are not allowed to travel to europe alone unless they have a personal invitation and are granted a visa from germany .
germany is the first large european country to which groups of chinese tourists are allowed to travel to .
but that is set to change next year , when a whole host of other european union nations will open their borders to groups of chinese tourists . and although that could take the emphasis off germany as the eager tourists head off to see the sights of other continental countries , most in germany ’ s tourist industry are confident there are enough chinese tourists to go around for everyone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de light at the end of the tunnel for tourism industry ?

since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .
german hoteliers have some adapting to do to cater for their new guests , but brettschneider believes they will rise to the challenge because it is quite clearly a massive growth market for them . a growing trend at the moment chinese citizens are not allowed to travel to europe alone unless they have a personal invitation and are granted a visa from germany .
germany is the first large european country to which groups of chinese tourists are allowed to travel to .
but that is set to change next year , when a whole host of other european union nations will open their borders to groups of chinese tourists . and although that could take the emphasis off germany as the eager tourists head off to see the sights of other continental countries , most in germany ’ s tourist industry are confident there are enough chinese tourists to go around for everyone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de light at the end of the tunnel for tourism industry ?

since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .
german hoteliers have some adapting to do to cater for their new guests , but brettschneider believes they will rise to the challenge because it is quite clearly a massive growth market for them . a growing trend at the moment chinese citizens are not allowed to travel to europe alone unless they have a personal invitation and are granted a visa from germany .
germany is the first large european country to which groups of chinese tourists are allowed to travel to .
but that is set to change next year , when a whole host of other european union nations will open their borders to groups of chinese tourists . and although that could take the emphasis off germany as the eager tourists head off to see the sights of other continental countries , most in germany ’ s tourist industry are confident there are enough chinese tourists to go around for everyone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de light at the end of the tunnel for tourism industry ?

since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .
german hoteliers have some adapting to do to cater for their new guests , but brettschneider believes they will rise to the challenge because it is quite clearly a massive growth market for them . a growing trend at the moment chinese citizens are not allowed to travel to europe alone unless they have a personal invitation and are granted a visa from germany .
germany is the first large european country to which groups of chinese tourists are allowed to travel to .
but that is set to change next year , when a whole host of other european union nations will open their borders to groups of chinese tourists . and although that could take the emphasis off germany as the eager tourists head off to see the sights of other continental countries , most in germany ’ s tourist industry are confident there are enough chinese tourists to go around for everyone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de light at the end of the tunnel for tourism industry ?

france thrashed germany ’ s national soccer team on saturday night 3-0 .
the french squad led by star midfielder zinedine zidane dominated the match despite the germans ’ home field advantage . the germans played a spirited first half in gelsenkirchen near dortmund , but were quickly outclassed by a french side including zidane and number of other leading european club players .
the german team , made up of less experienced younger players , were humbled in front of the home crowd of over 50,000 . “ i ’ m speechless , that was a catastrophic match for us .
we had planned to do so much .
i ’ m sorry for all the fans , ” said stuttgart ’ s 21 year-old rising star andreas hinkel .
“ they play together and know where they need to run .
we have to learn how to play together and come out as a team .
after the 0-2 we just fell apart . ” german national coach rudi völler lamented the fact that his team had once again failed to win against one of the so-called great soccer nations .
despite becoming runner-up at the 2002 world cup , germany has suffered defeats by argentina , brazil , england italy , the netherlands and france in recent years . “ after 60 minutes we gave up , we played with same trepidation against france like we did a few years ago .
that really bothered me , ” said völler .
he also defended german midfielder michael ballack , whose performance paled in comparison to zidane ’ s .
“ you can ’ t compare these two players .
zidane is the magician , ballack the finisher . ” no hope for kahn building on impressive creative playmaking from zidane , it only took 21 minutes for french striker thierry henry to put the ball past german goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn .
france ’ s other star forward david trezeguet then nailed the coffin shut with two goals in the second half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coach rudi völler “ every mistake against such teams will be punished without mercy .
however , we knew beforehand that players like henry , zidane , pirez and trezeguet can never be completely neutralized , ” said völler . the decisive victory on german soil showed france is gearing up to mount a strong defense of their european championship title next summer in portugal .
the squad of french coach jacques santini has now chalked up 13 straight victories , a new national record . during the match , the french players showed confidence proving they had put the unceremoniously early exit at the last world cup behind them .
afterwards , they calmly detailed what had unfortunately for völler and team amounted to walk in the park . “ it ’ s nice to win in germany .
we ’ re very pleased , ” said zidane . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a patchwork soccer pitch for germany a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .

france thrashed germany ’ s national soccer team on saturday night 3-0 .
the french squad led by star midfielder zinedine zidane dominated the match despite the germans ’ home field advantage . the germans played a spirited first half in gelsenkirchen near dortmund , but were quickly outclassed by a french side including zidane and number of other leading european club players .
the german team , made up of less experienced younger players , were humbled in front of the home crowd of over 50,000 . “ i ’ m speechless , that was a catastrophic match for us .
we had planned to do so much .

since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .
german hoteliers have some adapting to do to cater for their new guests , but brettschneider believes they will rise to the challenge because it is quite clearly a massive growth market for them . a growing trend at the moment chinese citizens are not allowed to travel to europe alone unless they have a personal invitation and are granted a visa from germany .
germany is the first large european country to which groups of chinese tourists are allowed to travel to .
but that is set to change next year , when a whole host of other european union nations will open their borders to groups of chinese tourists . and although that could take the emphasis off germany as the eager tourists head off to see the sights of other continental countries , most in germany ’ s tourist industry are confident there are enough chinese tourists to go around for everyone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de light at the end of the tunnel for tourism industry ?

the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .

the french squad led by star midfielder zinedine zidane dominated the match despite the germans ’ home field advantage . the germans played a spirited first half in gelsenkirchen near dortmund , but were quickly outclassed by a french side including zidane and number of other leading european club players .

since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .
the german tourist industry has been making the most of the new rules , offering both romantic castles and the speed of the autobahn . seductive advertising campaigns , depicting glossy images of teutonic castles nestled in the foothills of the alps , are designed to lure the new chinese tourists to " romantic " germany .
and with the german tourist board expecting some 600,000 overnight stays by chinese in this year alone , the campaigns are evidently having the desired effect . with such a massive growth market , china has become a breeding ground for big german tourism companies to launch chinese ventures , such as the newly founded joint venture tui china . with the chinese economy booming , and an increasing number of citizens actually able to afford a trip to europe , germany looks set to profit .
guido brettschneider of tui china said current statistics show that as many as 85 million chinese citizens – more than the entire population of germany – can now afford to travel abroad .
" they are usually young people , between 25 and 40 years old .
europe is a very important destination for them , and we believe the number of guests will continue to rise in the future , " brettschneider told deutsche welle . getting their money 's worth for a week in germany , chinese tourists are generally looking at a sum of at least € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,170 -rrb- .
that 's a lot of money by chinese standards , which is why they want to be sure they are getting their money 's worth .
for many chinese visitors , that means doing more than simply seeing a few castles . one absolutely must-do activity on a standard trip to germany is factory outlet shopping in southern germany .
but even that does n't satisfy all the whims of these new tourists . " the chinese love cars , they love to travel as fast as possible , they love modern technology , " said brettschneider , adding the chinese love the idea of the unrestricted speed limits on germany 's famous autobahn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tui is planning to make the most of this passion for speed and modern technology , and from next year they will offer their tourists the chance to zip along the highways for themselves .
it 's clever seduction for visitors who are used to stubborn inner-city traffic jams and highway tolls and strict speed limits . only the best will do autobahn aside , the chinese tourists expect the best when they shell out to come to germany , and by and large they are not disappointed .
they are put up in excellent hotels and chauffered around in state-of-the-art buses , but brettschneider is quick to point out that chinese tourists do n't want to be overwhelmed with the unknown and the unfamiliar when they journey west . " they generally want to eat chinese food , and they have particular demands when it comes to hotel rooms .
they expect to find such things as a kettle " , he said .
german hoteliers have some adapting to do to cater for their new guests , but brettschneider believes they will rise to the challenge because it is quite clearly a massive growth market for them . a growing trend at the moment chinese citizens are not allowed to travel to europe alone unless they have a personal invitation and are granted a visa from germany .
germany is the first large european country to which groups of chinese tourists are allowed to travel to .
but that is set to change next year , when a whole host of other european union nations will open their borders to groups of chinese tourists . and although that could take the emphasis off germany as the eager tourists head off to see the sights of other continental countries , most in germany ’ s tourist industry are confident there are enough chinese tourists to go around for everyone . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de light at the end of the tunnel for tourism industry ?

justice minister cathy jamieson has admitted the policy is being considered as part of a range of measures aimed at helping criminals change their behaviour .
latest figures show that more than seven out of 10 prisoners re-offend within four years of being released .
ms jamieson said she wanted to see monitoring of prisoners after their release " beefed up " if it is feared they could re-offend .
pressed on whether or not that meant some prisoners could be tagged upon release , the minister said there was " no reason why we would rule that out " .
and she claimed the move would be backed by both local communities and the nation 's judges .
it would give local communities much more confidence and might also give the judiciary more confidence if they felt there 's a closer monitoring of people cathy jamieson she said : " in some instances it might be the right thing to do if there is a significant concern about that person 's movements .
" it could be part of a package of intensive support and supervision . "
the minister added : " there are already stringent measures in place to supervise certain offenders when they come back into the community .
" but this may give us an opportunity to try to do that rehabilitation back into the community under supervision .
" it would give local communities much more confidence and might also give the judiciary more confidence if they felt there 's a closer monitoring of people when they come back into the community . "
ministers have already unveiled plans for the tagging of dangerous criminals , young tearaways and reluctant witnesses .

justice minister cathy jamieson has admitted the policy is being considered as part of a range of measures aimed at helping criminals change their behaviour .
latest figures show that more than seven out of 10 prisoners re-offend within four years of being released .
ms jamieson said she wanted to see monitoring of prisoners after their release " beefed up " if it is feared they could re-offend .
pressed on whether or not that meant some prisoners could be tagged upon release , the minister said there was " no reason why we would rule that out " .
and she claimed the move would be backed by both local communities and the nation 's judges .
it would give local communities much more confidence and might also give the judiciary more confidence if they felt there 's a closer monitoring of people cathy jamieson she said : " in some instances it might be the right thing to do if there is a significant concern about that person 's movements .
" it could be part of a package of intensive support and supervision . "
the minister added : " there are already stringent measures in place to supervise certain offenders when they come back into the community .

justice minister cathy jamieson said the proposed court would respect " the unique nature " of the scottish justice system .
in its formal response to the proposals , the scottish executive told the newly-created department of constitutional affairs it " welcomed " the plan .
the proposal for a supreme court forms part of wider constitutional changes which include the scrapping of the post of lord chancellor .
at present , criminal appeals are heard in scotland but the appellate committee of the house of lords is the ultimate court of appeal for civil cases in scotland .
under the changes , the supreme court would take over this function for civil appeals , and criminal appeals would continue to be heard in scotland except for those cases that throw up " devolution issues " .
we believe a supreme court for the whole of the uk will bring greater coherence to the system both north and south of the border cathy jamieson as it was the scotland act - a piece of westminster legislation - which incorporated the european human rights convention into scottish law , some scottish criminal appeals could raise issues which will now go to the supreme court .
nationalists claim the reform is " a missed opportunity " and want all appeals to be heard in scotland .
the faculty of advocates also warned the new supreme court could be illegal under the 1707 act of union unless the supreme court is completely separated from the department of constitutional affairs .
but the executive submission voiced no such concern .
it warns , however , that it is " essential " for the membership of the new court to include at least two people qualified in scots law , and calls for statutory safeguards to enshrine this .
ms jamieson said it was an " opportunity " rather than a threat .
" scotland is an integral part of the uk and this is an important step in devolving modern justice and constitutional systems with the right arrangements for scotland 's distinct laws and institutions , " she added .
" we believe a supreme court for the whole of the uk will bring greater coherence to the system both north and south of the border . "

the two are the first western firms to win energy rights in saudi arabia since the industry was nationalised in 1975 .
the european firms will find and pump gas in 80,000 square miles of the vast south-eastern empty quarter desert .
saudi oil minister ali naimi said the deal was the " first in a series " to promote industrialisation and economic development in the kingdom .
saudi arabia , the world 's largest oil exporter , is also thought to have the fourth largest reserves of natural gas in the world .
the two companies will work in a consortium with saudi state oil firm aramco to explore , develop and produce the gas .
shell will have 40 % of the project while total and aramco will have 30 % each .
' token investment ' the 25-year concession is a smaller project than the vast deals often associated with shell and total , two of the world 's top five oil companies .
and it falls a long way short of the $ 20bn package saudi arabia originally envisaged , a deal which collapsed earlier this year when the sides could not agree terms .
as such , it amounted to a " missed opportunity " , said saudi billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal , a nephew of king fahd , who dubbed it a " token investment " .
still , the signing - coming only a week after the devastating bombing of a riyadh shopping complex which killed at least 18 people - will be seen as a much-needed boost to the kingdom 's efforts to attract foreign investment .
it also gives shell and total a key foothold in the country with the world 's largest hydrocarbon reserves .
saudi oil minister ali naimi signed the deal in riyadh with total chairman and ceo thierry desmarest , and sir phillip watts , chairman of the committee of managing directors of royal dutch / shell .
mr watts said exploration should start " without delay " .
more bids invited mr naimi said saudi arabia wanted to encourage more international oil companies to invest in the kingdom 's gas sector .
he said the project was " the first of a series of energy projects based on the new investment environment in the kingdom " .
saudi arabia will embark on a " series of investment projects " to promote industrialisation , bolster economic development and " enable the formation of lucrative and mutually beneficial long-range business partnerships " , he said .
his country has invited bids " for other promising areas in north rub al-khali -lsb- empty quarter -rsb- " , he said .
mr naimi has previously been seen as an opponent to the idea of opening up his country 's reserves to foreign investment .
