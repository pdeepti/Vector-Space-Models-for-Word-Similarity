back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .

" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .
but much of the interest focused on radical islamic terrorism in the name of allah rather than the daily lives of germany ’ s muslims .
and that ’ s a trend that gets under the skin of many young muslims in germany .
" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’
they aren ’ t actually showing what actual islam is about . "
a religion under investigation shortly after the sept .
11 attacks , the german government strengthened its domestic security laws in order to make it easier to catch potential terrorists before they act .
initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .
" my wish would be that the people , especially muslims , would participate more actively in politics and other issues in order to take their rights more seriously and , perhaps , enforce them , " says asksar .
" right now nobody ’ s doing that .
people are doing too little to raise attention to themselves .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .
but much of the interest focused on radical islamic terrorism in the name of allah rather than the daily lives of germany ’ s muslims .
and that ’ s a trend that gets under the skin of many young muslims in germany .
" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’
they aren ’ t actually showing what actual islam is about . "
a religion under investigation shortly after the sept .
11 attacks , the german government strengthened its domestic security laws in order to make it easier to catch potential terrorists before they act .
initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .
" my wish would be that the people , especially muslims , would participate more actively in politics and other issues in order to take their rights more seriously and , perhaps , enforce them , " says asksar .
" right now nobody ’ s doing that .
people are doing too little to raise attention to themselves .
people really need to get much more engaged and do a lot more in order to get ahead .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .
the three countries actively opposed washington 's campaign to wage war in the run up to the invasion of iraq . eu still divided on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana adresses the media after a general .
the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .
the u.s. deputy ambassador to the un james cunningham refused to comment directly on the amendments but instead remained focussed on the immense task of bringing the international community together on the best course of action in iraq . amendments not the focus for geneva bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations building in new york .
cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq . " that job seems to involve , according to the draft resolution from washington , the u.s.-appointed iraqi governing council cooperating with the united nations and u.s. officials in baghdad to produce " a timetable and program for the drafting of a new constitution for iraq and for the holding of democratic elections . " faster timetable to stability and sovereignty however , it does not satisfy the germans , french or russians due to the lack of time frame the three countries believe is needed to bring rapid stability to iraq .
they contend that the u.s. draft leaves key decision making in the hands of the iraqi governing council , which has taken months to form a cabinet .
germany , france and russia want a much faster timetable than the u.s. plan would provide . their amendments call for immediately “ initiating under the auspices of the u.n. a new process leading ... to the full restoration of iraqi authority ” and for an interim iraqi administration to take control of “ all civilian areas , including control over natural resources and use of international assistance . ” fischer calls for strategic reorientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell , left , and joschka fischer .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has made it clear that france and germany will continue to press for a change of strategy .
“ it is important now that we introduce a strategic re-orientation , ” said fischer .
“ only then will we be able to achieve peace in iraq .
it is a priority for us to restore iraqi sovereignty and a legitimate iraqi government as quickly as possible in order to establish security and stability that give iraqis a new perspective . ” while the germans , french and russians are united in their call for the united nations to assist the governing council in developing a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections , the russians do n't go as far in demanding the immediate handover of authority to iraqis . powell dismisses amendments u.s. secretary of state colin powell immediately ridiculed the idea in an interview with the arabic television channel al-jazeera on wednesday night .
powell argued that suggestions that all the united states would have to do was to find an iraqi who was passing by and give him the government were not acceptable . he added that it was also ludicrous and unfeasible for anyone to demand that american representative paul bremer and the coalition forces leave iraq at this point in time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .
the three countries actively opposed washington 's campaign to wage war in the run up to the invasion of iraq . eu still divided on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana adresses the media after a general .
the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .
the u.s. deputy ambassador to the un james cunningham refused to comment directly on the amendments but instead remained focussed on the immense task of bringing the international community together on the best course of action in iraq . amendments not the focus for geneva bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations building in new york .
cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq . " that job seems to involve , according to the draft resolution from washington , the u.s.-appointed iraqi governing council cooperating with the united nations and u.s. officials in baghdad to produce " a timetable and program for the drafting of a new constitution for iraq and for the holding of democratic elections . " faster timetable to stability and sovereignty however , it does not satisfy the germans , french or russians due to the lack of time frame the three countries believe is needed to bring rapid stability to iraq .
they contend that the u.s. draft leaves key decision making in the hands of the iraqi governing council , which has taken months to form a cabinet .
germany , france and russia want a much faster timetable than the u.s. plan would provide . their amendments call for immediately “ initiating under the auspices of the u.n. a new process leading ... to the full restoration of iraqi authority ” and for an interim iraqi administration to take control of “ all civilian areas , including control over natural resources and use of international assistance . ” fischer calls for strategic reorientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell , left , and joschka fischer .

“ it is important now that we introduce a strategic re-orientation , ” said fischer .
“ only then will we be able to achieve peace in iraq .
it is a priority for us to restore iraqi sovereignty and a legitimate iraqi government as quickly as possible in order to establish security and stability that give iraqis a new perspective . ” while the germans , french and russians are united in their call for the united nations to assist the governing council in developing a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections , the russians do n't go as far in demanding the immediate handover of authority to iraqis . powell dismisses amendments u.s. secretary of state colin powell immediately ridiculed the idea in an interview with the arabic television channel al-jazeera on wednesday night .
powell argued that suggestions that all the united states would have to do was to find an iraqi who was passing by and give him the government were not acceptable . he added that it was also ludicrous and unfeasible for anyone to demand that american representative paul bremer and the coalition forces leave iraq at this point in time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .

the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign . " redefinition " of the relationship talk instead is of increasing the € 75 million -lrb- $ 84 million -rrb- financial aid package to iraq and offering german law enforcement expertise to train iraqi policemen , perhaps in germany . it is part of what german politicians , like foreign minister joschka fischer , are calling a " redefinition " of the transatlantic relationship .
" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .

secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.09.2003 germany sends troops to scout out expanding afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers have been serving in afghanistan since 2002 .
german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .
a broad consensus for the work of the bundeswehr in afghanistan is in germany 's interest , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghanistan - " dangerous deployment for several years " german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans .

this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .

both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .
representing this interest and paying the price - that is what german foreign policy has learned . ute thofern-dieste send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is europe prepared for the inevitable ?

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .
his election campaign vow in august 2002 that no german troops would set foot on iraqi soil as part of a u.s. military invasion apparently shut down communication between the white house and chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured u.s. soldier being evaucated from iraq until recently .
the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign . " redefinition " of the relationship talk instead is of increasing the € 75 million -lrb- $ 84 million -rrb- financial aid package to iraq and offering german law enforcement expertise to train iraqi policemen , perhaps in germany . it is part of what german politicians , like foreign minister joschka fischer , are calling a " redefinition " of the transatlantic relationship .
" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .
a poll by the transatlantic organization the german marshall fund released september 4 revealed that one in every two germans thought u.s. world leadership was " undesirable . "
such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .
secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role . " suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .
his election campaign vow in august 2002 that no german troops would set foot on iraqi soil as part of a u.s. military invasion apparently shut down communication between the white house and chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured u.s. soldier being evaucated from iraq until recently .
the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign . " redefinition " of the relationship talk instead is of increasing the € 75 million -lrb- $ 84 million -rrb- financial aid package to iraq and offering german law enforcement expertise to train iraqi policemen , perhaps in germany . it is part of what german politicians , like foreign minister joschka fischer , are calling a " redefinition " of the transatlantic relationship .
" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .
a poll by the transatlantic organization the german marshall fund released september 4 revealed that one in every two germans thought u.s. world leadership was " undesirable . "
such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .
secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role . " suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .
but much of the interest focused on radical islamic terrorism in the name of allah rather than the daily lives of germany ’ s muslims .
and that ’ s a trend that gets under the skin of many young muslims in germany .
" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’
they aren ’ t actually showing what actual islam is about . "
a religion under investigation shortly after the sept .
11 attacks , the german government strengthened its domestic security laws in order to make it easier to catch potential terrorists before they act .
initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .
" my wish would be that the people , especially muslims , would participate more actively in politics and other issues in order to take their rights more seriously and , perhaps , enforce them , " says asksar .
" right now nobody ’ s doing that .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .
but much of the interest focused on radical islamic terrorism in the name of allah rather than the daily lives of germany ’ s muslims .
and that ’ s a trend that gets under the skin of many young muslims in germany .
" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’
they aren ’ t actually showing what actual islam is about . "
a religion under investigation shortly after the sept .
11 attacks , the german government strengthened its domestic security laws in order to make it easier to catch potential terrorists before they act .
initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .
" my wish would be that the people , especially muslims , would participate more actively in politics and other issues in order to take their rights more seriously and , perhaps , enforce them , " says asksar .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .
but much of the interest focused on radical islamic terrorism in the name of allah rather than the daily lives of germany ’ s muslims .
and that ’ s a trend that gets under the skin of many young muslims in germany .
" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’
they aren ’ t actually showing what actual islam is about . "
a religion under investigation shortly after the sept .
11 attacks , the german government strengthened its domestic security laws in order to make it easier to catch potential terrorists before they act .
initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .
" my wish would be that the people , especially muslims , would participate more actively in politics and other issues in order to take their rights more seriously and , perhaps , enforce them , " says asksar .
" right now nobody ’ s doing that .
people are doing too little to raise attention to themselves .
people really need to get much more engaged and do a lot more in order to get ahead .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .

the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .

cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq .

it is a priority for us to restore iraqi sovereignty and a legitimate iraqi government as quickly as possible in order to establish security and stability that give iraqis a new perspective . ” while the germans , french and russians are united in their call for the united nations to assist the governing council in developing a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections , the russians do n't go as far in demanding the immediate handover of authority to iraqis . powell dismisses amendments u.s. secretary of state colin powell immediately ridiculed the idea in an interview with the arabic television channel al-jazeera on wednesday night .
powell argued that suggestions that all the united states would have to do was to find an iraqi who was passing by and give him the government were not acceptable . he added that it was also ludicrous and unfeasible for anyone to demand that american representative paul bremer and the coalition forces leave iraq at this point in time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .
the three countries actively opposed washington 's campaign to wage war in the run up to the invasion of iraq . eu still divided on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana adresses the media after a general .
the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .
the u.s. deputy ambassador to the un james cunningham refused to comment directly on the amendments but instead remained focussed on the immense task of bringing the international community together on the best course of action in iraq . amendments not the focus for geneva bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations building in new york .
cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq . " that job seems to involve , according to the draft resolution from washington , the u.s.-appointed iraqi governing council cooperating with the united nations and u.s. officials in baghdad to produce " a timetable and program for the drafting of a new constitution for iraq and for the holding of democratic elections . " faster timetable to stability and sovereignty however , it does not satisfy the germans , french or russians due to the lack of time frame the three countries believe is needed to bring rapid stability to iraq .
they contend that the u.s. draft leaves key decision making in the hands of the iraqi governing council , which has taken months to form a cabinet .
germany , france and russia want a much faster timetable than the u.s. plan would provide . their amendments call for immediately “ initiating under the auspices of the u.n. a new process leading ... to the full restoration of iraqi authority ” and for an interim iraqi administration to take control of “ all civilian areas , including control over natural resources and use of international assistance . ” fischer calls for strategic reorientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell , left , and joschka fischer .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has made it clear that france and germany will continue to press for a change of strategy .
“ it is important now that we introduce a strategic re-orientation , ” said fischer .
“ only then will we be able to achieve peace in iraq .
it is a priority for us to restore iraqi sovereignty and a legitimate iraqi government as quickly as possible in order to establish security and stability that give iraqis a new perspective . ” while the germans , french and russians are united in their call for the united nations to assist the governing council in developing a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections , the russians do n't go as far in demanding the immediate handover of authority to iraqis . powell dismisses amendments u.s. secretary of state colin powell immediately ridiculed the idea in an interview with the arabic television channel al-jazeera on wednesday night .
powell argued that suggestions that all the united states would have to do was to find an iraqi who was passing by and give him the government were not acceptable . he added that it was also ludicrous and unfeasible for anyone to demand that american representative paul bremer and the coalition forces leave iraq at this point in time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”
hoon responded by addressing the house of commons on thursday , telling parliament that he had no intention of being anything other than “ open and straightforward ” with the committee and that he regretted any misunderstanding that might have arisen .
“ i hope the committee accepts that i did not in fact mislead them , ” he said .
calls for defense minister to resign his statement failed to convince the head of the opposition , iain duncan smith , who once again called on hoon to resign .
the conservative leader , who had already raised the subject of hoon stepping down over his department ’ s involvement in the scandal surrounding the apparent suicide of weapons expert dr. david kelly , addressed parliament , saying : “ geoff hoon has got to go , i 'm afraid .
either he should resign or the prime minister should dismiss him at once . ”
“ i think this report is a damning report of the secretary of state -lrb- for defense -rrb- .
the committee has accused him of misleading and withholding information . ...
my concern right now is that we have troops in iraq whose lives are at risk under the authority of the secretary of state . ”
foreign secretary jack straw defended his colleague when he addressed reporters following the publication of the committee ’ s report : " i 'm in no doubt the defense secretary should and will continue in his post .
he has every confidence of the prime minister . "
ministry of defense faces further scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons advisor .
the ministry of defense is currently also under pressure from a further inquiry , headed by appeals judge , lord hutton .
the hutton inquiry surrounds the suicide of dr. kelly and the alleged link to claims by the bbc journalist andrew gilligan that the government knew that information in the iraq dossier to be false .
dr. kelly was named as the source of gilligan ’ s claims on july 9 , nine days before his body was found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de will hutton inquiry leave a political body trail ?

back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror .

such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .

" suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .
a poll by the transatlantic organization the german marshall fund released september 4 revealed that one in every two germans thought u.s. world leadership was " undesirable . "
such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .
secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role . " suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .
a broad consensus for the work of the bundeswehr in afghanistan is in germany 's interest , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghanistan - " dangerous deployment for several years " german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans .

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .
his election campaign vow in august 2002 that no german troops would set foot on iraqi soil as part of a u.s. military invasion apparently shut down communication between the white house and chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured u.s. soldier being evaucated from iraq until recently .
the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign . " redefinition " of the relationship talk instead is of increasing the € 75 million -lrb- $ 84 million -rrb- financial aid package to iraq and offering german law enforcement expertise to train iraqi policemen , perhaps in germany . it is part of what german politicians , like foreign minister joschka fischer , are calling a " redefinition " of the transatlantic relationship .
" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .
a poll by the transatlantic organization the german marshall fund released september 4 revealed that one in every two germans thought u.s. world leadership was " undesirable . "
such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .
secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role . " suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .

u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .

the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .

cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq .

they contend that the u.s. draft leaves key decision making in the hands of the iraqi governing council , which has taken months to form a cabinet .
germany , france and russia want a much faster timetable than the u.s. plan would provide . their amendments call for immediately “ initiating under the auspices of the u.n. a new process leading ... to the full restoration of iraqi authority ” and for an interim iraqi administration to take control of “ all civilian areas , including control over natural resources and use of international assistance . ” fischer calls for strategic reorientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell , left , and joschka fischer .

it is a priority for us to restore iraqi sovereignty and a legitimate iraqi government as quickly as possible in order to establish security and stability that give iraqis a new perspective . ” while the germans , french and russians are united in their call for the united nations to assist the governing council in developing a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections , the russians do n't go as far in demanding the immediate handover of authority to iraqis . powell dismisses amendments u.s. secretary of state colin powell immediately ridiculed the idea in an interview with the arabic television channel al-jazeera on wednesday night .
powell argued that suggestions that all the united states would have to do was to find an iraqi who was passing by and give him the government were not acceptable . he added that it was also ludicrous and unfeasible for anyone to demand that american representative paul bremer and the coalition forces leave iraq at this point in time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2003 british government cleared of “ sexing up ” dossier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no sex please , we 're british the committee investigating the british government ’ s role in the alleged exaggeration of iraq ’ s military capabilities has cleared the government , but not without harsh criticism of its defense secretary . the intelligence and security committee -lrb- isc -rrb- in charge of investigating claims that the british government embellished details in its iraq dossier to strengthen its case for war , has said that the government report on saddam hussein ’ s weapons of mass destruction had not been deliberately “ sexed up ” by former director of communications alistair campbell or “ anyone else . ” thursday 's announcement marked the second time in recent months the government has been exonerated of any wrong-doing in the management of the iraq dossier .
back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”
hoon responded by addressing the house of commons on thursday , telling parliament that he had no intention of being anything other than “ open and straightforward ” with the committee and that he regretted any misunderstanding that might have arisen .
“ i hope the committee accepts that i did not in fact mislead them , ” he said .
calls for defense minister to resign his statement failed to convince the head of the opposition , iain duncan smith , who once again called on hoon to resign .
the conservative leader , who had already raised the subject of hoon stepping down over his department ’ s involvement in the scandal surrounding the apparent suicide of weapons expert dr. david kelly , addressed parliament , saying : “ geoff hoon has got to go , i 'm afraid .
either he should resign or the prime minister should dismiss him at once . ”
“ i think this report is a damning report of the secretary of state -lrb- for defense -rrb- .
the committee has accused him of misleading and withholding information . ...
my concern right now is that we have troops in iraq whose lives are at risk under the authority of the secretary of state . ”
foreign secretary jack straw defended his colleague when he addressed reporters following the publication of the committee ’ s report : " i 'm in no doubt the defense secretary should and will continue in his post .
he has every confidence of the prime minister . "
ministry of defense faces further scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons advisor .

back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”
hoon responded by addressing the house of commons on thursday , telling parliament that he had no intention of being anything other than “ open and straightforward ” with the committee and that he regretted any misunderstanding that might have arisen .
“ i hope the committee accepts that i did not in fact mislead them , ” he said .
calls for defense minister to resign his statement failed to convince the head of the opposition , iain duncan smith , who once again called on hoon to resign .
the conservative leader , who had already raised the subject of hoon stepping down over his department ’ s involvement in the scandal surrounding the apparent suicide of weapons expert dr. david kelly , addressed parliament , saying : “ geoff hoon has got to go , i 'm afraid .
either he should resign or the prime minister should dismiss him at once . ”
“ i think this report is a damning report of the secretary of state -lrb- for defense -rrb- .
the committee has accused him of misleading and withholding information . ...
my concern right now is that we have troops in iraq whose lives are at risk under the authority of the secretary of state . ”

back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”
hoon responded by addressing the house of commons on thursday , telling parliament that he had no intention of being anything other than “ open and straightforward ” with the committee and that he regretted any misunderstanding that might have arisen .
“ i hope the committee accepts that i did not in fact mislead them , ” he said .
calls for defense minister to resign his statement failed to convince the head of the opposition , iain duncan smith , who once again called on hoon to resign .
the conservative leader , who had already raised the subject of hoon stepping down over his department ’ s involvement in the scandal surrounding the apparent suicide of weapons expert dr. david kelly , addressed parliament , saying : “ geoff hoon has got to go , i 'm afraid .
either he should resign or the prime minister should dismiss him at once . ”
“ i think this report is a damning report of the secretary of state -lrb- for defense -rrb- .
the committee has accused him of misleading and withholding information . ...
my concern right now is that we have troops in iraq whose lives are at risk under the authority of the secretary of state . ”
foreign secretary jack straw defended his colleague when he addressed reporters following the publication of the committee ’ s report : " i 'm in no doubt the defense secretary should and will continue in his post .
he has every confidence of the prime minister . "
ministry of defense faces further scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons advisor .
the ministry of defense is currently also under pressure from a further inquiry , headed by appeals judge , lord hutton .
the hutton inquiry surrounds the suicide of dr. kelly and the alleged link to claims by the bbc journalist andrew gilligan that the government knew that information in the iraq dossier to be false .

11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .

churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .

suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .
but much of the interest focused on radical islamic terrorism in the name of allah rather than the daily lives of germany ’ s muslims .
and that ’ s a trend that gets under the skin of many young muslims in germany .
" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’

a religion under investigation shortly after the sept .
11 attacks , the german government strengthened its domestic security laws in order to make it easier to catch potential terrorists before they act .
initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .

that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .
" my wish would be that the people , especially muslims , would participate more actively in politics and other issues in order to take their rights more seriously and , perhaps , enforce them , " says asksar .
" right now nobody ’ s doing that .
people are doing too little to raise attention to themselves .
people really need to get much more engaged and do a lot more in order to get ahead .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .

the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign . " redefinition " of the relationship talk instead is of increasing the € 75 million -lrb- $ 84 million -rrb- financial aid package to iraq and offering german law enforcement expertise to train iraqi policemen , perhaps in germany . it is part of what german politicians , like foreign minister joschka fischer , are calling a " redefinition " of the transatlantic relationship .
" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .
a poll by the transatlantic organization the german marshall fund released september 4 revealed that one in every two germans thought u.s. world leadership was " undesirable . "
such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .
secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role . " suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .
his election campaign vow in august 2002 that no german troops would set foot on iraqi soil as part of a u.s. military invasion apparently shut down communication between the white house and chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured u.s. soldier being evaucated from iraq until recently .
the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign . " redefinition " of the relationship talk instead is of increasing the € 75 million -lrb- $ 84 million -rrb- financial aid package to iraq and offering german law enforcement expertise to train iraqi policemen , perhaps in germany . it is part of what german politicians , like foreign minister joschka fischer , are calling a " redefinition " of the transatlantic relationship .
" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .
a poll by the transatlantic organization the german marshall fund released september 4 revealed that one in every two germans thought u.s. world leadership was " undesirable . "
such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .
secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role . " suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .
representing this interest and paying the price - that is what german foreign policy has learned . ute thofern-dieste send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is europe prepared for the inevitable ?

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .
his election campaign vow in august 2002 that no german troops would set foot on iraqi soil as part of a u.s. military invasion apparently shut down communication between the white house and chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured u.s. soldier being evaucated from iraq until recently .
the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign . " redefinition " of the relationship talk instead is of increasing the € 75 million -lrb- $ 84 million -rrb- financial aid package to iraq and offering german law enforcement expertise to train iraqi policemen , perhaps in germany . it is part of what german politicians , like foreign minister joschka fischer , are calling a " redefinition " of the transatlantic relationship .
" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .
a poll by the transatlantic organization the german marshall fund released september 4 revealed that one in every two germans thought u.s. world leadership was " undesirable . "
such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .
secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role . " suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : schröder hopes to mend ties with bush the powell visit rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments u.s. and europe face diplomatic challenges in evian germany : no nato in iraq without un germany -pipe- 11.09.2003 opinion : sept .
11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .
representing this interest and paying the price - that is what german foreign policy has learned . ute thofern-dieste send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is europe prepared for the inevitable ?

back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”
hoon responded by addressing the house of commons on thursday , telling parliament that he had no intention of being anything other than “ open and straightforward ” with the committee and that he regretted any misunderstanding that might have arisen .
“ i hope the committee accepts that i did not in fact mislead them , ” he said .
calls for defense minister to resign his statement failed to convince the head of the opposition , iain duncan smith , who once again called on hoon to resign .
the conservative leader , who had already raised the subject of hoon stepping down over his department ’ s involvement in the scandal surrounding the apparent suicide of weapons expert dr. david kelly , addressed parliament , saying : “ geoff hoon has got to go , i 'm afraid .
either he should resign or the prime minister should dismiss him at once . ”
“ i think this report is a damning report of the secretary of state -lrb- for defense -rrb- .
the committee has accused him of misleading and withholding information . ...
my concern right now is that we have troops in iraq whose lives are at risk under the authority of the secretary of state . ”
foreign secretary jack straw defended his colleague when he addressed reporters following the publication of the committee ’ s report : " i 'm in no doubt the defense secretary should and will continue in his post .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .
the three countries actively opposed washington 's campaign to wage war in the run up to the invasion of iraq . eu still divided on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana adresses the media after a general .
the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday . foreign minister anna lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular and respected politicians and a leading pro-euro campaigner , succumbed to her serious injuries in a hospital in stockholm on thurssday morning .
lindh was stabbed in the chest , stomach and arms by an unidentified swedish man in a department store on wednesday .
she was admitted in critical condition to stockholm ’ s karolinksa hospital and underwent immediate surgery .
karolinska hospital said in a statement that lindh died of " massive bleeding caused by knife wounds to the liver and many of the big blood vessels in the abdomen " .
swedish prime minister göran persson said lindh ’ s loss would be felt deeply by the nation .
" i have received with sorrow , information that sweden 's foreign minister anna lindh died this morning at 5:29 a.m.
-lrb- 3:29 gmt -rrb- of her wounds , " persson told a news conference on thursday morning .
" sweden has lost one of its most important representatives . "
european leaders joined in paying tributes to a person german foriegn minister joschka fisher called " a great european , a great foreign minister and also a good friend . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder added , " her engagement for world peace and human rights and for the union of europe in particular will be missed . "
italian prime minister and incumbent president of the european union silvio berlusconi called lindh 's murder " a tragedy " while french president jacques chirac recalled her as " a woman of extraordinary cheerfulness and kindness . "
as flags flew at half mast across europe , the grief stretched over the atlantic , prompting u.s. secretary of state colin powell to say , " she had a special energy , integrity and compassion and she spent a great deal of her time focusing her efforts on global humanitarian issues . "
president george w. bush said in a statement that he was " shocked and saddened " by the death of " a tireless advocate of freedom and peace . "

it is not uncommon for politicians in sweden - which enjoys a relatively low crime rate - to travel without the protection of body guards .
" for the swedish people it brings back all the old horrible memories of olof palme , " green party leader peter eriksson told the french news agency afp .
" it might mean swedish politicians need security guards everywhere they go from now on , " eriksson said .
" i sincerely hope it does n't lead to that . "
" an attack against democracy " " this is a horrible tragedy and an attack against our democracy , " persson said on wednesday before announcing he would suspend all campaign efforts in the lead up to sweden ’ s referendum on euro zone membership scheduled for sunday .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .
but much of the interest focused on radical islamic terrorism in the name of allah rather than the daily lives of germany ’ s muslims .
and that ’ s a trend that gets under the skin of many young muslims in germany .
" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’
they aren ’ t actually showing what actual islam is about . "
a religion under investigation shortly after the sept .
11 attacks , the german government strengthened its domestic security laws in order to make it easier to catch potential terrorists before they act .
initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .
" my wish would be that the people , especially muslims , would participate more actively in politics and other issues in order to take their rights more seriously and , perhaps , enforce them , " says asksar .
" right now nobody ’ s doing that .
people are doing too little to raise attention to themselves .

in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .

greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .

suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .

" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’

initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .

swedish foreign minister anna lindh died early on thursday morning , after she was stabbed by an unidentified man in a stockholm department store on wednesday . foreign minister anna lindh , one of sweden ’ s most popular and respected politicians and a leading pro-euro campaigner , succumbed to her serious injuries in a hospital in stockholm on thurssday morning .
lindh was stabbed in the chest , stomach and arms by an unidentified swedish man in a department store on wednesday .
she was admitted in critical condition to stockholm ’ s karolinksa hospital and underwent immediate surgery .
karolinska hospital said in a statement that lindh died of " massive bleeding caused by knife wounds to the liver and many of the big blood vessels in the abdomen " .
swedish prime minister göran persson said lindh ’ s loss would be felt deeply by the nation .
" i have received with sorrow , information that sweden 's foreign minister anna lindh died this morning at 5:29 a.m.
-lrb- 3:29 gmt -rrb- of her wounds , " persson told a news conference on thursday morning .
" sweden has lost one of its most important representatives . "
european leaders joined in paying tributes to a person german foriegn minister joschka fisher called " a great european , a great foreign minister and also a good friend . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder added , " her engagement for world peace and human rights and for the union of europe in particular will be missed . "
italian prime minister and incumbent president of the european union silvio berlusconi called lindh 's murder " a tragedy " while french president jacques chirac recalled her as " a woman of extraordinary cheerfulness and kindness . "
as flags flew at half mast across europe , the grief stretched over the atlantic , prompting u.s. secretary of state colin powell to say , " she had a special energy , integrity and compassion and she spent a great deal of her time focusing her efforts on global humanitarian issues . "
president george w. bush said in a statement that he was " shocked and saddened " by the death of " a tireless advocate of freedom and peace . "
killing rekindles swedish security fears it ’ s the first political assassination in sweden since the unsolved murder of prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
it is not uncommon for politicians in sweden - which enjoys a relatively low crime rate - to travel without the protection of body guards .
" for the swedish people it brings back all the old horrible memories of olof palme , " green party leader peter eriksson told the french news agency afp .
" it might mean swedish politicians need security guards everywhere they go from now on , " eriksson said .
" i sincerely hope it does n't lead to that . "
" an attack against democracy " " this is a horrible tragedy and an attack against our democracy , " persson said on wednesday before announcing he would suspend all campaign efforts in the lead up to sweden ’ s referendum on euro zone membership scheduled for sunday .
but persson and police refused to speculate on the motives behind the attack .

numerous witnesses said a 1.8 meter tall -lrb- 6 foot tall -rrb- man wearing a military jacket suddenly attacked the foreign minister with a knife and later escaped , drenched in blood .
the foreign minister was one of swedan ’ s strongest supporters for the introduction of the euro , europe ’ s common currency - a campaign that has divided the scandinavian country .
lindh , 46 , had served as foreign minister since 1998 .

back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”
hoon responded by addressing the house of commons on thursday , telling parliament that he had no intention of being anything other than “ open and straightforward ” with the committee and that he regretted any misunderstanding that might have arisen .
“ i hope the committee accepts that i did not in fact mislead them , ” he said .
calls for defense minister to resign his statement failed to convince the head of the opposition , iain duncan smith , who once again called on hoon to resign .
the conservative leader , who had already raised the subject of hoon stepping down over his department ’ s involvement in the scandal surrounding the apparent suicide of weapons expert dr. david kelly , addressed parliament , saying : “ geoff hoon has got to go , i 'm afraid .
either he should resign or the prime minister should dismiss him at once . ”
“ i think this report is a damning report of the secretary of state -lrb- for defense -rrb- .
the committee has accused him of misleading and withholding information . ...
my concern right now is that we have troops in iraq whose lives are at risk under the authority of the secretary of state . ”
foreign secretary jack straw defended his colleague when he addressed reporters following the publication of the committee ’ s report : " i 'm in no doubt the defense secretary should and will continue in his post .
he has every confidence of the prime minister . "
ministry of defense faces further scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons advisor .
the ministry of defense is currently also under pressure from a further inquiry , headed by appeals judge , lord hutton .
the hutton inquiry surrounds the suicide of dr. kelly and the alleged link to claims by the bbc journalist andrew gilligan that the government knew that information in the iraq dossier to be false .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2003 british government cleared of “ sexing up ” dossier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no sex please , we 're british the committee investigating the british government ’ s role in the alleged exaggeration of iraq ’ s military capabilities has cleared the government , but not without harsh criticism of its defense secretary . the intelligence and security committee -lrb- isc -rrb- in charge of investigating claims that the british government embellished details in its iraq dossier to strengthen its case for war , has said that the government report on saddam hussein ’ s weapons of mass destruction had not been deliberately “ sexed up ” by former director of communications alistair campbell or “ anyone else . ” thursday 's announcement marked the second time in recent months the government has been exonerated of any wrong-doing in the management of the iraq dossier .
back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”
hoon responded by addressing the house of commons on thursday , telling parliament that he had no intention of being anything other than “ open and straightforward ” with the committee and that he regretted any misunderstanding that might have arisen .
“ i hope the committee accepts that i did not in fact mislead them , ” he said .
calls for defense minister to resign his statement failed to convince the head of the opposition , iain duncan smith , who once again called on hoon to resign .
the conservative leader , who had already raised the subject of hoon stepping down over his department ’ s involvement in the scandal surrounding the apparent suicide of weapons expert dr. david kelly , addressed parliament , saying : “ geoff hoon has got to go , i 'm afraid .
either he should resign or the prime minister should dismiss him at once . ”
“ i think this report is a damning report of the secretary of state -lrb- for defense -rrb- .
the committee has accused him of misleading and withholding information . ...
my concern right now is that we have troops in iraq whose lives are at risk under the authority of the secretary of state . ”
foreign secretary jack straw defended his colleague when he addressed reporters following the publication of the committee ’ s report : " i 'm in no doubt the defense secretary should and will continue in his post .
he has every confidence of the prime minister . "
ministry of defense faces further scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons advisor .
the ministry of defense is currently also under pressure from a further inquiry , headed by appeals judge , lord hutton .
the hutton inquiry surrounds the suicide of dr. kelly and the alleged link to claims by the bbc journalist andrew gilligan that the government knew that information in the iraq dossier to be false .
dr. kelly was named as the source of gilligan ’ s claims on july 9 , nine days before his body was found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de will hutton inquiry leave a political body trail ?

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .

the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .

cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq . " that job seems to involve , according to the draft resolution from washington , the u.s.-appointed iraqi governing council cooperating with the united nations and u.s. officials in baghdad to produce " a timetable and program for the drafting of a new constitution for iraq and for the holding of democratic elections . " faster timetable to stability and sovereignty however , it does not satisfy the germans , french or russians due to the lack of time frame the three countries believe is needed to bring rapid stability to iraq .
they contend that the u.s. draft leaves key decision making in the hands of the iraqi governing council , which has taken months to form a cabinet .
germany , france and russia want a much faster timetable than the u.s. plan would provide . their amendments call for immediately “ initiating under the auspices of the u.n. a new process leading ... to the full restoration of iraqi authority ” and for an interim iraqi administration to take control of “ all civilian areas , including control over natural resources and use of international assistance . ” fischer calls for strategic reorientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell , left , and joschka fischer .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing .

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .

the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign .

" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .

" suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .
representing this interest and paying the price - that is what german foreign policy has learned . ute thofern-dieste send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is europe prepared for the inevitable ?

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .
but much of the interest focused on radical islamic terrorism in the name of allah rather than the daily lives of germany ’ s muslims .
and that ’ s a trend that gets under the skin of many young muslims in germany .
" i ’ ve noticed that this has awakened an interest that ’ s going in the wrong direction , " comments a muslim pedagogy student in cologne .
" we ’ ve been living here for 40 years , we muslims , maybe even longer , and everything that ’ s being shown in the media is stuff that has no place in muslim culture : words like ‘ terror ’ and ‘ bombing attacks . ’
they aren ’ t actually showing what actual islam is about . "
a religion under investigation shortly after the sept .
11 attacks , the german government strengthened its domestic security laws in order to make it easier to catch potential terrorists before they act .
initially , the central council of muslims supported the legislation - including measures to investigate students in germany with arab origins .
but now elyas is critical of the actions of some security officials .
" there have been an unceasing number of mistakes , " elyas says .
" mosques have been searched during friday prayers , mosques have been searched with boot-wearing officials , sometimes in the middle of the night . "
he said such incidents created a " difficult situation " for germany ’ s law-abiding muslim residents .
" they ask themselves why they are forced to suffer .
just because we ’ re muslim ?
despite the fact that we stand behind this nation and its constitution ? "
he added that the searches had weakened german muslims ' level of trust in the government .
in the city-state of berlin , home to 140,000 muslims , officials have taken steps to avoid similar culturally-insensitive mishaps .
" here in berlin we conduct ourselves with a certain sensitivity to this issue , " says günter piening , the city government ’ s commissioner for integration .
" our office also tries to take up these issues through seminars and sensibility training for police .
but i also think there ’ s a huge need for police to deepen ties with the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community .
that said , given the large and long-term presence of the -lrb- muslim -rrb- community here , good cooperation already exists between police and the community . "
persisting prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unfortunately , the sensitivity measures taken up by the government often don ’ t make the leap into german households .
many germans ’ view of islam is shaded by images of the violence carried out in the name of the religion , the oppression of women in countries like saudi arabia or iran and the intolerance shown by religious extremists toward members of other religions or , more generally , western values .
such images can engender fear and resentment as well as sweeping prejudices about islam and muslims .
" they are - well , i wouldn ’ t exactly say resentments or prejudices - but they are some kind of obstacle that are very difficult for people to overcome , " says mehmet aksar , who handles community relations for the turkish islamic culture association in bonn .
" maybe we need to help people along . "
most , by now , have recognized that the two sides must meet each other at the halfway point .
it ’ s also the responsibility of the muslim community to engage more actively in public life in order to impart their viewpoint .
" my wish would be that the people , especially muslims , would participate more actively in politics and other issues in order to take their rights more seriously and , perhaps , enforce them , " says asksar .
" right now nobody ’ s doing that .
people are doing too little to raise attention to themselves .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .
a broad consensus for the work of the bundeswehr in afghanistan is in germany 's interest , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghanistan - " dangerous deployment for several years " german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .

investigations into the roots of 9/11 terror and islamic extremism in germany have made life harder for the country ’ s 3.2 million muslims and engendered distrust of the government . in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , many germans grew distrustful of the millions of muslims living here .
the news that a hamburg-based terror cell planned the attacks only served to fuel those sentiments .
" just after the attacks , the atmosphere here was very tense , " recalls nadeem elyas , who heads the central council of muslims in germany .
not a day went by , it seemed , without new reports of people and mosques connected with the hamburg group that plotted the deaths of thousands in the world trade center , pentagon and the four hijacked planes used in the most deadly terrorist attack ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferestha ludin " many muslims were threatened - even with death threats - people were cursed at on the streets , and children and women with head scarves especially suffered . "
the threats weren ’ t just directed at people , but also at numerous german islamic institutions .
in some incidents , radicals attacked mosques .
" those incidents happened directly after -lrb- sept .
11 -rrb- ; and afterwards there was a big wave of solidarity that gave us hope , " elyas recalls .
greater interest in islam followed that wave , with germans seeking to learn more about their muslim neighbors .
building a cultural bridge that interest sparked a number of projects that sought to build an intercultural dialogue between christians and muslims .
churches , communities and universities organized speaking circles , forums and podium discussions with muslim guests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kreuzberg neighborhood is home to thousands of turks .
suddenly , germans began to take a closer look at their neighbors , including the 3.2 million people of islamic faith living here .
for more than four decades , muslims - largely from turkey - have established lives and families in germany .
though many came as immigrants themselves , a good percentage of the country ’ s muslims are children of workers who came to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii .
more than 300,000 of germany ’ s muslims are also citizens .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .
the three countries actively opposed washington 's campaign to wage war in the run up to the invasion of iraq . eu still divided on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana adresses the media after a general .
the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .
the u.s. deputy ambassador to the un james cunningham refused to comment directly on the amendments but instead remained focussed on the immense task of bringing the international community together on the best course of action in iraq . amendments not the focus for geneva bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations building in new york .
cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq . " that job seems to involve , according to the draft resolution from washington , the u.s.-appointed iraqi governing council cooperating with the united nations and u.s. officials in baghdad to produce " a timetable and program for the drafting of a new constitution for iraq and for the holding of democratic elections . " faster timetable to stability and sovereignty however , it does not satisfy the germans , french or russians due to the lack of time frame the three countries believe is needed to bring rapid stability to iraq .
they contend that the u.s. draft leaves key decision making in the hands of the iraqi governing council , which has taken months to form a cabinet .
germany , france and russia want a much faster timetable than the u.s. plan would provide . their amendments call for immediately “ initiating under the auspices of the u.n. a new process leading ... to the full restoration of iraqi authority ” and for an interim iraqi administration to take control of “ all civilian areas , including control over natural resources and use of international assistance . ” fischer calls for strategic reorientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell , left , and joschka fischer .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has made it clear that france and germany will continue to press for a change of strategy .
“ it is important now that we introduce a strategic re-orientation , ” said fischer .
“ only then will we be able to achieve peace in iraq .
it is a priority for us to restore iraqi sovereignty and a legitimate iraqi government as quickly as possible in order to establish security and stability that give iraqis a new perspective . ” while the germans , french and russians are united in their call for the united nations to assist the governing council in developing a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections , the russians do n't go as far in demanding the immediate handover of authority to iraqis . powell dismisses amendments u.s. secretary of state colin powell immediately ridiculed the idea in an interview with the arabic television channel al-jazeera on wednesday night .
powell argued that suggestions that all the united states would have to do was to find an iraqi who was passing by and give him the government were not acceptable . he added that it was also ludicrous and unfeasible for anyone to demand that american representative paul bremer and the coalition forces leave iraq at this point in time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .
the three countries actively opposed washington 's campaign to wage war in the run up to the invasion of iraq . eu still divided on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana adresses the media after a general .
the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .
the u.s. deputy ambassador to the un james cunningham refused to comment directly on the amendments but instead remained focussed on the immense task of bringing the international community together on the best course of action in iraq . amendments not the focus for geneva bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations building in new york .
cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq . " that job seems to involve , according to the draft resolution from washington , the u.s.-appointed iraqi governing council cooperating with the united nations and u.s. officials in baghdad to produce " a timetable and program for the drafting of a new constitution for iraq and for the holding of democratic elections . " faster timetable to stability and sovereignty however , it does not satisfy the germans , french or russians due to the lack of time frame the three countries believe is needed to bring rapid stability to iraq .
they contend that the u.s. draft leaves key decision making in the hands of the iraqi governing council , which has taken months to form a cabinet .
germany , france and russia want a much faster timetable than the u.s. plan would provide . their amendments call for immediately “ initiating under the auspices of the u.n. a new process leading ... to the full restoration of iraqi authority ” and for an interim iraqi administration to take control of “ all civilian areas , including control over natural resources and use of international assistance . ” fischer calls for strategic reorientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell , left , and joschka fischer .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has made it clear that france and germany will continue to press for a change of strategy .
“ it is important now that we introduce a strategic re-orientation , ” said fischer .
“ only then will we be able to achieve peace in iraq .
it is a priority for us to restore iraqi sovereignty and a legitimate iraqi government as quickly as possible in order to establish security and stability that give iraqis a new perspective . ” while the germans , french and russians are united in their call for the united nations to assist the governing council in developing a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections , the russians do n't go as far in demanding the immediate handover of authority to iraqis . powell dismisses amendments u.s. secretary of state colin powell immediately ridiculed the idea in an interview with the arabic television channel al-jazeera on wednesday night .
powell argued that suggestions that all the united states would have to do was to find an iraqi who was passing by and give him the government were not acceptable . he added that it was also ludicrous and unfeasible for anyone to demand that american representative paul bremer and the coalition forces leave iraq at this point in time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

11 emancipated german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder and french president chirac have been vocal critics of washington 's iraq policies .
after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy . " things will never be the same again . "
this was the most frequently uttered sentence in the confusing aftermath of sept .
11 .
it 's a sentence that also applies to german foreign policy .
germany has become very poised in its foreign policy decisions .
it has not only learned to confidently say " yes " without limitations , but for the first time also articulated a very clear " no . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder uncompromisingly pressed parliament for german military deployment in afghanistan .
he disciplined the coalition factions with the question of confidence : members of parliament had to agree , otherwise the continuity of the government would be threatened .
a year later : just as uncompromising was schröder 's rejection of military action in iraq , regardless of its justification .
unlimited solidarity with the united states on one hand , total refusal on the other hand .
as paradoxical as it may sound , each depends on the other .
both decisions were based on an emancipation process , showing the steadfastness of schröder 's government .
schröder entered the chancellery with the declared goal of turning a reunified germany into a " normal country " .
in all composure , a new generation of politicians saw themselves as representatives of germany , because they were no longer the ones carrying the massive burden of crimes committed during the nazi era .
a stronger international role for germany , with all its rights and obligations , was also part of this .
this new self-confidence first had to be pushed and anchored in domestic politics .
it was a agonizing process , especially for government parties with pacifist traditions , and ultimately for chancellor schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer themselves .
the schröder-fischer team began with the difficult decision for war in kosovo .
two years later , the tedious row over military action in macedonia showed how difficult it was to bear the new responsibilities in foreign policy .
september 11 then became as a severe catalyst .
the government found itself before the necessity of acting quickly and convincingly , and it did not hesitate for long .
the rigor with which schröder forced the government factions to support military action in afghanistan finally gave him the ineradicable freedom to act in foreign politics .
germany proved itself to be a reliable alliance partner and thus created the conditions for its emancipation from the united states .
german foreign policy matured at a time-lapse pace , not in a planned process .
but this pace also engendered recognizable strategic deficits .
far too many decisions , especially the schröder 's , were borne of necessity or made spontaneously .
during the election campaign , the staging of resistance to war in iraq as an absolute refusal was a mistake that prevented all further exertion of influence .
the government should have yielded its increased power in foreign matters much more intelligently .
german criticism would have been taken more seriously had it not shut all the doors of diplomacy .
the fact that relations to the united states will not remain disturbed in the long term is ultimately owed to the course of postwar developments and mistakes on the part of the u.s. government .
u.s. president george w. bush , as can already be determined , has accepted the fact that he still needs his german allies .
what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .

what also should be considered is the fact that this acceptance may not have been possible without germany 's past input .
germany 's activities in kosovo , macedonia and afghanistan had already proved that it can shoulder and bear international responsibility .
germany will also play a role in the reconstruction of iraq because it is in germany 's interest .
representing this interest and paying the price - that is what german foreign policy has learned . ute thofern-dieste send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is europe prepared for the inevitable ?

but the calls for a more rapid handover of power to iraqis and the un have been dismissed by the u.s. as unfeasible . united nations secretary-general kofi annan has called the permanent members of the security council to a meeting in geneva on saturday to try and unite the united states , russia , china , britain and france behind a plan to stabilize iraq .
what he didn ’ t foresee was a list of amendments to a u.s. draft resolution put forward by france and germany being handed to him as he tried to rally the veto-wielding council members into an agreement . topping the list of demands germany and france passed on to annan on wednesday was the desire for more power to be transferred to the iraqis and the united nations in running the country than washington currently desires . though germany is not a permanent member of the security council – it is currently sitting on the council as part of a two-year invitation - its inclusion in the preparation of amendments alongside such influential council powers as france and russia will still carry weight due to its position within the european union and its influence over other nations .
the three countries actively opposed washington 's campaign to wage war in the run up to the invasion of iraq . eu still divided on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana adresses the media after a general .
the stance of both germany and france seems to be indicative of a general uncertainty over u.s. plans for the future of iraq within the european union .
the eu ’ s foreign policy chief , javier solana , told the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee on wednesday that the 15 eu nations were still “ a long way from achieving consensus both among ourselves and with other members of the security council . ” chancellor gerhard schröder has closely coordinated his policy on iraq with the french president jaques chirac and both leaders rejected the united states call for a multinational un force to take the strain off coalition forces in iraq .
it was then that german and french diplomats started to work hard together on their proposed amendments . these were passed onto u.s. officials at the un in new york on wednesday .
the u.s. deputy ambassador to the un james cunningham refused to comment directly on the amendments but instead remained focussed on the immense task of bringing the international community together on the best course of action in iraq . amendments not the focus for geneva bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations building in new york .
cunningham said in a statement that the geneva meeting would not focus on the amendment text but on what must be done to get the international community to come together " to get the job that we want done in iraq . " that job seems to involve , according to the draft resolution from washington , the u.s.-appointed iraqi governing council cooperating with the united nations and u.s. officials in baghdad to produce " a timetable and program for the drafting of a new constitution for iraq and for the holding of democratic elections . " faster timetable to stability and sovereignty however , it does not satisfy the germans , french or russians due to the lack of time frame the three countries believe is needed to bring rapid stability to iraq .
they contend that the u.s. draft leaves key decision making in the hands of the iraqi governing council , which has taken months to form a cabinet .
germany , france and russia want a much faster timetable than the u.s. plan would provide . their amendments call for immediately “ initiating under the auspices of the u.n. a new process leading ... to the full restoration of iraqi authority ” and for an interim iraqi administration to take control of “ all civilian areas , including control over natural resources and use of international assistance . ” fischer calls for strategic reorientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell , left , and joschka fischer .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has made it clear that france and germany will continue to press for a change of strategy .
“ it is important now that we introduce a strategic re-orientation , ” said fischer .
“ only then will we be able to achieve peace in iraq .
it is a priority for us to restore iraqi sovereignty and a legitimate iraqi government as quickly as possible in order to establish security and stability that give iraqis a new perspective . ” while the germans , french and russians are united in their call for the united nations to assist the governing council in developing a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections , the russians do n't go as far in demanding the immediate handover of authority to iraqis . powell dismisses amendments u.s. secretary of state colin powell immediately ridiculed the idea in an interview with the arabic television channel al-jazeera on wednesday night .
powell argued that suggestions that all the united states would have to do was to find an iraqi who was passing by and give him the government were not acceptable . he added that it was also ludicrous and unfeasible for anyone to demand that american representative paul bremer and the coalition forces leave iraq at this point in time . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.n. passes new iraq resolution , but its role remains unchanged the u.n. security council thursday adopted a resolution welcoming the establishment of the u.s.-formed interim authority in iraq , but stopped short of increasing the u.n. ’ s role as opponents to the war in iraq requested .

back in july , a house of commons committee cleared the governement of misleading the public in the run up to the war in iraq . the isc said on thursday that the dossier , which formed the government ’ s cornerstone argument for taking military action against iraq , had not been exaggerated .
still , the committee criticized 10 downing street for its inclusion of the claim that saddam hussein could fire banned chemical and biological weapons at 45 minutes notice , which it said was “ unhelpful and potentially misleading . ”
although the committee all but cleared the government of deliberate manipulation of the facts included in the iraq report , it maintained that its claims in the september 2002 dossier did not give a “ balanced view . ”
statement lacked context “ the 45 minutes claim , included four times , was always likely to attract attention because it was arresting detail that the public had not seen before , ” the report said .
“ as the 45 minutes claim was new to its readers , context of the intelligence and any assessment needed to be explained , ” the isc statement read .
it added : “ the fact that it was assessed to refer to battlefield chemical and biological munitions and their movement on the battlefield , not to any other form of chemical or biological attack , should have been highlighted in the dossier .
the omission of the context and the assessment allowed speculation as to its exact meaning .
this was unhelpful to an understanding of the issue . ”
the isc , made up of ministers from the governing labor party , the conservative opposition and the liberal party , laid the blame for the misleading information firmly at the door of the ministry of defense and its chief , geoff hoon , who was criticized for not disclosing full details of his staff 's concerns over the dossier .
hoon accused of misleading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
hoon has been accused of misleading the first session of the committee ’ s hearing in july by not revealing the feelings of those in the defense ministry who were uncomfortable about the inclusion of the disputed 45 minute claim .
committee chairwoman ann taylor told reporters hoon was " potentially misleading " in his evidence in july but that he did not lie to the committee .
“ he did not tell us lies , ” she told the bbc .
“ it was potentially misleading , events overtook it . ...
we got the information in the end .
it is speculative -lrb- to ask -rrb- what might have happened . ”
hoon responded by addressing the house of commons on thursday , telling parliament that he had no intention of being anything other than “ open and straightforward ” with the committee and that he regretted any misunderstanding that might have arisen .
“ i hope the committee accepts that i did not in fact mislead them , ” he said .
calls for defense minister to resign his statement failed to convince the head of the opposition , iain duncan smith , who once again called on hoon to resign .
the conservative leader , who had already raised the subject of hoon stepping down over his department ’ s involvement in the scandal surrounding the apparent suicide of weapons expert dr. david kelly , addressed parliament , saying : “ geoff hoon has got to go , i 'm afraid .
either he should resign or the prime minister should dismiss him at once . ”
“ i think this report is a damning report of the secretary of state -lrb- for defense -rrb- .
the committee has accused him of misleading and withholding information . ...
my concern right now is that we have troops in iraq whose lives are at risk under the authority of the secretary of state . ”
foreign secretary jack straw defended his colleague when he addressed reporters following the publication of the committee ’ s report : " i 'm in no doubt the defense secretary should and will continue in his post .
he has every confidence of the prime minister . "
ministry of defense faces further scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons advisor .
the ministry of defense is currently also under pressure from a further inquiry , headed by appeals judge , lord hutton .
the hutton inquiry surrounds the suicide of dr. kelly and the alleged link to claims by the bbc journalist andrew gilligan that the government knew that information in the iraq dossier to be false .
dr. kelly was named as the source of gilligan ’ s claims on july 9 , nine days before his body was found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de will hutton inquiry leave a political body trail ?

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission .

" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .
his election campaign vow in august 2002 that no german troops would set foot on iraqi soil as part of a u.s. military invasion apparently shut down communication between the white house and chancellery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injured u.s. soldier being evaucated from iraq until recently .
the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign . " redefinition " of the relationship talk instead is of increasing the € 75 million -lrb- $ 84 million -rrb- financial aid package to iraq and offering german law enforcement expertise to train iraqi policemen , perhaps in germany . it is part of what german politicians , like foreign minister joschka fischer , are calling a " redefinition " of the transatlantic relationship .
" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .
a poll by the transatlantic organization the german marshall fund released september 4 revealed that one in every two germans thought u.s. world leadership was " undesirable . "
such sentiments were even stronger in italy and france , which announced wednesday it had drafted a new security council resolution for postwar iraq together with germany . iraq resolution defines relationship the resolution calls for the united nations to take over political responsibility in postwar iraq , a point to which the bush administration remains opposed .
secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with arabic television channel al-jazeera this week that the u.s.-appointed civil administrator of iraq , paul bremer , should continue to play the dominant role . " suggestions that all we have to do is get up tomorrow morning and find an iraqi who is passing by and give him the government and say , ' you 're now in charge and ambassador bremer and the american army are leaving , ' that 's not an acceptable solution , " powell said , according to reuters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many .

since the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , germany 's relationship with america has experienced highs and lows .
the current debate on a un resolution for iraq shows how much the transatlantic relationship has changed . in a few weeks , chancellor gerhard schröder will speak before the united nations general assembly in new york at a time when his and other countries are pushing for a greater role for the world body in postwar iraq . a security council resolution on cooperation between the united states and the united nations in the war-torn country will likely top the agenda .
but a planned meeting between schröder and american president george w. bush on the periphery will also be given particular importance in germany . the one-on-one meeting between the two leaders , which u.s. ambassador to germany daniel coats told german radio thursday is " very likely " to happen , will be the first since bush visited berlin in may 2002 .
back then , bush praised schröder 's government for their commitment to rooting out terrorist cells in germany and sending troops to africa and afghanistan as part of america 's " war on terror . " back then schröder was still talking of " unlimited solidarity " with the united states following the devastating terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c. on september 11 , 2001 . but the niceties and promises by bush to take schröder fishing one day quickly evaporated as the german chancellor came out hard on the bush administration 's planned invasion of iraq .

the daily guerrilla and suicide attacks against u.s. and british troops in iraq have led the bush administration to appeal worldwide for help in stabilizing postwar iraq .
germany still refuses to send soldiers and politicians have said the country wo n't practice the sort of " blank check " diplomacy that saw the kohl government spending 17 billion german marks -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in 1991 to finance america 's first desert campaign .

" we need to meet in the middle , " he said in an interview with stern magazine this week . germany is no longer an unquestioning ally to the united states .
the two years since the september 11 attacks have proven that . the bush administration 's invasion of iraq damaged not only the relationship between the two leaders but also largely erased the vast pool of sympathetic feelings many germans harboured for americans following the destruction of the world trade center in new york . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin teenage students protest against war in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin thursday march 20 , 2003 .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .
u.n. secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai say a larger mission is needed to bring security to parts of afghanistan dominated by tribal warlords . but as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld pointed out on his recent visit to afghanistan , many western countries are reluctant to commit more troops .
" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .
a broad consensus for the work of the bundeswehr in afghanistan is in germany 's interest , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghanistan - " dangerous deployment for several years " german defense minister struck has confirmed afghanistan , though “ dangerous ” , will be the new focal point for future foreign military deployments and german troops will be reduced in the balkans .

german defense minister peter struck announced he will send a small contingent of bundeswehr soldiers to afghanistan look at expanding the mandate beyond kabul causing an uproar in parliament . a week after germany 's cabinet agreed to expand the bundeswehr 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan beyond kabul , the country 's defense minister said an advance team of troops will soon be on its way to the city of kunduz . the soldiers will examine the area around the northern city in preparation for the possible expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- mission , which is still waiting on united nations and nato approval . while being critcized by opposition politicians for moving too quickly , struck said he wanted to get the team to kunduz before the arrival of the harsh afghan winter . germany wants to eventually deploy a provisional reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- of between 230 and 450 troops in kunduz .
though nato recently took over command from the u.n. of the 5,000-strong multinational force , germany 's constitution requires that the united nations vote to expand the mandate before it can commit more soldiers to the nato mission . " this matter is being looked at inside nato , and we 'll be looking for some military advice on how feasible that may be , " said nato secretary general george robertson . reluctance to commit more troops german foreign minister joschka fischer has added his voice to the widespread calls for nato to expand isaf beyond kabul .

" for whatever reason , there have not been countries lining up to expand isaf , " rumsfeld said , though he added that " an expansion of isaf would be a good thing . " the german advance team in kunduz will be acting under the assumption that an approved isaf expansion wo n't be far off . according to struck , they 'll be checking if the present infrastructure being used by u.s. troops can be taken over , drawing up security plans for buildings in the area , and deciding how much logistical support is needed . opposition angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck struck 's -lrb- photo -rrb- announcement caused an uproar in the german parliament , with the opposition accusing him of racing ahead with the plans before parliament had given its approval . fischer was also challenged to explain why he has reversed his earlier position to now come out in favor of the expansion of isaf . fischer responded to the criticism by saying that both he and struck had carefully considered the opinions expressed by the opposition .

the deal - which took weeks to negotiate - means that argentina will only have to pay interest on its $ 21bn -lrb- £ 13bn -rrb- of debt for the next three years .
the deal , formally approved by president nestor kirchner late on wednesday , comes just a day after the country defaulted on a $ 2.9bn debt payment due to the imf .

" i am pleased to welcome president krichner 's announcement of argentina 's economic programme that aims at restoring strong economic growth and reducing poverty , " said imf chief horst koehler .

two sticking points had been the imf demands that banks be compensated for last year 's collapse in the value of the peso , and that utility prices must rise .
the agreement did not set a deadline for either of these two issues .

dearborn 's muslim have been subject to new scrutiny the shops seem to sell everything that a middle eastern immigrant could want to feel at home - halal meat , pastries , hookah pipes and even books - which is as it should be since dearborn is home to the largest concentration of arab-americans in the united states .
no-one here had anything to do with the 11 september attacks , but two years on the events of that fateful morning have energised many in the community who feel that they need not to defend islam , but to explain it .
over a meal of spicy potatoes , fattouche and shish kebab , washed down with lebanese cocktails i met five young muslims who live in dearborn and whose attitudes to life have been changed in various ways since mohammed atta and his henchmen killed more than 3,000 people .
need to explain ibrahim kadiri , 20 , expresses the overwhelming sentiment of the group : tall and shy he nevertheless gets passionate when he talks about what happened on 11 september , 2001 .

the charity said about 1 % of callouts are being delayed because of low crew numbers .

they are holding a special recruitment night at the lifeboat station on thursday .

crew member liz davidson , a pension manager , said : " they do n't have to be salty sea dogs with captain birdseye beards as we really do come from a wide variety of backgrounds . "
the current crew includes a computer engineer , a car brake specialist , a road traffic surveyor , a housewife and a college lecturer in chemistry .
ms davidson said : " we intend to dispel other common misconceptions that volunteers need a nautical knowledge , that they need to have been on a boat before , that they have to be male , a good swimmer , a first-aider , a member of the rnli or even that they need to know someone in the existing crew .
" with retirals and for other reasons the need to recruit is becoming particularly important . "
she said that the first class training will be given to any volunteer who lives or works in the local area , is medically fit , is aged between 17 and 44 and is committed to the role .

" due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding , we have decided to postpone the date , " they said in a joint statement .
" when we found ourselves seriously contemplating hiring three separate ' decoy brides ' at three different locations , we realised that something was awry , " the statement added .
the wedding will be the third for lopez , 33 , and the first for affleck , 31 , who met while making the film gigli , which was panned by critics and bombed at the box office .
secret plans the pair had tried to keep the precise location of their wedding secret , but following a series of leaks the media had pinpointed a private estate in the santa barbara hills , just north of los angeles as the place .
as a result , the seaside town has been deluged with reporters and tv crews all keen to get a slice of the action .
we began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised lopez-affleck statement hollywood 's wedding battles sources close to the couple insist that they remain as close as ever and the nuptials have merely been postponed - not cancelled altogether .
" we began to feel that the spirit of what should have been the happiest day of our lives could be compromised .
we felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us , our families and our friends , " the couple 's statement said .
false trail ?
there has been some speculation that the statement may itself be part of a ruse designed to throw the media off the scent - a charge lopez 's spokesman denies : " i do n't see that as even remotely possible , " dan klores told the reuters news agency , adding that guests - believed to number some 400 - were being called to tell them the wedding was off .
according to various media reports the guests were all invited over the telephone rather than in writing , and not given specific details until the last minute in an effort to keep the event secret .
the guests , including matt damon , matthew perry , bruce willis and jack nicholson , were only told to be in los angeles on saturday and that they would be shuttled to the wedding from there .
there has been intense media speculation over the actual venue for ceremony .
however , it seems that the cat may have finally been let out of the bag when a woman informant claimed that the wedding would be held in the luxurious biltmore hotel .
the woman said that her own daughter was getting married at the hotel on the same day and that her wedding party had been told it would be necessary for their guest to carry their invitations at all times to avoid being mistaken for gatecrashers at the lopez-affleck wedding .

not that delegates at the world trade summit are likely to get much time to enjoy it .
instead they are spending the best part of five days - more if the meeting overruns - in an anonymous air-conditioned conference centre ; a building that could frankly be anywhere .
there are demonstrators in the city , denouncing the world trade organisation 's trade liberalisation agenda .
but nobody expects them to disrupt the business - which the protesters did succeed in doing when the wto met in seattle in 1999 .
the resort area where the meetings are being held is on a narrow strip of land connected to the mainland at both ends , with a lagoon in between .
and that makes it relatively easy for the security forces to seal the area off from the protesters , although there are plenty of tourists around sharing hotels with delegates and journalists .
sleepless nights the participants are more likely to have been alarmed by crocodile warnings along the lagoon than they are to have been troubled by the protests .
the mood among delegates seems to be reasonably upbeat , although they know they are looking at a tough few days , and probably some sleepless nights towards the end as well .
they have been told by the wto director general supachai panitchpadki that they need to reach a consensus that sets the organisation on course for completing trade liberalisation negotiations by the end of next year .
he says that a clear indication that the wto members are committed to economic growth through trade will give a boost to confidence at a time of uncertainty about the global economy .
and he says they can make a contribution to international effort to tackle poverty .
so there is a lot at stake .
vague definitions delegates are also acutely aware of the succession of missed deadlines for interim outline agreements .
but what eases the pressure a little is the fact that meeting is not one with what wto chief spokesman keith rockwell calls a ' binary outcome ' - one that either fails to launch a new round of trade talks , as seattle did in 1999 , or succeeds in doing so like doha nearly two years ago .
success or failure here will be a much vaguer question of whether cancun gives the negotiations new momentum .
ambitions have been significantly scaled down .
in agriculture there was supposed be an agreement on the real numbers - overall targets for cuts in subsidies and tariffs by the rich countries , by the end of march .
now even some countries that are exerting the greatest pressure on the european union and japan seem to accept that those hard numbers wo n't be agreed here .
so with the more modest and subjective aspirations that wto members have for this meeting - it should be possible for anyone who wants to claim victory .

not that delegates at the world trade summit are likely to get much time to enjoy it .
instead they are spending the best part of five days - more if the meeting overruns - in an anonymous air-conditioned conference centre ; a building that could frankly be anywhere .
there are demonstrators in the city , denouncing the world trade organisation 's trade liberalisation agenda .
but nobody expects them to disrupt the business - which the protesters did succeed in doing when the wto met in seattle in 1999 .
the resort area where the meetings are being held is on a narrow strip of land connected to the mainland at both ends , with a lagoon in between .
and that makes it relatively easy for the security forces to seal the area off from the protesters , although there are plenty of tourists around sharing hotels with delegates and journalists .
sleepless nights the participants are more likely to have been alarmed by crocodile warnings along the lagoon than they are to have been troubled by the protests .
and they are being shielded from the riots the mood among delegates seems to be reasonably upbeat , although they know they are looking at a tough few days , and probably some sleepless nights towards the end as well .
they have been told by the wto director general supachai panitchpadki that they need to reach a consensus that sets the organisation on course for completing trade liberalisation negotiations by the end of next year .
he says that a clear indication that the wto members are committed to economic growth through trade will give a boost to confidence at a time of uncertainty about the global economy .
and he says they can make a contribution to international effort to tackle poverty .
so there is a lot at stake .
vague definitions delegates are also acutely aware of the succession of missed deadlines for interim outline agreements .
cancun 's conference centre : home for five days but what eases the pressure a little is the fact that meeting is not one with what wto chief spokesman keith rockwell calls a ' binary outcome ' - one that either fails to launch a new round of trade talks , as seattle did in 1999 , or succeeds in doing so like doha nearly two years ago .
success or failure here will be a much vaguer question of whether cancun gives the negotiations new momentum .
ambitions have been significantly scaled down .
in agriculture there was supposed be an agreement on the real numbers - overall targets for cuts in subsidies and tariffs by the rich countries , by the end of march .
now even some countries that are exerting the greatest pressure on the european union and japan seem to accept that those hard numbers wo n't be agreed here .
so with the more modest and subjective aspirations that wto members have for this meeting - it should be possible for anyone who wants to claim victory .

she said the couple separated in the spring around the time their teenage son , jack , went into a rehabilitation programme .

that he really meant it .
" and , after four days , i came back to see him .
and he was trying so hard .
so hard .

jack osbourne , who spent two months in rehabilitation for alcohol and drug abuse , acknowledged that he tried to commit suicide because he was so depressed about his mother 's colon cancer , which is now in remission .
" i attempted to overdose , " said the 17-year-old , who gained fame with the rest of his family on the mtv series the osbournes .
" take a whole bunch of pills and drink some absinthe . "

when f1 racing driver michael schumacher took part in the launch of fiat 's new panda at the frankfurt motor show , he might have done his bit to save the troubled italian car maker from extinction .
fiat auto relies heavily on its home market in italy where its market share fell 8.5 % in a year to a historic low of 28.7 % in july .
the hope now is that the car maker 's latest version of its legendary panda will once again seduce the italian people .
" panda will be important to us , for our market share , " gianni coda , president of fiat auto 's business unit fiat lancia and light commercial vehicles , told bbc news online .
improving since it was first launched in 1980 , more than five million pandas have been sold across europe .
" panda is a part of the relaunch of fiat , " mr coda said , noting that in the last couple of months the car maker has launched a range of new models .
and it seems to be working .
in august , fiat 's market share bounced back above the 30 % mark .
" we are improving our situation .
when we will start to make money , we will see in the future , " mr coda said .
trouble fiat 's difficulties have earned the company notoriety .

and fiat auto 's future remains uncertain .
fiat hopes it new panda will seduce italians on 24 january next year , an option that gives fiat the right to sell fiat auto to the automotive giant general motors kicks in .
and it is far from clear whether the option will be exercised before it expires on 25 january 2009 .
for general motors , which already owns 10 % of fiat auto , the mere existence of the option is cumbersome given fiat auto 's current weakness .
legal muddle one man who is keen to step in and sort out the mess is martin leach , who resigned from his job as chief operating officer at ford europe last month .
fiat is keen for him to take over when fiat auto 's chief executive giancarlo boschetti retires next year .
but there has been a hitch .
industry sources say mr leach 's contract with ford includes a clause that prevents him from working for another car maker right away .
" it seems mr leach 's legal people gave him some bad advice , " one fiat official told bbc news online .
personnel matter within ford , there appears to be great unease about mr leach 's departure , which came only a year after he stepped into the top job .
general motors has an option to buy fiat europe the 46-year-old executive was a ford man through and through , having spent his working life with the motor company and its subsidiaries .
" i 'm sad to see him go .
he was a good products guy , but he has to lead his own life , " mr leach 's former boss , david thursfield , ford motor company 's executive vice president , international operations and global purchasing , told bbc news online .
but when quizzed on whether ford is trying to make life even harder for fiat by refusing to let mr leach go , the response from the president and chief operating officer of ford motor company , nick scheele , was tense .
" i really think that is something that has to remain between martin leach and whoever .
i could n't comment on that .
i do n't intend to comment on personnel matter , " he said .
the contractual complications have made some industry sources question whether mr leach will ever arrive at fiat as intended .

when f1 racing driver michael schumacher took part in the launch of fiat 's new panda at the frankfurt motor show , he might have done his bit to save the troubled italian car maker from extinction .
fiat auto relies heavily on its home market in italy where its market share fell 8.5 % in a year to a historic low of 28.7 % in july .
the hope now is that the car maker 's latest version of its legendary panda will once again seduce the italian people .
" panda will be important to us , for our market share , " gianni coda , president of fiat auto 's business unit fiat lancia and light commercial vehicles , told bbc news online .
improving since it was first launched in 1980 , more than five million pandas have been sold across europe .
" panda is a part of the relaunch of fiat , " mr coda said , noting that in the last couple of months the car maker has launched a range of new models .
and it seems to be working .
in august , fiat 's market share bounced back above the 30 % mark .
" we are improving our situation .
when we will start to make money , we will see in the future , " mr coda said .
trouble fiat 's difficulties have earned the company notoriety .
last year it clocked up a net loss of 4.3bn euros , pushing its industrial parent fiat group into dire straits .
and fiat auto 's future remains uncertain .
fiat hopes it new panda will seduce italians on 24 january next year , an option that gives fiat the right to sell fiat auto to the automotive giant general motors kicks in .
and it is far from clear whether the option will be exercised before it expires on 25 january 2009 .
for general motors , which already owns 10 % of fiat auto , the mere existence of the option is cumbersome given fiat auto 's current weakness .
legal muddle one man who is keen to step in and sort out the mess is martin leach , who resigned from his job as chief operating officer at ford europe last month .
fiat is keen for him to take over when fiat auto 's chief executive giancarlo boschetti retires next year .
but there has been a hitch .
industry sources say mr leach 's contract with ford includes a clause that prevents him from working for another car maker right away .
" it seems mr leach 's legal people gave him some bad advice , " one fiat official told bbc news online .
personnel matter within ford , there appears to be great unease about mr leach 's departure , which came only a year after he stepped into the top job .
general motors has an option to buy fiat europe the 46-year-old executive was a ford man through and through , having spent his working life with the motor company and its subsidiaries .
" i 'm sad to see him go .
he was a good products guy , but he has to lead his own life , " mr leach 's former boss , david thursfield , ford motor company 's executive vice president , international operations and global purchasing , told bbc news online .
but when quizzed on whether ford is trying to make life even harder for fiat by refusing to let mr leach go , the response from the president and chief operating officer of ford motor company , nick scheele , was tense .
" i really think that is something that has to remain between martin leach and whoever .
i could n't comment on that .
i do n't intend to comment on personnel matter , " he said .
the contractual complications have made some industry sources question whether mr leach will ever arrive at fiat as intended .
last friday fiat chairman umberto agnelli stated that mr leach was certainly in the running for the job , though other possible candidates were also being considered .
