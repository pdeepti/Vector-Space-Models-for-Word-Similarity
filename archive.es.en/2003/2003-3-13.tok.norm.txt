chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .

soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .

a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .
officials of the iraqi government showed the aircraft to journalists on wednesday .
reporters seemed unimpressed with the " weapon , " with written reports describing it as what appeared to be little more than a model plane made of balsa wood held together with screws and duct tape . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british ambassador to germany : ' we share a common goal in iraq ' in an exclusive interview with dw-world , britain 's ambassador to germany explains his country 's position in the iraq conflict and its implications for german-british relations .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .

these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .
officials of the iraqi government showed the aircraft to journalists on wednesday .
reporters seemed unimpressed with the " weapon , " with written reports describing it as what appeared to be little more than a model plane made of balsa wood held together with screws and duct tape . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british ambassador to germany : ' we share a common goal in iraq ' in an exclusive interview with dw-world , britain 's ambassador to germany explains his country 's position in the iraq conflict and its implications for german-british relations .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .
police wearing flak jackets stopped and searched cars after the killing .
the government urged news organizations to stick to its line and threatened to suspend any that broke the rules .
the assassination left belgrade residents worried .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .
officials of the iraqi government showed the aircraft to journalists on wednesday .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .
police wearing flak jackets stopped and searched cars after the killing .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .

soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .
officials of the iraqi government showed the aircraft to journalists on wednesday .

and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .
police wearing flak jackets stopped and searched cars after the killing .
the government urged news organizations to stick to its line and threatened to suspend any that broke the rules .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .
officials of the iraqi government showed the aircraft to journalists on wednesday .
reporters seemed unimpressed with the " weapon , " with written reports describing it as what appeared to be little more than a model plane made of balsa wood held together with screws and duct tape . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british ambassador to germany : ' we share a common goal in iraq ' in an exclusive interview with dw-world , britain 's ambassador to germany explains his country 's position in the iraq conflict and its implications for german-british relations .

" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .
police wearing flak jackets stopped and searched cars after the killing .
the government urged news organizations to stick to its line and threatened to suspend any that broke the rules .
the assassination left belgrade residents worried .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .
officials of the iraqi government showed the aircraft to journalists on wednesday .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "

powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .
police wearing flak jackets stopped and searched cars after the killing .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .
police wearing flak jackets stopped and searched cars after the killing .
the government urged news organizations to stick to its line and threatened to suspend any that broke the rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.03.2003 iraq dispute overshadows blair-schröder meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troubled friends : british prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .

u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "

some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .

" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .

in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .

and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .

u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .

some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .
police wearing flak jackets stopped and searched cars after the killing .
the government urged news organizations to stick to its line and threatened to suspend any that broke the rules .
the assassination left belgrade residents worried .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .

chancellor gerhard schröder met with british prime minister tony blair on wednesday .
the issue at the top of their agenda : their disagreement over iraq . chancellor gerhard schröder had one of those appointments on wednesday that politicians love .
schröder traveled to london to help prime minister tony blair open an art exhibition called " the masterpieces of dresden . "
surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .
officials of the iraqi government showed the aircraft to journalists on wednesday .
reporters seemed unimpressed with the " weapon , " with written reports describing it as what appeared to be little more than a model plane made of balsa wood held together with screws and duct tape . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british ambassador to germany : ' we share a common goal in iraq ' in an exclusive interview with dw-world , britain 's ambassador to germany explains his country 's position in the iraq conflict and its implications for german-british relations .

surrounded by the works of artists like caspar david friedrich , schröder and blair had the perfect chance to show their countries ' relationship in its very best light .
but that would have been under normal circumstances .
and schröder was not making his visit under normal circumstances .
war is in the air , and the visual pleasures of the exhibition were overshadowed by the deep disagreement between the leaders - even as they tried to play down those differences on wednesday .
more united than divided " there is more that unites us than divides us , " blair told reporters .
" we 're very good friends , but we are allowed to have disagreements from time to time . "
schröder , meanwhile , gave his 10 downing street counterpart a pat on the shoulder , thanking blair for his friendship and saying he hoped it would last far longer than the current iraq crisis that has pitted them against each other .
playing off of a recent quip from u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , schröder even joked that the art the two soaked up in london was part of what unites " old europe . "
however , neither blair nor schröder was able to reach a compromise position over iraq .
" on this issue , it 's certain we will not be able to convince one another , " schröder said .
for months now , schröder and blair have argued the opposite sides of the question .
the german chancellor has refused to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraqi leader saddam hussein , and the british prime minister has stood without flinching at the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
british offer new compromise ideas before schröder arrived on wednesday , blair worked to find a diplomatic compromise that would end the conflict , which has damaged german-british ties and threatens the future of the u.n. security council .
the latest fissures were created on monday when russia and france announced they would use their ultimate power in the council - the veto - to derail an effort by the united states , britain and spain to push through a resolution that gives saddam a deadline of next monday to disarm .
blair , who needs a second resolution to shore up his eroding public support at home , has put together a six-point plan that he hopes the united nations will embrace in a new resolution .
the resolution foresees an ultimatum that would give saddam until march 27 to comply with " benchmarks . "
a british foreign office official , mike o 'brien , said on wednesday that these benchmarks would include : - a television appearance by saddam in which he renounces weapons of mass destruction . - iraqi permission for 30 key weapons scientists to travel to cyprus where the could be interviewed by u.n. weapons inspectors . - destruction " forthwith " of 10,000 liters of anthrax and other chemical and biological weapons iraq is allegedly holding . - an official iraqi explanation for an aerial drone recently discovered by u.n. weapons inspectors .
vote on new resolution put off in new york , members of the security council worked on wednesday to turn blair 's outline into an acceptable compromise .
a vote on the plan had been planned for friday .
but diplomats said it was likely to be delayed again .
during a tense three-hour meeting of the bitterly divided council , britain offered to abandon the monday ultimatum if members approved its list of disarmament tests for saddam .
the resolution would then implicitly threaten iraq with " serious consequences " if it failed to comply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremy greenstock " this is a trial balloon , if you like , to see whether this is a way out of our current difficulties ... to see if we can keep the council together , " said britain 's u.n. ambassador , jeremy greenstock -lrb- photo -rrb- .
u.s. ambassador john negroponte said the united states wanted to see how members reacted to the plan " before we embrace it in its entirety . "
if the council starts to rally around the so-called benchmarks , negroponte said , the united states would be prepared to accept " a very , very , very brief extension " of the deadline for iraq to complete the disarmament tests .
the discussions are being conducted under a veto threat made by france and russia , both of which want to grant extra time to u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq .
both countries indicated on wednesday that the british proposal did not change their position .
" it 's still about war and peace , " said russia 's u.n. ambassador , sergey lavrov .
" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .

soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .

" we are not convinced that this proposal takes care of our concerns .
we will study it , but we see automaticity still there . "
french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said the british proposal did n't change the draft resolution , " which authorizes the use of force — this is what is at stake . "
members will meet again on thursday at 3 p.m.
est on the new british proposal .
some envoys said the battle could end with the united states , britain and spain abandoning the process rather than facing the humiliation of a defeat if the measure were put to a vote .
because of the veto threat , some u.s. and british officials said they would consider it a victory if the resolution achieved the minimum nine votes for passage .
u.s. officials said they were within close range of getting nine votes but six undecided nations on the council did not confirm it .
rumsfeld says u.s. could act alone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld the british effort was launched a day after rumsfeld -lrb- photo -rrb- suggested that the bush administration was prepared to invade iraq without british support if necessary .
" what will ultimately be decided is unclear as to their role ; that is to say , their role in the event a decision is made to use force , " rumsfeld said .
soon afterward , rumsfeld backtracked on his comments and said he still expected british support .
" in the event that a decision to use force is made , we have every reason to believe there will be a significant military contribution from the united kingdom , " rumsfeld said .
in response to rumsfeld 's first statement , blair told parliament on wednesday : " of course , it is true that the united states could go alone , and , of course , this country should not take military action unless it is in our interest to do so .
" what is at stake here is not whether the united states goes alone or not , it is whether the international community is prepared to back up the clear instruction it gave to saddam hussein with the necessary action .
the best thing is to go flat-out for that second resolution . "
in iraq , the government moved to answer questions about the drone that were raised by u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
powell said this week that the drone with a wing span of more than 24 feet could be used to drop chemical and biological agents .
officials of the iraqi government showed the aircraft to journalists on wednesday .

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic , assassinated on wednesday , lived and governed in a land of violent crime .
the government is blaming organized crime for the killing . the international police official , versed in the violent perils of serbian life , made sure that prime minister zoran djindjic knew he could become a marked man long before two sniper bullets ended the leader 's life on wednesday .
" i warned the new government that they would have many problems with the old organization , with the interlocking relationship between criminals and police , " said marko nicovic , a serb who is a vice chief at interpol .
" i also warned prime minister djindjic that he , too , would become a target at the moment he touched the interests of these people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic actually , djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- did not need a warning to know that serbia was a deadly dangerous place to live and govern .
drive-by shootings , explosions and mafia-style shootouts are commonplace in the country , which still is recovering from the 13-year rule of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
" dark forces who have mushroomed in the country since the 1990s are trying to turn back the clock , " said dobrivoje radovanovic , an independent crime expert .
killings go back to 1996 those forces began exacting their bloody toll in 1996 after the horrors of the balkan wars were finally stopped by the international community .
since then , nearly 10 high-ranking police and security officials have been slain .
the toll has extended beyond the government 's upper circle as well .
the victims also included zeljko raznatovic , a feared serbian paramilitary leader under indictment for war crimes who was shot to death in a hotel lobby in belgrade in january 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic as the victims fell , serbs suspected that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- may have been one of the forces behind the attacks .
but the killings continued after djindjic and thousands of others drove milosevic from power in october 2000 .
these attacks have claimed the lives of monir gavrilovic , a former serbian secret police official , and of gen. bosko buha , the deputy chief of serbian public security .
djindjic , who took office in february 2001 after elections , also knew that he had his own laundry list of enemies lurking in the country : he was despised by some for his role in toppling milosevic and orchestrating his handover to the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands , in 2001 .
he outraged hardliners and nationalists by calling for more arrests of top serbian indicted war crimes suspects , such as the world 's no. 2 fugitive — former bosnian serb military commander gen. ratko mladic — who is believed to be hiding in serbia .
and he was hated by the powerful serbian crime bosses and warlords allied with milosevic after he recently declared an open war on organized crime , rampant corruption and smuggling .
organized crime blamed in attack a day after the sniper bullets pierced his chest and stomach , the serbian government left no doubt about whom it suspected was behind the attack .
it blamed an underworld network called the zemun gang , whose name comes from a belgrade suburb .
" the assassination of the serbian prime minister , zoran djindjic , represents an attempt to halt the government 's fight against organized crime and for members of the crime syndicate to avoid arrest , " a government statement said late wednesday .
a few sentences later , it added : " the assassination of the serbian prime minister represents an attempt by this group to create chaos , anarchy and fear ; all things that create a favorable environment for this group to operate . "
since the attack , authorities have arrested 40 people , belgrade police chief milan obradovic said on thursday . but acting prime minister zarko korac acknowledged in a radio interview that the main suspects remained at large .
the government statement listed 20 alleged zemun leaders , including milorad lukovic , a former head of the " red berets " - a special police unit that fought in the balkan wars .
also listed was dejan milenkovic , accused by police of trying to kill djindjic last month with a truck that swerved toward the prime minister 's convoy of cars .
police searching cars in the aftermath of the attack , the supreme defense council ordered the army of serbia and montenegro to " raise the readiness level , " a statement said .
police wearing flak jackets stopped and searched cars after the killing .
the government urged news organizations to stick to its line and threatened to suspend any that broke the rules .
the assassination left belgrade residents worried .

korean shares and the won have fallen sharply in recent days , as investors worried that more corporate malpractice could be uncovered after a $ 1.2bn accounting scandal at conglomerate sk group .
the sk affair came at a time when tensions with communist north korea have hit a peak .
fears of widespread defaults on corporate bonds were the immediate trigger for the central bank 's intervention , but seoul is also struggling to maintain the country 's credit rating .
rating agency moody 's has confirmed it is not cutting korea 's grade , but troubled markets by slapping a negative outlook on the country 's creditworthiness .
systemic risk investors are now waiting for the central bank 's next move , assuming that it can not simply keep pouring money into financial markets .
the bank has said it does not favour rate cuts as the main way of reigniting investor confidence , but may allow banks more flexibility in their market operations as a means of freeing more cash .
the bank has also been quick to play down the sk scandal , arguing that it did not represent any form of systemic risk .
the problems at sk were completely unlike those that brought down daewoo , once the country 's biggest industrial group , in 1999 .
nevertheless , ripples are beginning to spread .
government officials are scrutinising six conglomerates , spurred by the tougher anti-corruption policy of new president roh moo-hyun .

oil multinationals hope to win concessions in iraq " there is no doubt that we have seen a rise in the companies using our services .
they are revisiting contingency plans and looking for the best up-to-date advice . "
control risks , which serves 86 % of the companies in the ftse 100 , has been operating since 1975 , but has recently seen more competitors come onto the scene .
" security and risk analysis is much more on the boardroom agenda than it ever was , " added ms hudson .
as a result , the company has expanded its security division , which deals with contingency planning and the evacuation of staff .
war effort one sector more intimately identified with the build-up to war in iraq is the oil industry .
leaked reports suggest oil multinationals are already jostling to win concessions in any post-war reconstruction of iraq .
exxonmobil , unocal , bp and shell are all reportedly involved in informal negotiations with us officials and the iraqi exile community .
the spike in the oil price could also boost profits for oil companies , although some analysts argue that any gains are offset by a commensurate rise in costs .
there is no business upside to war bernard carey smiths group inevitably , war also brings spoils for defence companies .
" conflict invariably leads to increased demand , " said terry twigger , chief executive of meggitt , a uk company that supplies spare parts to military aircraft .
suppliers of military equipment usually perform better than the contractors , such as bae systems and france 's thales , because they have a more diversified client base , according to defence analyst harold hendrikse from credit suisse .
military spending some 36 % of meggitt 's turnover in 2002 came from supplying military equipment , including decoys used against radar-seeking missiles and model aeroplanes for target practice .
" over the last two years there has been a steady and sustained increase in military expenditure , " said mr twigger .
" whereas three or four years ago , spending had dropped when the world seemed a lot safer place . "
a surge in demand for military spares has also helped to buoy up profits at smiths group , another supplier .
however , both smiths and meggitt also have large divisions supplying the civil aerospace sector - and have seen sales drop in this area .
in the diversified and cyclical world of modern business , only true opportunists like the t-shirt seller can really cash in on conflict .
as mr carey points out : " there is no business upside to war .
" in the long-run we may benefit from increased -lsb- military -rsb- spending , but it will average out in time . "

they are revisiting contingency plans and looking for the best up-to-date advice . "
control risks , which serves 86 % of the companies in the ftse 100 , has been operating since 1975 , but has recently seen more competitors come onto the scene .
" security and risk analysis is much more on the boardroom agenda than it ever was , " added ms hudson .
as a result , the company has expanded its security division , which deals with contingency planning and the evacuation of staff .
war effort one sector more intimately identified with the build-up to war in iraq is the oil industry .
leaked reports suggest oil multinationals are already jostling to win concessions in any post-war reconstruction of iraq .
exxonmobil , unocal , bp and shell are all reportedly involved in informal negotiations with us officials and the iraqi exile community .
the spike in the oil price could also boost profits for oil companies , although some analysts argue that any gains are offset by a commensurate rise in costs .
there is no business upside to war bernard carey smiths group inevitably , war also brings spoils for defence companies .
" conflict invariably leads to increased demand , " said terry twigger , chief executive of meggitt , a uk company that supplies spare parts to military aircraft .
suppliers of military equipment usually perform better than the contractors , such as bae systems and france 's thales , because they have a more diversified client base , according to defence analyst harold hendrikse from credit suisse .
military spending some 36 % of meggitt 's turnover in 2002 came from supplying military equipment , including decoys used against radar-seeking missiles and model aeroplanes for target practice .
" over the last two years there has been a steady and sustained increase in military expenditure , " said mr twigger .
" whereas three or four years ago , spending had dropped when the world seemed a lot safer place . "
a surge in demand for military spares has also helped to buoy up profits at smiths group , another supplier .
however , both smiths and meggitt also have large divisions supplying the civil aerospace sector - and have seen sales drop in this area .
in the diversified and cyclical world of modern business , only true opportunists like the t-shirt seller can really cash in on conflict .
as mr carey points out : " there is no business upside to war .
" in the long-run we may benefit from increased -lsb- military -rsb- spending , but it will average out in time . "

federal prosecutors charged kevin howard and michael krautz - both with enron broadband services - with securities fraud , wire fraud , conspiracy and making false statements to fbi agents .
in a related filing , stock market regulator the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- charged the pair with violating a number of federal securities laws , including falsifying enron records and quarterly reports .
the alleged frauds were to support a transaction that the sec characterised as " a sham from its inception " .
separately , the commodity futures trading commission -lrb- cftc -rrb- charged enron with manipulating natural gas and agricultural commodity prices .
virtual video the charges relate to an attempt by enron - in partnership with video rental chain blockbuster - to set up an online video-on-demand service using broadband technology .
like many other enron ventures , this turned out to be largely fictitious .
according to court documents , although enron claimed $ 111m -lrb- £ 69m -rrb- in profits from the venture in 2000 and 2001 , no revenue was in fact generated .
according to the charges , enron secretly promised profits from the deal to outside investors .
these promises were hidden from shareholders and auditors , and the venture eventually evaporated in march 2001 when blockbuster pulled out .
dodgy futures the new charges coincided with long-expected action from the cftc , which regulates trading in the commodity markets that enron long dominated .
according to the cftc complaint , enron 's online subsidiary was used as " an illegal futures exchange " , and was the basis of several attempts to manipulate the natural gas market .
the firm also attempted to structure a timber deal that amounted to an illegal agricultural futures contract , the cftc alleged .
the charges are the latest in a tidal wave of litigation to hit the once-mighty firm since it admitted falsifying accounts in november 2001 .
so far , the us justice department has filed charges against 160 people , notably the company 's former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , who faces 78 separate indictments .
enron filed for bankruptcy in december 2001 , but still aims to emerge as a smaller but viable company at some point .

the authorities involved in administering the scheme have identified 28 learning providers with the highest risk of fraudulent activity , the auditor general 's report said .
the report concluded that the executive 's enterprise and lifelong learning department -lrb- elld -rrb- could have been more involved in the design and implementation of the scheme .

the auditor general for scotland said the scottish executive had failed to do enough to prevent fraud in the operation of individual learning accounts -lrb- ilas -rrb- .
robert black also raised a question mark over £ 4.5m of claims .
ilas entitled people to a grant of up to £ 200 towards educational courses to tackle skills shortages .
learning providers however , it soon emerged that the system which delivered them was open to abuse .
allegations surfaced in england that some registered training providers were manipulating the system to pocket the money while providing sub-standard courses or no courses at all .

but the scheme was shut down 18 months later amid fears of fraud .
the authorities involved in administering the scheme have identified 28 learning providers with the highest risk of fraudulent activity , the auditor general 's report said .
the report concluded that the executive 's enterprise and lifelong learning department -lrb- elld -rrb- could have been more involved in the design and implementation of the scheme .
