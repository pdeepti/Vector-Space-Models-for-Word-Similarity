you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree river in berlin runs past the museum island with the bode museum and the pergamonmuseum after flowing through wide stretches of farmland , the weser reaches bremen , a hanseatic port city -lrb- which was also the destination of choice for the four hopeful characters in the grimm story the bremen town musicians .
despite fierce competition from hamburg , bremen has been able to hold its own among german north sea ports , albeit on a smaller scale .
city river tours of course , if you don ’ t have several days to let the country float by you , a short day cruise might be more to your liking .
most of germany ’ s big cities are perched on the banks of a river : hamburg on the elbe , cologne on the rhine , munich on the isar , and berlin on the spree -lrb- photo of museum island -rrb- .
they all offer short jaunts up and down the waterways , past historical sites and beautiful landscapes .
and most can be booked for an hour or two , just long enough to allow you to sit back and rest your weary feet , take in a refreshing summer breeze , and enjoy seeing germany from a different perspective . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .
" the purpose of our letter was to get the industry to build out , as quickly as possible , a nationwide can return system that would allow people to return their empty cans to any store , " the eu environment minister told the paper . wallström said the industry 's interim system violated eu regulations , creating a competitive disadvantage for foreign distributors and customers and demanded a clarification from the german government on what steps were being taken to insure that the permanent can return system would be in place by october 1 . many of germany ’ s discount supermarkets have removed one-way bottles and cans from their shelves and some retailers have stopped charging the deposit altogether because of the hassle involved and the anger from customers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry loses fight against can deposit retailers and the drinks industry in germany have failed to stop new rules limiting single-use packaging for cans and bottles .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree river in berlin runs past the museum island with the bode museum and the pergamonmuseum after flowing through wide stretches of farmland , the weser reaches bremen , a hanseatic port city -lrb- which was also the destination of choice for the four hopeful characters in the grimm story the bremen town musicians .
despite fierce competition from hamburg , bremen has been able to hold its own among german north sea ports , albeit on a smaller scale .
city river tours of course , if you don ’ t have several days to let the country float by you , a short day cruise might be more to your liking .
most of germany ’ s big cities are perched on the banks of a river : hamburg on the elbe , cologne on the rhine , munich on the isar , and berlin on the spree -lrb- photo of museum island -rrb- .
they all offer short jaunts up and down the waterways , past historical sites and beautiful landscapes .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .
" the purpose of our letter was to get the industry to build out , as quickly as possible , a nationwide can return system that would allow people to return their empty cans to any store , " the eu environment minister told the paper . wallström said the industry 's interim system violated eu regulations , creating a competitive disadvantage for foreign distributors and customers and demanded a clarification from the german government on what steps were being taken to insure that the permanent can return system would be in place by october 1 . many of germany ’ s discount supermarkets have removed one-way bottles and cans from their shelves and some retailers have stopped charging the deposit altogether because of the hassle involved and the anger from customers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry loses fight against can deposit retailers and the drinks industry in germany have failed to stop new rules limiting single-use packaging for cans and bottles .

“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .
" the purpose of our letter was to get the industry to build out , as quickly as possible , a nationwide can return system that would allow people to return their empty cans to any store , " the eu environment minister told the paper . wallström said the industry 's interim system violated eu regulations , creating a competitive disadvantage for foreign distributors and customers and demanded a clarification from the german government on what steps were being taken to insure that the permanent can return system would be in place by october 1 . many of germany ’ s discount supermarkets have removed one-way bottles and cans from their shelves and some retailers have stopped charging the deposit altogether because of the hassle involved and the anger from customers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry loses fight against can deposit retailers and the drinks industry in germany have failed to stop new rules limiting single-use packaging for cans and bottles .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree river in berlin runs past the museum island with the bode museum and the pergamonmuseum after flowing through wide stretches of farmland , the weser reaches bremen , a hanseatic port city -lrb- which was also the destination of choice for the four hopeful characters in the grimm story the bremen town musicians .
despite fierce competition from hamburg , bremen has been able to hold its own among german north sea ports , albeit on a smaller scale .
city river tours of course , if you don ’ t have several days to let the country float by you , a short day cruise might be more to your liking .
most of germany ’ s big cities are perched on the banks of a river : hamburg on the elbe , cologne on the rhine , munich on the isar , and berlin on the spree -lrb- photo of museum island -rrb- .
they all offer short jaunts up and down the waterways , past historical sites and beautiful landscapes .
and most can be booked for an hour or two , just long enough to allow you to sit back and rest your weary feet , take in a refreshing summer breeze , and enjoy seeing germany from a different perspective . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree river in berlin runs past the museum island with the bode museum and the pergamonmuseum after flowing through wide stretches of farmland , the weser reaches bremen , a hanseatic port city -lrb- which was also the destination of choice for the four hopeful characters in the grimm story the bremen town musicians .
despite fierce competition from hamburg , bremen has been able to hold its own among german north sea ports , albeit on a smaller scale .
city river tours of course , if you don ’ t have several days to let the country float by you , a short day cruise might be more to your liking .
most of germany ’ s big cities are perched on the banks of a river : hamburg on the elbe , cologne on the rhine , munich on the isar , and berlin on the spree -lrb- photo of museum island -rrb- .
they all offer short jaunts up and down the waterways , past historical sites and beautiful landscapes .
and most can be booked for an hour or two , just long enough to allow you to sit back and rest your weary feet , take in a refreshing summer breeze , and enjoy seeing germany from a different perspective . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.06.2003 blair grilled over handling of iraq weapons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is under fire for allegedly misleading parliament in order to justify british involvement in a war on iraq .
british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .

despite fierce competition from hamburg , bremen has been able to hold its own among german north sea ports , albeit on a smaller scale .
city river tours of course , if you don ’ t have several days to let the country float by you , a short day cruise might be more to your liking .
most of germany ’ s big cities are perched on the banks of a river : hamburg on the elbe , cologne on the rhine , munich on the isar , and berlin on the spree -lrb- photo of museum island -rrb- .
they all offer short jaunts up and down the waterways , past historical sites and beautiful landscapes .
and most can be booked for an hour or two , just long enough to allow you to sit back and rest your weary feet , take in a refreshing summer breeze , and enjoy seeing germany from a different perspective . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree river in berlin runs past the museum island with the bode museum and the pergamonmuseum after flowing through wide stretches of farmland , the weser reaches bremen , a hanseatic port city -lrb- which was also the destination of choice for the four hopeful characters in the grimm story the bremen town musicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.06.2003 blair grilled over handling of iraq weapons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is under fire for allegedly misleading parliament in order to justify british involvement in a war on iraq .
british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .
" the purpose of our letter was to get the industry to build out , as quickly as possible , a nationwide can return system that would allow people to return their empty cans to any store , " the eu environment minister told the paper . wallström said the industry 's interim system violated eu regulations , creating a competitive disadvantage for foreign distributors and customers and demanded a clarification from the german government on what steps were being taken to insure that the permanent can return system would be in place by october 1 . many of germany ’ s discount supermarkets have removed one-way bottles and cans from their shelves and some retailers have stopped charging the deposit altogether because of the hassle involved and the anger from customers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry loses fight against can deposit retailers and the drinks industry in germany have failed to stop new rules limiting single-use packaging for cans and bottles .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .

despite fierce competition from hamburg , bremen has been able to hold its own among german north sea ports , albeit on a smaller scale .
city river tours of course , if you don ’ t have several days to let the country float by you , a short day cruise might be more to your liking .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .
" the purpose of our letter was to get the industry to build out , as quickly as possible , a nationwide can return system that would allow people to return their empty cans to any store , " the eu environment minister told the paper . wallström said the industry 's interim system violated eu regulations , creating a competitive disadvantage for foreign distributors and customers and demanded a clarification from the german government on what steps were being taken to insure that the permanent can return system would be in place by october 1 . many of germany ’ s discount supermarkets have removed one-way bottles and cans from their shelves and some retailers have stopped charging the deposit altogether because of the hassle involved and the anger from customers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry loses fight against can deposit retailers and the drinks industry in germany have failed to stop new rules limiting single-use packaging for cans and bottles .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .

you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .
" the purpose of our letter was to get the industry to build out , as quickly as possible , a nationwide can return system that would allow people to return their empty cans to any store , " the eu environment minister told the paper . wallström said the industry 's interim system violated eu regulations , creating a competitive disadvantage for foreign distributors and customers and demanded a clarification from the german government on what steps were being taken to insure that the permanent can return system would be in place by october 1 . many of germany ’ s discount supermarkets have removed one-way bottles and cans from their shelves and some retailers have stopped charging the deposit altogether because of the hassle involved and the anger from customers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry loses fight against can deposit retailers and the drinks industry in germany have failed to stop new rules limiting single-use packaging for cans and bottles .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .

you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree river in berlin runs past the museum island with the bode museum and the pergamonmuseum after flowing through wide stretches of farmland , the weser reaches bremen , a hanseatic port city -lrb- which was also the destination of choice for the four hopeful characters in the grimm story the bremen town musicians .
despite fierce competition from hamburg , bremen has been able to hold its own among german north sea ports , albeit on a smaller scale .
city river tours of course , if you don ’ t have several days to let the country float by you , a short day cruise might be more to your liking .
most of germany ’ s big cities are perched on the banks of a river : hamburg on the elbe , cologne on the rhine , munich on the isar , and berlin on the spree -lrb- photo of museum island -rrb- .
they all offer short jaunts up and down the waterways , past historical sites and beautiful landscapes .
and most can be booked for an hour or two , just long enough to allow you to sit back and rest your weary feet , take in a refreshing summer breeze , and enjoy seeing germany from a different perspective . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spree river in berlin runs past the museum island with the bode museum and the pergamonmuseum after flowing through wide stretches of farmland , the weser reaches bremen , a hanseatic port city -lrb- which was also the destination of choice for the four hopeful characters in the grimm story the bremen town musicians .
despite fierce competition from hamburg , bremen has been able to hold its own among german north sea ports , albeit on a smaller scale .
city river tours of course , if you don ’ t have several days to let the country float by you , a short day cruise might be more to your liking .
most of germany ’ s big cities are perched on the banks of a river : hamburg on the elbe , cologne on the rhine , munich on the isar , and berlin on the spree -lrb- photo of museum island -rrb- .
they all offer short jaunts up and down the waterways , past historical sites and beautiful landscapes .
and most can be booked for an hour or two , just long enough to allow you to sit back and rest your weary feet , take in a refreshing summer breeze , and enjoy seeing germany from a different perspective . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .
travelers can check in with childhood friends such as cinderella -lrb- in polle -rrb- , hansel and gretel -lrb- in höxter -rrb- , and the pied piper of hamelin -lrb- hameln -rrb- .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .
" the purpose of our letter was to get the industry to build out , as quickly as possible , a nationwide can return system that would allow people to return their empty cans to any store , " the eu environment minister told the paper . wallström said the industry 's interim system violated eu regulations , creating a competitive disadvantage for foreign distributors and customers and demanded a clarification from the german government on what steps were being taken to insure that the permanent can return system would be in place by october 1 . many of germany ’ s discount supermarkets have removed one-way bottles and cans from their shelves and some retailers have stopped charging the deposit altogether because of the hassle involved and the anger from customers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry loses fight against can deposit retailers and the drinks industry in germany have failed to stop new rules limiting single-use packaging for cans and bottles .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush . " if weapons of mass destruction are not found - and that is still a big ' if ' - and there is a feeling his government misled the people , then tony blair is in big trouble , " vernon bogdanor , an oxford university political scientist , told reuters . compiled by dw-world staff from wire services send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

british prime minister tony blair , under fire for allegedly hyping up evidence of iraq 's weapons of mass destruction , announced a parliamentary inquiry to probe the justification for the iraq war . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday a parliamentary committee will investigate claims british intelligence services " sexed up " a government dossier on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
but he denied downing street misled parliament in order to justify the need to go to war with iraq . blair faced tough questions from opposition and government politicians alike in a particularly turbulent parliamentary session . " if we can be deceived about this , then what can we not be deceived about ? " former government minister claire short , who resigned over the handling of postwar iraq , told parliament . demand for independant probe leader of the opposition conservatives iain duncan smith said , " nobody believes a word now that the prime minister is saying . " smith also called for an independent inquiry and said the government 's credibility was now at stake over the affair . but blair rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , saying he welcomed the probe by the cross-party intelligence and security committee . he added the government would " fully cooperate with it . " however , the investigation came under fire from both labor and opposition party parliamentarians .
they say the committee - which meets behind closed doors and is headed by a former member of blair 's government - will not provide sufficient answers . " i remind the whole house that the prime minister will only let that committee see the intelligence reports he wants them to see , " duncan smith said . blair has been under mounting pressure to answer questions about why coalition forces have not yet found any evidence that iraq had stockpiled chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
the alleged existence of the weapons was blair 's principal reason for going to war . during heated exchanges in parliament , blair stuck to his stance and insisted that going to war to unseat saddam hussein had been the right thing .
" the truth is , some people resent the fact it was right to go to conflict .
we won the conflict thanks to the magnificent contribution of the british troops , and iraq is now free and we should be proud of that , " the british premier said . media report led to row the wrangling over the existence of weapons of mass destruction ; came to a head last week after the bbc cited an anonymous intelligence source saying blair 's office coerced intelligence services to include a claim that iraq 's weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes .
blair blasted the report as " completely and utterly untrue " and insisted that his office had n't doctored the dossier to emphasize the 45-minute claim . the debate over the report heated up on wednesday , when leader of the house of commons john reid accused " rogue elements " in the security services of seeking to undermine the government .
his remarks kicked off further questions from legislators about the reliability of intelligence agencies and the need for a thorough inquiry . " when you have somebody making the kinds of remarks that john reid has made , on the record and widely retailed in the media today , i think both parliamentary opinion and public opinion , in terms of the political process as a whole , will not be satisfied unless we have a wholly independent inquiry , " liberal democrat leader charles kennedy told bbc radio scotland .
the public , he said , " can not now trust the security services . " no smoking gun ? tony blair , who risked his own premiership over going to war against iraq , has long maintained that iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction .
in april , he told the house of commons that saddam was " a threat to his own people and to the region and , if allowed to develop these weapons , a threat to us also . "
he continued : " doing nothing is not an option ...
our way of proceeding should be and will be measured , calm and thought through . "
but despite the growing pressure on blair and u.s. president george w. bush to provide evidence of the " smoking gun , " u.n. weapons inspectors - who are now back at work in iraq after the hussein regime fell in april - have yet to find any evidence .
british tabloid the daily mirror reported wednesday that 87 suspected wmd sites have been given the all-clear .
under the headline " zilch , " the daily mirror said the sites - 19 of which were categorized by u.s. central command as " highest priority " - had revealed no chemical or biological weapons , rather " a training facility for iraq 's olympic swimming and diving teams , a drinks distillery and a factory making car license plates . " washington still maintains iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
wednesday 's furor in the british parliament coincided with u.s. senate committee hearings in washington over its government 's justifications for war . political analysts believe growing doubt over london and washington 's grounds for waging war against iraq spell more political risks for the british prime minister than for u.s. president bush .

you may want to consider a river cruise .
just sit back , relax , and watch thousands of years of history glide by . it ’ s a typical case of the traveler ’ s blues : your feet hurt from tramping around too many medieval churches .
a bus tour ?
too claustrophobic .
and cycling would be too much like hard work .
lucky for you there 's another way to visit germany : floating along on its waterways .
germany has more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of interconnected rivers , canals and lakes whose waters are plied by barges and sailboats , cruise ships and kayaks .
the quaint tourist centers people visit today grew up along those routes centuries ago , but the rhine and elbe rivers are still busy transport waterways , crucial to german industry and agriculture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rhein mit loreley in st. goarshausen one of the great pleasures of the cruise experience is sitting back and taking it all in – sipping a riesling or pilsner while watching the scenery go by .
but a river cruise doesn ’ t need to be an entirely passive experience .
there are plenty of chances to stop and visit the castles , palaces and vineyards dotting the banks of the main tourist rivers : the rhine , weser , danube , and mosel .
river of painters and poets hands down , germany 's most famous river is the rhine .
although it has inspired painters and poets for centuries , the romantics of the mid-19th century drew particular inspiration from its dramatic beauty .
they made the legend of the lorelei – based on a towering cliff along the rhine – into one of their key symbols .
according to the myth , a maiden named lorelei sat upon a cliff at the river ’ s narrowest , deepest and swiftest point .
she combed her golden hair and bewitched the hearts of sailors with her singing .
when they looked up at the irresistible siren , their boats would crash and sink .
should your modern-day cruise ship manage to get past the lorelei unscathed -lrb- chances are better these days , since the once-dangerous passage is now clearly marked with buoys -rrb- it 's worth taking some time to explore the sides of the valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at frankfurt an der oder , visitors can cross the oder river to the polish town of slubice long stretches of the rhine ’ s banks are covered with terraced vineyards , and picturesque castles perch on hilltops .
the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .
the romans left their mark there , and a trip down the river can take you from germany ’ s best preserved medieval city , regensburg , to passau , which lies at the confluence of the danube , inn and ilz rivers .
from there you slip downstream beyond the german border to vienna and budapest , past the castles , palaces and vineyards of central europe .
nature and culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden on the elbe river is one of germany 's architectural gems the river oder is germany 's easternmost river , and to travel along it is to tread the line between germany and poland .
the oder valley ’ s isolation under the gdr left it nearly undisturbed by human activity , and today it is known for its marshes and lakes dotted with untouched villages that are unlike anything in western germany .
you pass through wildlife-rich natural parks like the lower oder valley national park and the oderbruch marshlands .
of course , the polish border region is also a must for world war ii buffs – the place where the russians broke through the german lines to start the final assault on berlin .
if you 're feeling really ambitious , and you have a lot of time , you can take a cruise on the elbe from magdeburg to prague , the capital of the czech republic .
the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .
from its birthplace in the czech republic to the point where it sinks into the north sea , in hamburg , the elbe is over 1,000 kilometers long .
the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .
located on the banks of the elbe are towns like dessau , home to the famous bauhaus school of architects ; luther 's former home wittenberg , and meißen , famous for its porcelain .
the baroque city of dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- , capital of saxony , also lies on the banks of the elbe .
meeting up with the brothers grimm fans of german fairy tales will get a lot out of cruising the weser , the birthplace of the brothers grimm and inspiration for some of their best-known stories .
germany ’ s ‘ fairy tale road , ’ with its half-timbered towns and castles , follows the course of the river .

the valley ’ s footpaths and trails offer magnificent views , including well-marked ‘ tourist roads ’ such as the winding lorelei castle road and the rhine wine trail .
the area is a wine lover ’ s dream , with endless opportunities to tour wineries , attend tastings , and take courses on the wines and foods of the regions .
a busy tourist area , the rhine valley has some of the best-appointed hotels in the country – and fine restaurants to go with them .
gateway to history if you are as interested in history as you are in wine , you might prefer a trip down the danube .
the danube -lrb- which , just to make things clear , isn ’ t blue -rrb- is europe ’ s second-longest river .
it does n't have the dramatic scenery or castles of the rhine , but it 's worth exploring for its own quiet charm and the traces of its varied , exotic history .

the elbe is the most important river linking southeastern europe with northeastern europe .

the elbe passes through varied and distinct landscapes , starting with a sandstone massif and running through vineyards to end up in meadow lowlands .

in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers . since it came into effect at the beginning of the year , retailers and the beverage industry have been loath to go along with new german legislation that requires consumers to pay a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles . while the government hopes to increase recycling , the business community has complained the scheme is inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the industry is now balking at setting up an expensive network of deposit machines by october 1 , saying on tuesday there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the billions of euros investment . “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs , ” said peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , in a statement .
“ we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” although the industry has made no secret it would like to kill the can deposit altogether , the latest row was sparked by a letter to german environment minister jürgen trittin by european commission officials who are concerned the present awkward system unfairly penalizes non-german beverage companies . present system a mess the current system has proven highly unpopular with both retailers and consumers alike , because in order to get back the hefty deposit on a can of beer or bottle of soda , you have to take the container back to the place of purchase . trittin and other officials say the industry has only itself to blame , since it had nine months before the law went into effect to build a nationwide network of recycling machines .
on wednesday , trittin dismissed the industry ’ s stand as “ ridiculous ” and only an “ excuse ” to torpedo the deposit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission , ” trittin told the german news agency dpa . trittin said the letter from eu internal market and environment commissioners , frits bolkestein and margot wallström , only criticized that the recycling network was not yet in operation and questioned if it could not be introduced sooner . in an interview with the financial times deutschland newspaper published on thursday , wallström backed up trittin 's description of the missive .
" the purpose of our letter was to get the industry to build out , as quickly as possible , a nationwide can return system that would allow people to return their empty cans to any store , " the eu environment minister told the paper . wallström said the industry 's interim system violated eu regulations , creating a competitive disadvantage for foreign distributors and customers and demanded a clarification from the german government on what steps were being taken to insure that the permanent can return system would be in place by october 1 . many of germany ’ s discount supermarkets have removed one-way bottles and cans from their shelves and some retailers have stopped charging the deposit altogether because of the hassle involved and the anger from customers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry loses fight against can deposit retailers and the drinks industry in germany have failed to stop new rules limiting single-use packaging for cans and bottles .

" i want you to know that i am innocent - and that i will fight to clear my name , " she wrote in a letter published in usa today and online at marthatalks.com.
on wednesday ms stewart was charged with securities fraud and obstruction of justice in relation to trading in shares of biotech firm imclone .
she later resigned as head of her company , martha stewart living omnimedia , which trades on her reputation as a tasteful homemaker .
" i am confident i will be exonerated of these baseless charges , " ms stewart wrote .
' i simply returned a call ' in her brief letter , ms stewart attempted to shield her company from the effects of any legal action , pointing out that the charges were a purely personal matter .
ms stewart sold imclone shares the day before regulators rejected the company 's application to market the cancer drug erbitux .
the accusation is that she was acting on a tip-off from her friend , imclone founder sam waksal , who has already admitted charges of securities fraud .
" i simply returned a call from my stockbroker , " ms stewart wrote .
" i later denied any wrongdoing in public statements and in voluntary interviews with prosecutors .
the government 's attempt to criminalise these actions makes no sense to me .
" i am confident i will be exonerated of these baseless charges . "
dealing difficulties ms stewart 's case is still at an uncertain stage .
the charges levelled so far revolve around her alleged attempts to conceal wrongdoing , rather than insider dealing , an offence extremely difficult to prosecute successfully .
she is , however , being sued by the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , the us stock market regulator , for insider trading .
the burden of proof in civil cases is lower than in a criminal trial .

a poll for the liberal democrats found that 67 % of those asked said their decisions on whether to go to university would be influenced by an increase in tuition fees .
and 69 % of students from poorer families who planned to go to university said an increase might stop them .
the government plans to allow universities to raise tuition fees up to a ceiling of £ 3,000 a year from september 2006 .
at the moment students in england pay £ 1,100 a year , although about a third of dependent students pay nothing because the fees are means-tested .
nearly 2,500 16 year olds were questioned for the poll .
their year will be the first to pay top-up fees .
two-thirds of them said their choice of university would also be affected by tuition fees , since universities will be allowed to charge different fees .
cheaper universities the liberal democrats ' education spokesman phil willis said the poll was damning evidence that labour 's policy would hit students from poorer backgrounds hardest .
" investing in our young people means investing in britain 's future , " said mr willis .
" the right to a good education should be based on ability , not ability to pay .
" if today 's 16 year olds have been put off going to university by current government proposals , their present commitment to education will have been damaged .
university funding the government has set a target of getting " towards 50 % " of people under the age of 30 into higher education by 2010 under its plans , annual tuition fees , currently set at £ 1,100 , would rise to a maximum of £ 3,000 from 2006 but families earning less than £ 30,000 would still get help with the first £ 1,100 of fees from 2004 , students with family incomes of less than £ 20,000 will get an annual grant , calculated on a sliding scale those whose families earn under £ 10,000 will receive £ 1,000 a year " british students should not have to choose their university by how much they charge .
" poorer students will naturally choose cheaper universities , while only rich pupils will be able to afford the more expensive . "
of those questioned , 40 % said they thought they would qualify for assistance in paying the tuition fees .
as part of its reforms for higher education , the government is re-introducing the maintenance grant for some students .
from next year , those with family incomes of less than £ 10,000 will get a grant of £ 1,000 a year as well as their full existing student loan entitlement .
a reducing amount will be paid to those on family incomes of up to £ 20,000 .
when top-up fees are introduced in 2006 , the first £ 1,100 will continue to be means-tested , with poorer students ' fees being paid for them on a sliding scale up to a family income of £ 30,000 .
the government says about 40 % will pay the full amount .
the liberal democrats conducted their own survey this spring .
they say they contacted 311 schools in england , chosen on gcse results , to reflect a wide range .
teachers were asked to photo-copy the survey and distribute them to children .
national union of students president mandy telford said : " to have a truly world class higher education system we need all students to be able to fulfil their potential .
" we can not do that if some are forced to choose cheaper courses and others opt not to go at all because of the debt and hardship they will face .

their year will be the first to pay top-up fees .
two-thirds of them said their choice of university would also be affected by tuition fees , since universities will be allowed to charge different fees .
cheaper universities the liberal democrats ' education spokesman phil willis said the poll was damning evidence that labour 's policy would hit students from poorer backgrounds hardest .
" investing in our young people means investing in britain 's future , " said mr willis .

a reducing amount will be paid to those on family incomes of up to £ 20,000 .
when top-up fees are introduced in 2006 , the first £ 1,100 will continue to be means-tested , with poorer students ' fees being paid for them on a sliding scale up to a family income of £ 30,000 .

teachers were asked to photo-copy the survey and distribute them to children .
national union of students president mandy telford said : " to have a truly world class higher education system we need all students to be able to fulfil their potential .

university funding the government has set a target of getting " towards 50 % " of people under the age of 30 into higher education by 2010 under its plans , annual tuition fees , currently set at £ 1,100 , would rise to a maximum of £ 3,000 from 2006 but families earning less than £ 30,000 would still get help with the first £ 1,100 of fees from 2004 , students with family incomes of less than £ 20,000 will get an annual grant , calculated on a sliding scale those whose families earn under £ 10,000 will receive £ 1,000 a year " british students should not have to choose their university by how much they charge .
" poorer students will naturally choose cheaper universities , while only rich pupils will be able to afford the more expensive . "
of those questioned , 40 % said they thought they would qualify for assistance in paying the tuition fees .
as part of its reforms for higher education , the government is re-introducing the maintenance grant for some students .
from next year , those with family incomes of less than £ 10,000 will get a grant of £ 1,000 a year as well as their full existing student loan entitlement .
a reducing amount will be paid to those on family incomes of up to £ 20,000 .
when top-up fees are introduced in 2006 , the first £ 1,100 will continue to be means-tested , with poorer students ' fees being paid for them on a sliding scale up to a family income of £ 30,000 .
the government says about 40 % will pay the full amount .
the liberal democrats conducted their own survey this spring .
they say they contacted 311 schools in england , chosen on gcse results , to reflect a wide range .
teachers were asked to photo-copy the survey and distribute them to children .
national union of students president mandy telford said : " to have a truly world class higher education system we need all students to be able to fulfil their potential .
" we can not do that if some are forced to choose cheaper courses and others opt not to go at all because of the debt and hardship they will face .
" if the government continues with its policy of top-up fees , we will have a higher education system where only the rich will benefit . "

bbc news online asks if these landmark projects have a value to match their cost .
david mcneill from the arts council of england says : " i think people should know that for every opera house there are a hundred brass bands we 've helped . "
it gets to the heart of a problem which , eight years into its existence , the lottery distributors are trying to address : the big projects get all the publicity while the thousands of small scale community schemes go unnoticed .
last year a public consultation on lottery funding concluded : " there is -lrb- public -rrb- agreement that the -lrb- millennium -rrb- dome was a waste of good causes funds and that this project in itself has tarnished the supply of funds to large capital projects . "
it is not alone , as david mcneill acknowledges , pointing to two projects jointly funded to the tune of £ 18m : " one of the harder lessons we 've learned is there is no point putting up a brand new building in a part of the world where no one wants to go to it .
" the ark in stockton-on-tees did n't work because people did n't want to go there .
it was a similar story with the museum of popular music which was built in the wrong part of sheffield . "
' pride in the lottery ' but these are just three of a near 100,000 awards given , ranging in value from £ 500 to the £ 628m ploughed into the dome .
richard caborn , a minister at the department for culture , media and sport -lrb- dcms -rrb- , told bbc news online : " it 's true that early on the lottery tended mainly to fund big capital projects .
the lottery has funded some of the biggest capital projects in britain " the number of smaller grants going to community groups has more than trebled since the 1998 -lrb- government -rrb- reforms .
that means that many more projects are being funded than previously .
" we should take pride in some of the big schemes that the lottery has helped fund , but we should be equally proud of all the other more local projects which have been funded by the lottery which can make a real difference to us on a daily basis but which do n't necessarily hit the headlines .
" it is one of the lottery 's great strengths that it can and does fund so many different kinds of projects .
some , like tim jones from birmingham city council , argue the big projects are necessary to help spread awareness of lottery funding .
wider benefits mr jones , project manager of the £ 31m -lrb- £ 13.5m from lottery funds -rrb- project to renovate birmingham 's town hall , said : " these high profile schemes have a major impact way beyond the projects themselves .
" because of the profile of the town hall , i 've been approached by several organisations asking how they would go about securing funding . "
the refurbishment of birmingham town hall is attracting other bids for different reasons , laura willoughby , a councillor from islington , agrees with mr jones : " these projects contribute to the cultural industry in the area and provide projects for the community .
" the sadler 's wells theatre project -lrb- £ 73m in lottery funding -rrb- created spaces which are used by the community and especially by schools .
" there 's no evidence that funding major schemes prevents funding for other smaller projects in islington .
we do n't seem to be competing with sadler 's wells and projects like it .
" these are nationally prestigious projects which we have in our borough .
their existence improves the amount of spending in the area and brings people into the borough .
this in turn helps sustain services and the economy around the theatre . "
the lottery losers similarly , the commonwealth games -lrb- £ 123.5m from the lottery -rrb- helped regenerate east manchester while improvements in the digbeth area of birmingham were prompted by the £ 50m millennium point attraction .
the problem remains , though , that the public prefer community based projects to the giant landmark schemes .
this was a further finding of last year 's consultation .
while the major cities can point to at least one big money project , places like hart in hampshire may find it more difficult to feel part of the lottery money-go-round .
hart has received less grants per head of population than any other local authority area in the uk .
the 60 awards in the borough range from £ 312,829 for the local cricket club to £ 500 for the holy ridiculous entertainment group .
more worthy than the dome ?
well , if they do not get publicised , who would know ?
next : london bias .
does the capital receive the lion 's share of lottery funds ?
