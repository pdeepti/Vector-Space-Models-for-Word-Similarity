germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
schröder and sommer cancelled a meeting on tuesday after talks between the government and unions on the reforms made no headway . unions seen as opposed to reform germany ’ s unions have come up with their own proposals to help counter the public perception that they are simply blocking desperately needed reforms .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .
“ their effect would be extremely questionable . ” budget deficit problem in particular , the dgb proposal to increase federal borrowing by € 7.5 billion is likely a non-starter for the government .
germany is required by european union rules to keep its budget deficit under three percent of its gross domestic product or face sanctions .
taking on the debt that the unions propose would likely present more trouble with brussels than berlin would be willing to risk . “ i think there were a lot of proposals that at the end of the day simply could never be financed , ” thomas straubhaar , the president of the hamburg-based hwwa economic institute , told ndr radio . schröder stuck to his reform course at a regional spd congress in hamburg on wednesday evening .
the government has organized four regional meetings to make its case for the reforms ahead of a special national spd congress on june 1 . “ if we don ’ t shape this process , than it will be shaped without us and people will be worse off , ” said schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.05.2003 berlin studio plays host to hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackie chan busts a move on the streets of central berlin .
hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .
above the constant calls of " jackie !
jackie !
jackie ! , " many were thrilled by the filming going on in berlin .
" it 's like a big party , " one onlooker said .

" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .

" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .
above the constant calls of " jackie !

germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .

in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.05.2003 berlin studio plays host to hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackie chan busts a move on the streets of central berlin .
hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .
above the constant calls of " jackie !
jackie !
jackie ! , " many were thrilled by the filming going on in berlin .
" it 's like a big party , " one onlooker said .
" it 's wonderful . " ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
schröder and sommer cancelled a meeting on tuesday after talks between the government and unions on the reforms made no headway . unions seen as opposed to reform germany ’ s unions have come up with their own proposals to help counter the public perception that they are simply blocking desperately needed reforms .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .

germany is required by european union rules to keep its budget deficit under three percent of its gross domestic product or face sanctions .
taking on the debt that the unions propose would likely present more trouble with brussels than berlin would be willing to risk . “ i think there were a lot of proposals that at the end of the day simply could never be financed , ” thomas straubhaar , the president of the hamburg-based hwwa economic institute , told ndr radio . schröder stuck to his reform course at a regional spd congress in hamburg on wednesday evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.05.2003 berlin studio plays host to hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackie chan busts a move on the streets of central berlin .
hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .
above the constant calls of " jackie !
jackie !
jackie ! , " many were thrilled by the filming going on in berlin .
" it 's like a big party , " one onlooker said .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .

germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
schröder and sommer cancelled a meeting on tuesday after talks between the government and unions on the reforms made no headway . unions seen as opposed to reform germany ’ s unions have come up with their own proposals to help counter the public perception that they are simply blocking desperately needed reforms .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .
“ their effect would be extremely questionable . ” budget deficit problem in particular , the dgb proposal to increase federal borrowing by € 7.5 billion is likely a non-starter for the government .
germany is required by european union rules to keep its budget deficit under three percent of its gross domestic product or face sanctions .
taking on the debt that the unions propose would likely present more trouble with brussels than berlin would be willing to risk . “ i think there were a lot of proposals that at the end of the day simply could never be financed , ” thomas straubhaar , the president of the hamburg-based hwwa economic institute , told ndr radio . schröder stuck to his reform course at a regional spd congress in hamburg on wednesday evening .
the government has organized four regional meetings to make its case for the reforms ahead of a special national spd congress on june 1 . “ if we don ’ t shape this process , than it will be shaped without us and people will be worse off , ” said schröder .

germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
schröder and sommer cancelled a meeting on tuesday after talks between the government and unions on the reforms made no headway . unions seen as opposed to reform germany ’ s unions have come up with their own proposals to help counter the public perception that they are simply blocking desperately needed reforms .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .
“ their effect would be extremely questionable . ” budget deficit problem in particular , the dgb proposal to increase federal borrowing by € 7.5 billion is likely a non-starter for the government .
germany is required by european union rules to keep its budget deficit under three percent of its gross domestic product or face sanctions .
taking on the debt that the unions propose would likely present more trouble with brussels than berlin would be willing to risk . “ i think there were a lot of proposals that at the end of the day simply could never be financed , ” thomas straubhaar , the president of the hamburg-based hwwa economic institute , told ndr radio . schröder stuck to his reform course at a regional spd congress in hamburg on wednesday evening .
the government has organized four regional meetings to make its case for the reforms ahead of a special national spd congress on june 1 . “ if we don ’ t shape this process , than it will be shaped without us and people will be worse off , ” said schröder .
“ we have to marshal the necessary strength for it . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets earful at may day reform showdown thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .

last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .

germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
schröder and sommer cancelled a meeting on tuesday after talks between the government and unions on the reforms made no headway . unions seen as opposed to reform germany ’ s unions have come up with their own proposals to help counter the public perception that they are simply blocking desperately needed reforms .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .
“ their effect would be extremely questionable . ” budget deficit problem in particular , the dgb proposal to increase federal borrowing by € 7.5 billion is likely a non-starter for the government .
germany is required by european union rules to keep its budget deficit under three percent of its gross domestic product or face sanctions .
taking on the debt that the unions propose would likely present more trouble with brussels than berlin would be willing to risk . “ i think there were a lot of proposals that at the end of the day simply could never be financed , ” thomas straubhaar , the president of the hamburg-based hwwa economic institute , told ndr radio . schröder stuck to his reform course at a regional spd congress in hamburg on wednesday evening .
the government has organized four regional meetings to make its case for the reforms ahead of a special national spd congress on june 1 . “ if we don ’ t shape this process , than it will be shaped without us and people will be worse off , ” said schröder .

economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .
“ their effect would be extremely questionable . ” budget deficit problem in particular , the dgb proposal to increase federal borrowing by € 7.5 billion is likely a non-starter for the government .
germany is required by european union rules to keep its budget deficit under three percent of its gross domestic product or face sanctions .
taking on the debt that the unions propose would likely present more trouble with brussels than berlin would be willing to risk . “ i think there were a lot of proposals that at the end of the day simply could never be financed , ” thomas straubhaar , the president of the hamburg-based hwwa economic institute , told ndr radio . schröder stuck to his reform course at a regional spd congress in hamburg on wednesday evening .
the government has organized four regional meetings to make its case for the reforms ahead of a special national spd congress on june 1 . “ if we don ’ t shape this process , than it will be shaped without us and people will be worse off , ” said schröder .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .
above the constant calls of " jackie !
jackie !
jackie ! , " many were thrilled by the filming going on in berlin .
" it 's like a big party , " one onlooker said .
" it 's wonderful . " ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .

dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
schröder and sommer cancelled a meeting on tuesday after talks between the government and unions on the reforms made no headway . unions seen as opposed to reform germany ’ s unions have come up with their own proposals to help counter the public perception that they are simply blocking desperately needed reforms .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .
“ their effect would be extremely questionable . ” budget deficit problem in particular , the dgb proposal to increase federal borrowing by € 7.5 billion is likely a non-starter for the government .
germany is required by european union rules to keep its budget deficit under three percent of its gross domestic product or face sanctions .
taking on the debt that the unions propose would likely present more trouble with brussels than berlin would be willing to risk . “ i think there were a lot of proposals that at the end of the day simply could never be financed , ” thomas straubhaar , the president of the hamburg-based hwwa economic institute , told ndr radio . schröder stuck to his reform course at a regional spd congress in hamburg on wednesday evening .
the government has organized four regional meetings to make its case for the reforms ahead of a special national spd congress on june 1 . “ if we don ’ t shape this process , than it will be shaped without us and people will be worse off , ” said schröder .
“ we have to marshal the necessary strength for it . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets earful at may day reform showdown thousands of germans took to the streets thursday , joining traditional may day marches .
trade unions are hoping to use the nationwide demonstrations to mobilize support against the government ’ s planned welfare reforms .
-lrb- may 1 , 2003 -rrb- unions threaten to oppose german reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder failed this week to persuade the nation ’ s trade unions to support his plans to reform the welfare state , heralding what could be a major confrontation with organized labor this spring .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .

germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .
schröder and sommer cancelled a meeting on tuesday after talks between the government and unions on the reforms made no headway . unions seen as opposed to reform germany ’ s unions have come up with their own proposals to help counter the public perception that they are simply blocking desperately needed reforms .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at almost 11 percent . the dgb said its plan of massive public spending would help jumpstart europe ’ s largest economy and could lead to growth of 1.0 to 1.5 percent growth , but the proposals were immediately dismissed by the government , economists and the german business community as being highly unrealistic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz “ they aren ’ t suggestions that particularly help the reforms at issue , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz on thursday .
“ their effect would be extremely questionable . ” budget deficit problem in particular , the dgb proposal to increase federal borrowing by € 7.5 billion is likely a non-starter for the government .
germany is required by european union rules to keep its budget deficit under three percent of its gross domestic product or face sanctions .
taking on the debt that the unions propose would likely present more trouble with brussels than berlin would be willing to risk . “ i think there were a lot of proposals that at the end of the day simply could never be financed , ” thomas straubhaar , the president of the hamburg-based hwwa economic institute , told ndr radio . schröder stuck to his reform course at a regional spd congress in hamburg on wednesday evening .
the government has organized four regional meetings to make its case for the reforms ahead of a special national spd congress on june 1 . “ if we don ’ t shape this process , than it will be shaped without us and people will be worse off , ” said schröder .

hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .

germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts . angered by the government ’ s proposed “ agenda 2010 ” package of economic reforms , the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- suggested investing € 15 billion -lrb- $ 17 billion -rrb- to cure the nation ’ s ills . at the core of the union plan are tax cuts and public spending to stimulate domestic demand , largely financed by increased government borrowing .
dgb chairman michael sommer said the union plan was an alternative to painful economic reforms proposed by german chancellor gerhard schröder . the government ’ s agenda 2010 calls for deep cuts in the welfare system and the loosening of germany ’ s strict job protection rules , which has led to heavy criticism from both the unions and left-wing members of schröder ’ s social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party . “ we don ’ t assume that cuts in social programs will stimulate the labor market , ” said sommer at a press conference to present the dgb plan .
“ germany finally needs solid policies for growth and employment . ” schröder ’ s refusal to alter from his reform course has opened up a nasty rift between the spd and the unions , a traditional constituency of the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.05.2003 berlin studio plays host to hollywood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackie chan busts a move on the streets of central berlin .
hollywood 's brightest stars land in berlin to remake a jules verne classic .
will the film be enough to save the city 's legendary but beleaguered babelsberg studios ? it 's not often that you see jackie chan on an antique red leather sofa flying out the window of the bank of england .
especially if the bank of england happens to be set in berlin .
but you would n't have been hallucinating if , passing through berlin 's central gendarmenmarkt square on tuesday , you thought you 'd stepped back in time to victorian london .
the square has been transformed into a replica of london 's trafalgar square and is the set of a new production of the jules verne classic " around the world in eighty days , " which began filming here this week .
with chinese action-film star jackie chan starring in the role of passpartout , british comedian steve coogan as phileas fogg , jim broadbent as lord kelvin , belgian actress cécile de france in the role of monique and oscar-winner kathy bates as queen victoria , the film will be star-studded .
officials in berlin are hoping the € 100 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- film - being produced jointly by walden media and studio babelsberg motion pictures - will help spur the local film industry .
the fabled babelsberg studios , meanwhile , is hoping " around the world " will be its rescue .
already , more than 6,000 locals have been hired as extras for the film and both film board berlin-brandenburg and the mitteldeutsche medien förderung have pumped subsidies into the production .
a fabled studio bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pianist " - studio babelsberg babelsberg studios -lrb- where , as the sign on the studio 's gates declares , " marlene dietrich crossed her lovely legs " -rrb- was legendary in the 1920s .
fritz lang 's " metropolis " was filmed there as well as the 1930 dietrich classic " the blue angel . "
after the fall of the berlin wall , the studio - which fell into disrepair under communist rule in the former east germany - was sold by the german government for $ 67 million to compagnie generale des eaux , now vivendi universal .
over the next decade , the company , with the aid of government subsidies , pumped a half-billion euros into renovating the studio , which is now considered a first-class filmmaking facility .
the company even hired star german director völker schlöndorff , who made the critically acclaimed film " the tin drum , " to run it for a time .
today , companies as varied as the public broadcaster orf and tvfilmstudios are based there .
despite those efforts , the studio under vivendi initially failed to attract hollywood-level projects .
more recently , however , roman polanski filmed his oscar-winning " the pianist " at babelsberg , and the battle of stalingrad epic " enemy at the gates , " starring jude law and ed harris , was also made there .
a sea of red ink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet despite the recent boost in high-profile projects , the studio has had a difficult history under vivendi .
the company has been scaling back its once ambitious babelsberg plans for a number of years now .
prior to its sale in 1992 - when it was still operated as defa studios , fully financed by the government in a structure stemming from the days of east german communist rule - more than 2,400 workers were employed at babelsberg .
now , there are about 178 working for the actual studio , but as many as 2,000 work for firms that have sprung up in the media center around the studio .
though babelsberg has enjoyed some successful years - including 2001 when it brought in € 33 million in revenues and produced six major films - it has never turned a profit under vivendi .
a second wind for berlin ?
the hope is that " around the world in eighty days " and other big-name productions will draw other filmmakers and studios to the city .
" obviously , the studio is not vivendi 's biggest priority at the moment and we , like the rest of the worldwide media industry are experiencing bad times , " babelsberg 's press spokesman , felix neunzerling told dw-world .
" we had a difficult year last year . . .
but getting big projects like the pianist and around the world in eighty days is something that the management here is working hard to achieve . "
bernd schiphorst , media representative for the states of berlin and brandenburg , is quick to point out the advantages of filming in berlin .
" it is cheaper than in the usa and england - especially in times where all the studios are suffering at the hands of heavy pricing competition , " he said .
but one mega-budget flick wo n't be enough to secure babelsberg 's long-term future .
" the studios need to continue attracting these big projects , " schiphorst said .
others are more candid about the state of the german film industry .
" the truth is that the german film industry is in a terrible mess .
over 80 percent of independent producers are bust or about to go bust , " a german film industry observer , who did not wish to be named , told dw-world .
" this is why it 's marvelous for babelsberg , to be able to say they have a big budget hollywood production .
but it could be that it 's a very expensive straight to video affair ...
jackie chan is not the kind of star who can carry a film outside his own fan club , " the observer continued .
babelsberg 's neunzerling , however , notes that every motion picture chan has starred in during the past 20 years has made its debut in a theater .
nor is the studio relying entirely on chan 's star power - the cast of " around the world in eighty days " also includes stars popular with other demographic groups including de france , winner of a césar , france 's equivalent to the oscar , and a bit part played by johnny knoxville , who caters to a younger audience that knows him from mtv 's popular " jackass " series .
a dubious future babelsberg 's future is also at the mercy of vivendi , which itself is in financial dire straits .
vivendi posted the biggest losses in french corporate history in march this year , when it announced it went € 23.3 billion into the red in 2002 .
last week , amid rumors that the firm would be soon cutting its hollywood ties , vivendi also announced it would be selling its vivendi universal entertainment businesses , which include film and television studios , a record label and a computer games arm .
although vivendi 's divestiture of universal does not mean the immediate end for babelsberg , which is owned by a separate vivendi daughter company , vivendi deutschland , speculation is rife as to when the axe will fall in potsdam .
last year , schlöndorff was quoted in the german press saying the end of babelsberg 's life under vivendi was nigh .
but the adoring crowds who gathered to watch chan 's antics on berlin 's gendarmenmarkt yesterday were simply interested in the magic of the movies taking place in front of them .
above the constant calls of " jackie !
jackie !
jackie ! , " many were thrilled by the filming going on in berlin .
" it 's like a big party , " one onlooker said .
" it 's wonderful . " ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the fire brigades union -lrb- fbu -rrb- said draft guidelines proposed savage cuts in the service which would undermine public safety .
the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- rejected the accusations and accused the union of causing unnecessary public anxiety .
the fbu said the changes would mean fewer firefighters attending incidents and the removal of the national standards for answering 999 calls .
these draft guidelines are a blueprint for massive cuts in the fire service john mcdonald , fbu the fbu 's executive council member for scotland , john mcdonald , said : " councils are embarking on a cuts plan that is unsurpassed in a public service in recent memory .
" they have dressed it up in the clothes of modernisation but it is decimation . "
but cosla refuted the accusations and condemned the union 's use of so-called " scare tactics " .
cosla president pat watters said : " once again i have to register my strong objections at the scare tactics being adopted by the fbu which do nothing but cause members of the public needless anxiety . "
' lives at risk ' mr mcdonald said more lives would be put at risk if the plans were put into operation , warning that fire deaths had already started to rise after a 20-year falling trend .
he said the idea of replacing the national minimum standards for responding to 999 calls - the so-called " safety net " - with local risk management plans would be disastrous .
" they are preparing a recipe for disaster in the fire service , " he said .
there is no massive cuts agenda pat watters , cosla " you can not have cuts of this magnitude in an already overstretched service without the lives of firefighters and the public being put at risk .
" these draft guidelines , alongside the job cuts already announced , are a blueprint for massive cuts in the fire service .
" the public should understand we are not accepting a pay rise funded by massive cuts in public safety . "
but mr watters said : " there is no massive cuts agenda - the move to integrated risk management plans is about effective targeting of resources , based on community need , delivering an improved service .
' misinformation ' " it is extremely unfortunate that at a time when we hoped for a constructive dialogue that could bring about a negotiated settlement to this long running and damaging dispute this sort of misinformation is being peddled by the fbu . "
general secretary of the scottish trades union congress , bill speirs , warned employers not to compromise their stated commitment to safety .
mr speirs claimed to have seen letters from scottish council leaders in the run-up to last week 's elections which stated : " any changes to the service including distribution of firefighters and appliances will require to demonstrate an improvement in public safety . "
he said : " this was a welcome commitment from the scottish employers .
" i look forward to them putting it into practice , whatever pressure may come from south of the border , because i am certain that any real consultation with the public will firmly reject putting money before lives . "

britain is well on track to meet kyoto 's target of reducing emissions by 12.5 % , compared to 1990 levels , the experts say .
but the uk may not make its own tougher target of 20 % , which government officials have insisted is attainable .
the targets on the six gases must be met between 2008 and 2012 .
friends of the earth say the report will not be all good for the government and that the experts ' report will call on the uk to do more - especially at its power stations .
rising emissions spokesman roger hickman said : " it is good britain is a leader in terms of climate change .
it brings us international standing but we should n't rest on our laurels .
" we 've got to do more ourselves .
our own emissions have actually risen during the last five or six years under the labour government .
" we are going to have to introduce more measures to crack down on pollution . "
mr hickman said measures to slightly increase petrol prices and tackle pollution from power stations were not radical .
" if the industrialised world continues to pollute , millions of people in the next 50 years are going to die as a result of natural disasters . "

britain is well on track to meet kyoto 's target of reducing emissions by 12.5 % , compared to 1990 levels , the experts say .
but the uk may not make its own tougher target of 20 % , which government officials have insisted is attainable .

it brings us international standing but we should n't rest on our laurels .

net profits for the 12 months to end-march were 212.5bn yen -lrb- £ 1.1bn ; $ 1.8bn -rrb- , compared with a loss of 116.2bn a year earlier .
in the next 12 months , the firm now forecasts a near-tripling in profits , at least partly because its losses from overseas operations now seem to be moderating .
even more importantly , it predicts that demand for 3g services - which allow faster downloads of multimedia services - will take off this year .
3g hopes over the past few years , docomo has spent more than 1.9 trillion yen for shares in several foreign carriers , aiming to use its shareholdings to spread its i-mode wireless internet technology .
but the strategy backfired as telecoms share prices plunged in 2001 , which forced docomo drastically to write down the value of its holdings .
in the meantime , however , the foundations for growth in high-speed wireless technology seem to have been laid .
docomo said it expected subscribers for its 3g service to total 1.46 million by march 2004 , up from 330,000 at the end of march this year .
as the pioneer of i-mode , the main precursor to the 3g services currently being rolled out around the world , docomo is pinning its hopes on a rapid take-up of the technology .
