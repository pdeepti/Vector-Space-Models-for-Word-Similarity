starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .
but it is likely to be a long time before german sheds a law that is hundreds of years old and adopt the shopping freedom cherished by brits and americans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutsche marks . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2003 germany extends shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans can now sleep in a little later on saturdays .
starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .
but it is likely to be a long time before german sheds a law that is hundreds of years old and adopt the shopping freedom cherished by brits and americans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutsche marks .

since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .

five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan . four german bundeswehr soldiers were killed saturday morning in a car bomb attack in kabul .
the german defense ministry confirmed that five people in total were killed in the suicide bombing and at least 30 more were injured , including afghan civilians .
german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and insidious act " aimed at throwing the country back into chaos .
he also offered his condolences to the families of the lost .
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with the families of our soldiers who have risked their health and lives in order to provide a better and peaceful future -lrb- for afghanistan , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance of international security assistance force near to the scene of an explosion in kabul .
press reports claimed a taxi packed with explosives detonated at 6:30 a.m. local time on a main kabul street near a bus that was carrying isaf soldiers .
" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .
at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .
from late summer , the government is considering sending dozens of soldiers to provide security in the western city of herat .
next week , a parliamentary exploratory committee will visit the region before taking a final decision .
german defense minister peter struck has said the extension of the mandate is crucial in order to ensure the safety of german aid workers who are helping to rebuild civil society in rural areas across afghanistan .
and on saturday , he said the government had no intention of removing troops following the incident .
" as i have suggested a number of times , the situation -lrb- in kabul -rrb- is neither secure nor stable .
our soldiers have been given comprehensive training and have been equipped for the mission in the country .
we will undertake every conceivable measure to protect our soldiers on this mission and to ensure their security . " but the influential head of the german armed forces trade union , bernhard gertz , warned that it was time to strengthen the isaf force or withdraw it completely from the region .
in a newspaper interview , gertz described afghanistan as a " powder keg " and said taliban and al qaeda forces were regrouping and growing stronger .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2003 germany extends shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans can now sleep in a little later on saturdays .
starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .

starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.

five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan . four german bundeswehr soldiers were killed saturday morning in a car bomb attack in kabul .
the german defense ministry confirmed that five people in total were killed in the suicide bombing and at least 30 more were injured , including afghan civilians .
german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and insidious act " aimed at throwing the country back into chaos .
he also offered his condolences to the families of the lost .
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with the families of our soldiers who have risked their health and lives in order to provide a better and peaceful future -lrb- for afghanistan , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance of international security assistance force near to the scene of an explosion in kabul .
press reports claimed a taxi packed with explosives detonated at 6:30 a.m. local time on a main kabul street near a bus that was carrying isaf soldiers .
" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .
at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .
from late summer , the government is considering sending dozens of soldiers to provide security in the western city of herat .
next week , a parliamentary exploratory committee will visit the region before taking a final decision .
german defense minister peter struck has said the extension of the mandate is crucial in order to ensure the safety of german aid workers who are helping to rebuild civil society in rural areas across afghanistan .
and on saturday , he said the government had no intention of removing troops following the incident .
" as i have suggested a number of times , the situation -lrb- in kabul -rrb- is neither secure nor stable .
our soldiers have been given comprehensive training and have been equipped for the mission in the country .
we will undertake every conceivable measure to protect our soldiers on this mission and to ensure their security . " but the influential head of the german armed forces trade union , bernhard gertz , warned that it was time to strengthen the isaf force or withdraw it completely from the region .
in a newspaper interview , gertz described afghanistan as a " powder keg " and said taliban and al qaeda forces were regrouping and growing stronger .
the killings follow the death of a bundeswehr soldier who died at the end of may after the isaf truck he was driving rolled over a mine . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .

at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .
from late summer , the government is considering sending dozens of soldiers to provide security in the western city of herat .
next week , a parliamentary exploratory committee will visit the region before taking a final decision .
german defense minister peter struck has said the extension of the mandate is crucial in order to ensure the safety of german aid workers who are helping to rebuild civil society in rural areas across afghanistan .
and on saturday , he said the government had no intention of removing troops following the incident .
" as i have suggested a number of times , the situation -lrb- in kabul -rrb- is neither secure nor stable .
our soldiers have been given comprehensive training and have been equipped for the mission in the country .
we will undertake every conceivable measure to protect our soldiers on this mission and to ensure their security . " but the influential head of the german armed forces trade union , bernhard gertz , warned that it was time to strengthen the isaf force or withdraw it completely from the region .
in a newspaper interview , gertz described afghanistan as a " powder keg " and said taliban and al qaeda forces were regrouping and growing stronger .
the killings follow the death of a bundeswehr soldier who died at the end of may after the isaf truck he was driving rolled over a mine . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .
but it is likely to be a long time before german sheds a law that is hundreds of years old and adopt the shopping freedom cherished by brits and americans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutsche marks . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutsche marks .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .

five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan . four german bundeswehr soldiers were killed saturday morning in a car bomb attack in kabul .
the german defense ministry confirmed that five people in total were killed in the suicide bombing and at least 30 more were injured , including afghan civilians .
german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and insidious act " aimed at throwing the country back into chaos .
he also offered his condolences to the families of the lost .
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with the families of our soldiers who have risked their health and lives in order to provide a better and peaceful future -lrb- for afghanistan , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance of international security assistance force near to the scene of an explosion in kabul .
press reports claimed a taxi packed with explosives detonated at 6:30 a.m. local time on a main kabul street near a bus that was carrying isaf soldiers .
" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .
at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .
from late summer , the government is considering sending dozens of soldiers to provide security in the western city of herat .
next week , a parliamentary exploratory committee will visit the region before taking a final decision .
german defense minister peter struck has said the extension of the mandate is crucial in order to ensure the safety of german aid workers who are helping to rebuild civil society in rural areas across afghanistan .
and on saturday , he said the government had no intention of removing troops following the incident .
" as i have suggested a number of times , the situation -lrb- in kabul -rrb- is neither secure nor stable .
our soldiers have been given comprehensive training and have been equipped for the mission in the country .
we will undertake every conceivable measure to protect our soldiers on this mission and to ensure their security . " but the influential head of the german armed forces trade union , bernhard gertz , warned that it was time to strengthen the isaf force or withdraw it completely from the region .
in a newspaper interview , gertz described afghanistan as a " powder keg " and said taliban and al qaeda forces were regrouping and growing stronger .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

press reports claimed a taxi packed with explosives detonated at 6:30 a.m. local time on a main kabul street near a bus that was carrying isaf soldiers .
" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .
at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .
from late summer , the government is considering sending dozens of soldiers to provide security in the western city of herat .
next week , a parliamentary exploratory committee will visit the region before taking a final decision .
german defense minister peter struck has said the extension of the mandate is crucial in order to ensure the safety of german aid workers who are helping to rebuild civil society in rural areas across afghanistan .
and on saturday , he said the government had no intention of removing troops following the incident .
" as i have suggested a number of times , the situation -lrb- in kabul -rrb- is neither secure nor stable .
our soldiers have been given comprehensive training and have been equipped for the mission in the country .
we will undertake every conceivable measure to protect our soldiers on this mission and to ensure their security . " but the influential head of the german armed forces trade union , bernhard gertz , warned that it was time to strengthen the isaf force or withdraw it completely from the region .
in a newspaper interview , gertz described afghanistan as a " powder keg " and said taliban and al qaeda forces were regrouping and growing stronger .
the killings follow the death of a bundeswehr soldier who died at the end of may after the isaf truck he was driving rolled over a mine . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .
but it is likely to be a long time before german sheds a law that is hundreds of years old and adopt the shopping freedom cherished by brits and americans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .
but it is likely to be a long time before german sheds a law that is hundreds of years old and adopt the shopping freedom cherished by brits and americans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2003 germany extends shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans can now sleep in a little later on saturdays .
starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .

starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .

" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutsche marks .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .

five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan . four german bundeswehr soldiers were killed saturday morning in a car bomb attack in kabul .
the german defense ministry confirmed that five people in total were killed in the suicide bombing and at least 30 more were injured , including afghan civilians .
german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and insidious act " aimed at throwing the country back into chaos .
he also offered his condolences to the families of the lost .
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with the families of our soldiers who have risked their health and lives in order to provide a better and peaceful future -lrb- for afghanistan , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance of international security assistance force near to the scene of an explosion in kabul .
press reports claimed a taxi packed with explosives detonated at 6:30 a.m. local time on a main kabul street near a bus that was carrying isaf soldiers .
" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .
at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .
from late summer , the government is considering sending dozens of soldiers to provide security in the western city of herat .
next week , a parliamentary exploratory committee will visit the region before taking a final decision .
german defense minister peter struck has said the extension of the mandate is crucial in order to ensure the safety of german aid workers who are helping to rebuild civil society in rural areas across afghanistan .
and on saturday , he said the government had no intention of removing troops following the incident .
" as i have suggested a number of times , the situation -lrb- in kabul -rrb- is neither secure nor stable .
our soldiers have been given comprehensive training and have been equipped for the mission in the country .

five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan . four german bundeswehr soldiers were killed saturday morning in a car bomb attack in kabul .
the german defense ministry confirmed that five people in total were killed in the suicide bombing and at least 30 more were injured , including afghan civilians .
german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and insidious act " aimed at throwing the country back into chaos .
he also offered his condolences to the families of the lost .
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with the families of our soldiers who have risked their health and lives in order to provide a better and peaceful future -lrb- for afghanistan , " schröder said .

press reports claimed a taxi packed with explosives detonated at 6:30 a.m. local time on a main kabul street near a bus that was carrying isaf soldiers .
" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .
at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .
from late summer , the government is considering sending dozens of soldiers to provide security in the western city of herat .
next week , a parliamentary exploratory committee will visit the region before taking a final decision .
german defense minister peter struck has said the extension of the mandate is crucial in order to ensure the safety of german aid workers who are helping to rebuild civil society in rural areas across afghanistan .
and on saturday , he said the government had no intention of removing troops following the incident .
" as i have suggested a number of times , the situation -lrb- in kabul -rrb- is neither secure nor stable .
our soldiers have been given comprehensive training and have been equipped for the mission in the country .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutsche marks .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2003 germany extends shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans can now sleep in a little later on saturdays .
starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .
but it is likely to be a long time before german sheds a law that is hundreds of years old and adopt the shopping freedom cherished by brits and americans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan . four german bundeswehr soldiers were killed saturday morning in a car bomb attack in kabul .
the german defense ministry confirmed that five people in total were killed in the suicide bombing and at least 30 more were injured , including afghan civilians .
german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and insidious act " aimed at throwing the country back into chaos .
he also offered his condolences to the families of the lost .
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with the families of our soldiers who have risked their health and lives in order to provide a better and peaceful future -lrb- for afghanistan , " schröder said .

press reports claimed a taxi packed with explosives detonated at 6:30 a.m. local time on a main kabul street near a bus that was carrying isaf soldiers .
" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .
at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .
from late summer , the government is considering sending dozens of soldiers to provide security in the western city of herat .
next week , a parliamentary exploratory committee will visit the region before taking a final decision .
german defense minister peter struck has said the extension of the mandate is crucial in order to ensure the safety of german aid workers who are helping to rebuild civil society in rural areas across afghanistan .
and on saturday , he said the government had no intention of removing troops following the incident .
" as i have suggested a number of times , the situation -lrb- in kabul -rrb- is neither secure nor stable .
our soldiers have been given comprehensive training and have been equipped for the mission in the country .
we will undertake every conceivable measure to protect our soldiers on this mission and to ensure their security . " but the influential head of the german armed forces trade union , bernhard gertz , warned that it was time to strengthen the isaf force or withdraw it completely from the region .
in a newspaper interview , gertz described afghanistan as a " powder keg " and said taliban and al qaeda forces were regrouping and growing stronger .
the killings follow the death of a bundeswehr soldier who died at the end of may after the isaf truck he was driving rolled over a mine . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2003 germany extends shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans can now sleep in a little later on saturdays .
starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .
but it is likely to be a long time before german sheds a law that is hundreds of years old and adopt the shopping freedom cherished by brits and americans . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutsche marks . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2003 germany extends shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans can now sleep in a little later on saturdays .
starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .

starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan . four german bundeswehr soldiers were killed saturday morning in a car bomb attack in kabul .
the german defense ministry confirmed that five people in total were killed in the suicide bombing and at least 30 more were injured , including afghan civilians .
german chancellor gerhard schröder condemned the bombing as a " cowardly and insidious act " aimed at throwing the country back into chaos .
he also offered his condolences to the families of the lost .
" in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with the families of our soldiers who have risked their health and lives in order to provide a better and peaceful future -lrb- for afghanistan , " schröder said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ambulance of international security assistance force near to the scene of an explosion in kabul .
press reports claimed a taxi packed with explosives detonated at 6:30 a.m. local time on a main kabul street near a bus that was carrying isaf soldiers .
" the bus supposedly pulled up next to the bus and then the bomb ignited , " an afghan police officer told german public television .
at least 33 people were traveling in the bus according to figures supplied by the german defense ministry .
the incident marked the first time german soldiers have been attacked since they were first deployed in afghanistan in january 2002 .
the crowded street were the bombing took place is home to kabul ’ s main isaf base , where about 2,000 german and dutch soldiers are stationed .
of the 4,500 soldiers in the isaf force that has provided security in afghanistan since the fall of the taliban , close to 2,500 are from the german bundeswehr .
force may extend beyond kabul the setback for the force comes just days after the german parliament said it would consider expanding the mandate of german soldiers in afghanistan beyond kabul .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .

his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2003 germany extends shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans can now sleep in a little later on saturdays .
starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.06.2003 germany extends shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans can now sleep in a little later on saturdays .
starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.
and though the new hours will be set in place on saturday , retailers are still clashing with unions over organized labor 's call for a 50 percent bonus for people who have to work the later hours on saturdays .
the atmosphere couldn ’ t be more different than in the united states , where unlimited shopping hours are a part of the history and mentality of the country .
even outside the urban centers , countless supermarkets are open around the clock .
malls and other shopping centers are also open to customers on sundays , and sunday shopping is a pastime .
in germany , laws regulating opening hours have been on the books since the 14th century .
back then , several cities passed laws banning shopping on sundays .
the spirit of the law was to ensure that workers would have at least one day free each week - a logic which persists to this very day .
but there are signs that such thinking may be changing .
a recent poll by the allensbach institute showed that two-thirds of germans favor eliminating the law that restricts shopping hours .
politicians are starting to react , too .
in berlin , the social democrats are demanding the complete elimination of the opening hours law in the populous city-state .
the business friendly free democrats have also long called for a lifting of the law .

starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away . as recently as march , the german service sector union ver.di was still campaigning against any loosening of the strict laws regulating shopping hours in the country .
the union described efforts by the government to extend opening hours as " anti-family , " claiming the move would lead to the elimination of jobs and come at the expense of existing employees .
ultimately , the union argued , extended shopping hours would lead to a culture-less , 24-hour society .
at a large demonstration in berlin , workers marched behind a banner with the slogan " weeks without end " scrawled across it .
sundays still taboo three months later , on saturday , june 7 , german shops are , for the first time , opening their doors for an additional four hours on saturdays – with shopping permitted until 8 p.m.
the protests died down months ago and even ver.di has buried its protest messages deep within its web site .
the move marks the biggest change in german shopping hours since 1996 , when weekdays shopping hours were extended from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
but sunday shopping is still a long way off since germany ’ s constitution forbids stores from opening on sundays .
advocates of extending shopping hours in germany didn ’ t have to look very far to find countries with more liberal policies .
as happened years ago in the united states , a number of european countries have loosened laws regulating when shops can be opened in recent years .
in england , stores can decide for themselves when they want to open .
the only major remaining restriction is that stores larger than 280 square meters can only open for six hours on sundays .
the law is intended to protect smaller , non-chain stores that might otherwise be competitively disadvantaged .
24-hour shopping france and spain also have consumer-friendly shopping regulations .
there shopping is permitted 24 hours a day on workdays .
but in the netherlands , shops must close by 10 p.m.
monday through saturday .
shops are also permitted to open on 12 sundays a year , but in larger cities like amsterdam and rotterdam , shops in the city center are open on most sundays .
however , the country ’ s extended shopping hours have been slow to catch on – though later shopping has been permitted since 1996 , only 2 percent of dutch shopkeepers choose to open later than 9 p.m.
on saturdays , many stores close even earlier – some as early as 5 p.m.
and only about 10 percent of the country ’ s stores take advantage of the so-called " shopping sundays . "
in germany , a similar reaction is expected .
in a recent survey , the german retailers ' association found that only 42 percent of shopkeepers planned to open their doors past 4 p.m. on saturdays , the time when stores closed prior to the loosening of the law .
of the stores planning to stay open past four , 90 percent said they would close by 6 p.m.

germany has been taken by storm by ' goodbye , lenin , ' a film in which east germany is humorously recreated from the ashes of history .
on friday , it won the country ’ s top film honor , the “ lola . ” the box-office hit " goodbye , lenin ! " won the 2003 german film prize on friday .
the tragicomidy about the fall of the ddr by director wolfgang becker won the € 500,000 golden " lola " award as well as six additional honors incdluing best actor nods for leads daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the film was also selected as audience favorite .
deutsche welle first covered the film at its smashing debut at the berlin international film festival earlier this year .
an update version is reprinted below . - nobody can quite explain the success of the film goodbye , lenin , which was first shown earlier this year at the berlin international film festival and has since risen to cult status among germany 's movie-going populations .
least of all , director wolfgang becker .
" cult ? " he said in a recent newspaper interview .
" when one always writes that , then a few people believe it .
ok , maybe it is cult , but that ’ s not the intention of the film . "
film enjoys success at box-office the modesty of his statement , however , belies the incredible box office success of the film .
since the film ’ s opening in february , close to 6 million germans , both in the eastern and western parts of the country , have flocked to movie theaters to see it .
it is the first german movie in history to enjoy such a successful start .
some 539 copies of the film have been distributed over the country to ensure that people never have to stand before " sold-out " signs .
in berlin , tourists can also enjoy the film with english subtitles at the glitzy potsdamer platz .
turning back the hands of time set in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the berlin wall , the movie is essentially a humorous attempt to turn back the wheel of time to the momentous autumn of 1989 .
christiane kerner -lrb- played by katrin sass -rrb- , a single mother and untiring supporter of the communist regime , suffers a heart attack when she learns that her son alex -lrb- played by daniel brühl -rrb- is arrested while participating in an anti-communist demonstration .
she falls into a coma and when she wakes up eight months later , the wall has come down , coca-cola signs cover the city , her children have replaced east german plywood with trendy western designs , and her daughter has hooked a west german boyfriend .
the mother 's doctor , however , warns the family that the slightest excitement could prove fatal for the mother , let alone the excitement of the collapse of " her " social system .
recreating east germany what follows are son alex ’ s clownish efforts to give his ailing mother the impression that her beloved east germany is still intact and flourishing .
the weakened mother is made to rest in a hastily redecorated east german room , complete with pea green wallpaper and trademark old cabinets lining the wall .
alex even manages to get an aspiring filmmaker friend to shoot editions for the aktuelle kamera - the news show in east germany - and then promptly plays it every evening for his mother , secretly on video .
the film , both funny and bittersweet , portrays life in east germany down to the last detail , whether it ’ s human relations , furniture , fashion , private or public rhetoric .
yearning for communist kitsch the deeply moving story , in turn hysterically funny and in turn pathetic , has touched a nerve in germany .
the film has been hailed by critics as having " united the easterners and westerners in laughter " , a " cathartic release " from the past and a " boost to east german ostalgie " - east german nostalgia for the past .
the overwhelming reaction to the film has also reinforced the west germans ’ enduring love-affair with communist kitsch , socialist chic , prefabricated apartment blocks and all things east german that are considered " cool " and " hip " today .
but director becker is clear that the aim of his film was not to make it appeal to the masses by being " cool . "
" the people have rediscovered east german clothes like nva -lrb- the east german army -rrb- track suits , they find east german design chic .
it has to do with recurring trends , with the retro-look .
but we didn ’ t want to serve any trend .
i was only interested in the perspective of the young man , " he said in a recent interview .
goodbye lenin spurs huge merchandising business but whether becker likes it or not , a whole merchandising industry has already sprung up around goodbye , lenin , feeding on the cult of the former east germany .
for € 250 -lrb- $ 276 -rrb- , one can rent " germany ’ s most famous living room " - the prefabricated apartment where the kerner family lives in the film .
the location has been billed as " the perfect place for a ostalgie party , " by a local tabloid .
renting the uniform of a east german police officer costs a € 55 a week .
one can also bid for an original goodbye , lenin coffee set at ebay on the internet , buy goodbye , lenin t-shirts or mugs or discuss the film with others in a special on-line forum .
certain movie theaters halls have even been asking viewers to bring along their east german souvenirs .
a theaterl in the dreary eastern berlin suburb of hellersdorf now sports old east german newspapers , confirmation certificates and faded east german scout t-shirts .
visitors could also pay for their tickets in the now defunct east german deutschmarks in the first week that the film opened .
becker has no personal baggage to carry the 48-year-old becker , who comes from the west german region of westphalia , had no personal connections to east germany .
his impressions were limited to visits every once in a while out of sheer curiosity .
that distance , he believes , is part of what made the film a success .
" i don ’ t have any ostalgie .
the whole thing wasn ’ t too strange to me .
we haven ’ t made a film about some distant lost culture .
east germany after all has to do with german mentality .
there wasn ’ t some different species that grew up there , " he told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
becker , who has made four feature films and a tv documentary to date , spent years researching goodbye , lenin .
his research included observing east germans , talking to them and watching countless videos .
" that ’ s when i understood that the typical east german life story doesn ’ t exist , not this one pattern .
some found their country a prison , you could still feel how strong the hate was .
others simply lived in there .
i wanted to get a feeling for the country , " becker told the paper .
becker still hasn ’ t come to terms with the overwhelming success of his film .
" i have happy moments .
but sometimes i think , everything is a big mistake .
that somebody has miscalculated and written the spectator numbers in two digits , like with euro and deutsche marks .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .

a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling . a survey commissioned by the konrad adenauer foundation in germany to study how people here perceive islam is set to shake the foundations of the widespread view that western societies are uncomfortable with the religion .
called " what do the germans think about islam ? " the study , which involved 1,000 western germans and just as many eastern germans , found that almost two-thirds of those questioned believed muslims living in germany should be allowed to practice their religion without any restrictions .
most of the 2,000 surveyed also showed themselves to be largely free of prejudice . ninety-one percent said they believed all people were equal before god and more than two-thirds rejected the notion that christianity was superior to islam .
ulrich von wilamowitz-möllendorff , who carried out the survey for the respected foundation which maintains close ties to germany ’ s conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , called the results " surprising . "
even emine demirbüken , who has worked as a commissioner for foreigner affairs in berlin for 15 years and oversaw the poll , told deutsche welle the results were unexpected .
" it surprised me positively because in the overall societal atmosphere , something different is shown .
that is , the germans are against islam , that they have nothing to do with it and that muslims living here are obliged to adapt and aren ’ t allowed to visibly practice their religion , " she said .
deep doubts about islam , too but the survey also uncovered some less comfortable findings .
almost half of those questioned doubted that islam was a tolerant religion , and 46 percent said they didn ’ t believe that islam and christianity represented the same values .
two-thirds opined that muslims living in germany should be more considerate towards germans while practicing their religion .
wilamowitz-möllendorff said tolerance towards islam was most conspicuous among the educated classes and among those germans who have contacts to fellow muslims .
germans from formerly communist eastern germany also showed more reservations than their counterparts in the west .
demirbüken said what ’ s needed is more intensive dialogue between muslims and germans .
" we urgently need a strong discussion , we need to deal with the topic islam more thoroughly .
but not as a political movement , rather islam as a religious tenet . "
cordial relations with close to 4 million muslims living in germany , islam is the third most commonly practiced religious faith in the country - after the protestantism and catholicism . though relations between germans and muslims have been largely peaceful , tensions have arisen in the past in the form of local resistance to the construction of mosques or disagreements over whether muslims may use loudspeakers in residential neighborhoods to call the faithful to prayer .
relations between the two communities faced additional strains after the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , in the u.s. and the subsequent discovery of the hamburg terror cell , where a handful of the perpetrators lived .
there have also been instances where german constitutional law has conflicted with islamic practices or raised issues of religious freedom , such as the recent case where a muslim teacher in the state of baden-würtemberg was forbidden from working because she refused to teach without a headscarf .
she has now taken her plea to the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , germany 's highest court .
" i find it very regrettable that the headscarf debate is being hustled into legal paragraphs and courts .
i also find it almost unbearable that it ’ s being touted as a symbolic act , " demirbüken said .
bridging the divide demirbüken thought that one way of bridging the gap would be for the german states to officially recognize and support islam studies the same way they endorse christian religious lessons .
currently islam religious lessons in schools , which are offered in some places in the state of north rhine-westphalia , are the prerogative of islamic organizations .
demirbüken said that ’ s precisely what makes islam a special case and hinders people from getting correctly informed about it .
" it would be ideal if one perceived and accepted the customs of this society -lrb- the muslims -rrb- , which includes the wearing of a headscarf , as normal .
but naturally that needs education , which first has to be rooted in schools , where someone wearing a headscarf would simply be accepted as a teacher and not as a person wearing a headscarf , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in brief germany 's highest court deliberates over teachers wearing headscarves ; 17 people are quarantined after having contact with a patient suspected of carrying sars ; germany 's environmentally-friendly insignia turns 25 -lrb- june 3 , 2003 -rrb- culture clash on german burial ground around 95 per cent of muslims living in germany choose not to be buried on german soil - due to high costs and germany 's strict burial laws .

the mother of one of the girls said the length of sentence was " disgusting " because her daughter would have to live with it for the " rest of her life " and the whole family was under a " dark cloud " .
