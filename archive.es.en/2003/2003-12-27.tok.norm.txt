german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "

though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .
siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.12.2003 german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the heart of the controversy - the plutonium plant in hanau , western germany .
german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "
there was no official response from siemens to the minister 's allegations .
nuclear deal threatens to split ruling coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in china trittin ’ s criticism of the nuclear deal is just the latest in a snowballing dispute that has threatened to cause a rift in the ruling coalition between chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partners , the anti-nuclear greens .
schröder agreed to sell the plutonium processing plant to beijing during a visit to china in early december -lrb- photo -rrb- .
though schröder says beijing has assured him the plant will not produce material for military purposes , the greens fear china could still use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
before the greens agreed to share power with schröder ’ s social democrats in 1998 , they insisted that germany abandon nuclear energy .
last month , the government moved to decommission the first of 18 nuclear power stations as part of the agreement .
the plutonium plant is based at hanau , western germany and was constructed in 1991 by siemens .
it was mothballed in 1995 without ever going into operation and still lies idle .

german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export . germany ’ s controversial € 50 million -lrb- $ 62 million -rrb- sale of a nuclear fuel-rod plant to china took a further twist on saturday when german environment minister jürgen trittin warned plant-maker and electronics giant siemens that it risked ruining its reputation if it pushed ahead with the export .
" the heads of the company must decide whether the ensuing image-loss is greater than the financial advantages of the deal , " trittin told german daily die welt .
the environment minister stressed that anti-nuclear demonstrators and citizens ’ initiatives would " not pass up the chance to once again brand siemens as a nuclear company " if the plant , designed to produce fuel elements from plutonium , was exported to china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded siemens of its separation from nuclear subsidiary kwu years ago and said the motive for the pull-out at the time had been the realization that " the nuclear business only amounted for five percent of the company ’ s profits , whereas it made up 50 percent of the criticism that siemens had to face . "
trittin also pointed out that two thirds of germans weren ’ t in favor of the export and added , " for a company that has a strong consumer orientation in mobile phones and computers , that is a definitive factor . "

siemens had previously offered to export the complete facility to russia in mid-2001 , but the plan sparked political concern and was eventually dropped .
export subsidies for nuclear technology questioned the planned export to beijing has also attracted the attention of brussels , which is probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
on saturday green member of the european parliament heidi rühle touched upon a new aspect of the issue and demanded the german government do away with export subsidies for nuclear technology .
rühle announced she would take up the matter with eu competition commissioner mario monti in january .
" we want to be clear about how far such subsidies hinder free competition , " she told ap .
rühle added that there was an impression that germany was phasing out nuclear energy at home , but german firms could still participate in constructing nuclear plants abroad . dw staff with wire material -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .

news online looks at the scale of the problem in the uk , and what action is being taken to tackle it .
how much gun crime is there ?
gun crime has increased in recent years , including a near doubling of handgun offences since 1996 , the year of the dunblane massacre .
in 2001-02 , there were some 22,300 firearms offences , a rise of almost a third on the previous year .
the number of people killed by firearms was 23 .
but while it may appear to be rife , it is generally confined to a large number of incidents perpetrated by a small number people in very small areas .
while this is of no comfort to those who may have witnessed gun crime on their own streets , those most likely to be victims are young men .
so who is carrying the guns ?
all the evidence suggests that gun crime is not the problem but a symptom of a huge and well established drugs economy .
the growth of gun crime in london has come with the rise in crack cocaine .
the worst of the crack dealing takes place in the poorest areas .
at present , the worst affected are some of london 's african-caribbean communities -lrb- hence the phrase of ' black-on-black crime ' -rrb- , centred predominantly among those of jamaican descent .
that said , there is great concern about rising gun use within other communities in london and elsewhere .
how have the police reacted ?
the first unit tasked with targeting gun crime perpetrated against black communities was the metropolitan police 's operation trident .
the unit was founded in 1998 after a spate of shootings in brent and lambeth .
there are now similar operations targeting gun crime in bristol , birmingham , manchester , nottingham and leeds , but they are not directly comparable to trident .
how effective have these operations been ?
the metropolitan police says the latest figures show trident is starting to pay dividends .
in 2002 , trident investigated 24 murders .
this year there have been 12 deaths - and in eight cases detectives have charged suspects .
since the beginning of this year , trident has seized 94 firearms , 1,906 rounds of ammunition and just over 5kg of class a drugs .
what about elsewhere ?
in the west midlands , operation ventara dealt with 2,161 firearms offences in the year to april 2003 - a 5 % drop on the previous 12 months .
specialist gun crime operations trident : london ventara : birmingham goodwood : manchester stealth : nottingham safeguard : leeds atrium : bristol however , during the same period , the number of firearms offences dealt with by west yorkshire police rose from 1,756 to just over 2,000 incidents .
in nottingham , operation stealth has made 350 arrests since september 2002 .
avon and somerset has seen more than 1,000 arrests since the introduction of operation atrium two-and-a-half years ago .
so is n't this all being run by ' yardie ' gangsters from jamaica ?
so-called yardie gangs were certainly involved in the growth of crack in the uk .
but lee jasper , chair of the trident advisory group , says the majority of those involved are now british-born .
as their drug trade has become more established , gangs have become more inclined to carry guns to command the respect of rivals , he said .
what about gun amnesties ?
the home office ran a month-long nationwide gun amnesty in april , partly as a response to the outcry following the killings of birmingham teenagers letisha shakespeare and charlene ellis in january .
more than 43,000 weapons were handed in to the police over that month - but critics say they were not the weapons on the streets .
in london 's case , there was an extremely poor response from each of the key trident areas .
so how else can this be tackled ?
community campaigners at the sharp end say much more needs to be done to prevent young men from poor areas being sucked into a gang culture which claims to provide respect and standing .
this work , they say , has to start at a much younger age .
secondly , london mayor ken livingstone wants the government to ban the sale of replica firearms .
in many cases , these " imitation " weapons are just a step away from being converted into live firearms - something detectives know is happening in london .
another frequent call by community activists is that more of the assets seized from drug dealers should be returned to communities to help regenerate the worst-off areas .
the government recently pledged to put £ 1.5m of seized assets back into areas worst affected by gun crime .

news online looks at the scale of the problem in the uk , and what action is being taken to tackle it .
how much gun crime is there ?
gun crime has increased in recent years , including a near doubling of handgun offences since 1996 , the year of the dunblane massacre .
in 2001-02 , there were some 22,300 firearms offences , a rise of almost a third on the previous year .
the number of people killed by firearms was 23 .
but while it may appear to be rife , it is generally confined to a large number of incidents perpetrated by a small number people in very small areas .
while this is of no comfort to those who may have witnessed gun crime on their own streets , those most likely to be victims are young men .
so who is carrying the guns ?
all the evidence suggests that gun crime is not the problem but a symptom of a huge and well established drugs economy .
the growth of gun crime in london has come with the rise in crack cocaine .
the worst of the crack dealing takes place in the poorest areas .
at present , the worst affected are some of london 's african-caribbean communities -lrb- hence the phrase of ' black-on-black crime ' -rrb- , centred predominantly among those of jamaican descent .
that said , there is great concern about rising gun use within other communities in london and elsewhere .
how have the police reacted ?
the first unit tasked with targeting gun crime perpetrated against black communities was the metropolitan police 's operation trident .
the unit was founded in 1998 after a spate of shootings in brent and lambeth .
there are now similar operations targeting gun crime in bristol , birmingham , manchester , nottingham and leeds , but they are not directly comparable to trident .
how effective have these operations been ?
the metropolitan police says the latest figures show trident is starting to pay dividends .
in 2002 , trident investigated 24 murders .
this year there have been 12 deaths - and in eight cases detectives have charged suspects .

news online looks at the scale of the problem in the uk , and what action is being taken to tackle it .
how much gun crime is there ?
gun crime has increased in recent years , including a near doubling of handgun offences since 1996 , the year of the dunblane massacre .
in 2001-02 , there were some 22,300 firearms offences , a rise of almost a third on the previous year .
the number of people killed by firearms was 23 .
but while it may appear to be rife , it is generally confined to a large number of incidents perpetrated by a small number people in very small areas .
while this is of no comfort to those who may have witnessed gun crime on their own streets , those most likely to be victims are young men .
so who is carrying the guns ?
all the evidence suggests that gun crime is not the problem but a symptom of a huge and well established drugs economy .
the growth of gun crime in london has come with the rise in crack cocaine .
the worst of the crack dealing takes place in the poorest areas .
at present , the worst affected are some of london 's african-caribbean communities -lrb- hence the phrase of ' black-on-black crime ' -rrb- , centred predominantly among those of jamaican descent .
that said , there is great concern about rising gun use within other communities in london and elsewhere .
how have the police reacted ?
the first unit tasked with targeting gun crime perpetrated against black communities was the metropolitan police 's operation trident .
the unit was founded in 1998 after a spate of shootings in brent and lambeth .
there are now similar operations targeting gun crime in bristol , birmingham , manchester , nottingham and leeds , but they are not directly comparable to trident .
how effective have these operations been ?
the metropolitan police says the latest figures show trident is starting to pay dividends .
in 2002 , trident investigated 24 murders .
this year there have been 12 deaths - and in eight cases detectives have charged suspects .
since the beginning of this year , trident has seized 94 firearms , 1,906 rounds of ammunition and just over 5kg of class a drugs .
what about elsewhere ?
in the west midlands , operation ventara dealt with 2,161 firearms offences in the year to april 2003 - a 5 % drop on the previous 12 months .
specialist gun crime operations trident : london ventara : birmingham goodwood : manchester stealth : nottingham safeguard : leeds atrium : bristol however , during the same period , the number of firearms offences dealt with by west yorkshire police rose from 1,756 to just over 2,000 incidents .
in nottingham , operation stealth has made 350 arrests since september 2002 .
avon and somerset has seen more than 1,000 arrests since the introduction of operation atrium two-and-a-half years ago .
so is n't this all being run by ' yardie ' gangsters from jamaica ?
so-called yardie gangs were certainly involved in the growth of crack in the uk .
but lee jasper , chair of the trident advisory group , says the majority of those involved are now british-born .
as their drug trade has become more established , gangs have become more inclined to carry guns to command the respect of rivals , he said .
what about gun amnesties ?
the home office ran a month-long nationwide gun amnesty in april , partly as a response to the outcry following the killings of birmingham teenagers letisha shakespeare and charlene ellis in january .
more than 43,000 weapons were handed in to the police over that month - but critics say they were not the weapons on the streets .
in london 's case , there was an extremely poor response from each of the key trident areas .
so how else can this be tackled ?
community campaigners at the sharp end say much more needs to be done to prevent young men from poor areas being sucked into a gang culture which claims to provide respect and standing .
this work , they say , has to start at a much younger age .
secondly , london mayor ken livingstone wants the government to ban the sale of replica firearms .
in many cases , these " imitation " weapons are just a step away from being converted into live firearms - something detectives know is happening in london .
another frequent call by community activists is that more of the assets seized from drug dealers should be returned to communities to help regenerate the worst-off areas .

the 184-page manual for the treo 600 smartphone suggests that life has become very complex indeed .
now for most men , delving into such an instruction book is forbidding and instinctively alien .
so , like most men , i did not .
but getting this cut-down device up and running could not have been simpler , even without reference to the manual .
plugged in and charged up it worked straight out of the box , with not an ip address in sight .
teamed with orange in the uk , the palm-based treo reinforces the old kiss principle of " keep it simple , stupid " .

a cuban parliament statement called the leased us facility a " concentration camp " and said inmates were subjected to " indescribable humiliations " .
the comments add to growing concern over the rights of those being held .
over 600 men detained in afghanistan , pakistan and elsewhere on suspicion of terrorism are being held there .
' illegal lease ' the prisoners are " totally isolated , without the possibility of communicating with their families or access to appropriate legal defence , " the cuban statement said .
" they commit very serious attacks on human dignity , in an atmosphere of hysteria and fear nurtured by north america 's far-right , " it continued .
the guantanamo bay base is leased under an agreement signed before fidel castro took power in 1959 .
the cuban leader routinely describes that agreement as illegal and pointedly refuses to cash the cheques for rental which the us sends every year .
no legal rights until now cuba has not been overtly critical of the us decision to hold terror suspects at the base , says the bbc 's steven gibbs in havana .
indeed it surprised many observers by offering logistical and medical assistance , our correspondent says .
the us maintains that the prisoners are being well treated .
the bush administration has said the men have no rights to the american legal system because they are being held in a foreign land .
as the us government has classified the men as " enemy combatants " , rather than prisoners of war , they are not given all the protections of the geneva conventions .
the prisoners have so far not been charged .

built out of mud bricks , clay straw and the trunks of palm trees , it is said to have been the largest structure of its kind in the world .
but a large part of the historic citadel has been destroyed .
most of the monuments visited every year by thousands of tourists date back to the 16th and 17th centuries , the heyday of the safavid dynasty .
but they too have been badly damaged by the earthquake that struck the south eastern city on friday 26 december .
" the city of bam must be built from scratch , " said its governor ali shafiee .
trading post during the safavid period -lrb- 1501 -1736 -rrb- , bam occupied six square kilometres and was surrounded by a rampart with 38 towers .
it had a population of between 9,000 and 13,000 .

most of it originates in the us but other like nations such as romania are becoming hotbeds for online scamming , as technology correspondent clark boyd reports from bucharest .
the friday night scene in the bar at bucharest 's polytechnic university is a lot like any other college bar scene .
some students knock back a few beers .
others enjoy a game of pool .
in another corner of the bar sit a dozen high-end desktop computers , complete with high-speed internet connections .
this is where the real action or maybe the virtual action , is .
students sit three-deep waiting to get on a machine .
for less than a dollar an hour , they can check e-mail , chat online , and listen to music .
most of them , however , are playing violent video games .
gaming aside , the youths who study computer science here are very good .
in fact , romania 's a global powerhouse when it comes to computing and programming .
pool of skills it is a tradition that stretches back to the early days of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu , according to florin talpes , who was a computer programmer during the ceausescu years .
" ceausescu had ambitions , " said mr talpes , " maybe he dreamed that romania could be a power .
in fact , in the 70s , ceausescu wanted to build a very modern romania , very well connected to technology . "
" a lot of times they do n't feel they 're actually committing a crime .
it 's more of an opportunity .
if you send them your money , you 're sort of responsible " julia mickey wilson , internet fraud complaint centre according to the computer programmer , ceausescu succeeded .
" on the technical side , romania has tens and tens of years of building these skills , so we have a huge human resource pool with good technical skills .
so , the romanians love the technical side , it 's in our genes to work on the technical side . "
those skills have got romanians noticed in europe and the us .
many romanian programmers have been lured away to work at software companies outside of their homeland .
romania 's stagnant economy has meant that those who stay behind find it hard to make an honest living in computers .
economic hardship is causing some of those talented youths in bucharest 's net cafes to turn to hacking and other forms of internet crime , according to andrew mclaughlin of harvard university 's berkman center for internet and society .
" there 's a significant number of very talented , very inventive hackers inside romania who , you know , are good at scamming people elsewhere , " he said .
" and it 's a real problem for romania .
it does n't want to become a haven for internet crime . "
online fraud but romania 's reputation as a haven for internet crime is growing , thanks to a number of recent , high-profile cases .
in one instance , romanians hacked into a server at the south pole research center and stole sensitive information .
they then blackmailed the centre , threatening to share that research data with other countries if they did not get their money .
romanians seem to be truly coming into their own as cyber-criminals in online auction scams , with the country ranking high in ebay 's table of estimated fraud risk .
julia mickey wilson , a specialist with the internet fraud complaint center , a joint initiative between the fbi and the national white collar crime center , says some romanians set up fake internet auction sites and accounts . "
it 's 15 years of jail is someone is trespassing on my property here in romania .
it 's the same on the internet " varujan pambuccian , member of parliament they then get unsuspecting americans to send them money for products that do not actually exist .
" a lot of times they do n't feel they 're actually committing a crime , " she said .
" it 's more of an opportunity - if you send them your money , you 're sort of responsible , i think they have a mind set that they kind of look at it like that . "
but romanian authorities are now fighting back .
computer programmer varujan pambuccian , a member of the romanian parliament , says that for too long , young computer workers in romania have thought that hacking and writing viruses was a resume builder , the first step toward landing a well-paying computer security job .
he believes it is time to send a different message to young , computer-savvy romanians .
" we are trying first of all to explain to them that nobody is hiring anymore hackers , " said mr pambuccian .
" we 're trying to explain to them now that this is not a way of finding better jobs .
this is a way of finding better jails . "
targeting cyber-crime the politician wrote and pushed through romania 's recently passed cyber-crime law .
it is , he says , very punitive and very simple .
" we 've translated the laws from the real world into the cyber world .
because a site is my home in cyberspace , and if someone is trying to force my door , it 's the same as an illegal intrusion .
" it 's 15 years of jail is someone is trespassing on my property here in romania .
it 's the same on the internet . "
tough law-making has been reinforced through the creation of a special cyber-crime unit within romania 's national police .
it is headed by virgil spiridon , who has been working with the fbi and other western european police agencies to tackle cyber-crime .
" i think the way we could resolve the problem is to make some programs in which these young people have something to create , " he says .
" we should n't give them time to think about ways to do internet crime .
and i think the private sector should do that , not only the police . "
the romanian authorities hope that legislation , enforcement and technology can make the country a leader in the fight against cyber-crime .
the fbi has praised romanian authorities for their efforts .
us officials have even suggested that romania could serve as a model for the whole of eastern europe .

economic hardship is causing some of those talented youths in bucharest 's net cafes to turn to hacking and other forms of internet crime , according to andrew mclaughlin of harvard university 's berkman center for internet and society .
" there 's a significant number of very talented , very inventive hackers inside romania who , you know , are good at scamming people elsewhere , " he said .
" and it 's a real problem for romania .
it does n't want to become a haven for internet crime . "
online fraud but romania 's reputation as a haven for internet crime is growing , thanks to a number of recent , high-profile cases .
in one instance , romanians hacked into a server at the south pole research center and stole sensitive information .
they then blackmailed the centre , threatening to share that research data with other countries if they did not get their money .
romanians seem to be truly coming into their own as cyber-criminals in online auction scams , with the country ranking high in ebay 's table of estimated fraud risk .
julia mickey wilson , a specialist with the internet fraud complaint center , a joint initiative between the fbi and the national white collar crime center , says some romanians set up fake internet auction sites and accounts .
it 's 15 years of jail is someone is trespassing on my property here in romania .
it 's the same on the internet varujan pambuccian , member of parliament they then get unsuspecting americans to send them money for products that do not actually exist .
" a lot of times they do n't feel they 're actually committing a crime , " she said .
" it 's more of an opportunity - if you send them your money , you 're sort of responsible , i think they have a mind set that they kind of look at it like that . "
but romanian authorities are now fighting back .
computer programmer varujan pambuccian , a member of the romanian parliament , says that for too long , young computer workers in romania have thought that hacking and writing viruses was a resume builder , the first step toward landing a well-paying computer security job .
he believes it is time to send a different message to young , computer-savvy romanians .
" we are trying first of all to explain to them that nobody is hiring anymore hackers , " said mr pambuccian .
" we 're trying to explain to them now that this is not a way of finding better jobs .
this is a way of finding better jails . "
targeting cyber-crime the politician wrote and pushed through romania 's recently passed cyber-crime law .
it is , he says , very punitive and very simple .
" we 've translated the laws from the real world into the cyber world .
because a site is my home in cyberspace , and if someone is trying to force my door , it 's the same as an illegal intrusion .
" it 's 15 years of jail is someone is trespassing on my property here in romania .
it 's the same on the internet . "
tough law-making has been reinforced through the creation of a special cyber-crime unit within romania 's national police .
it is headed by virgil spiridon , who has been working with the fbi and other western european police agencies to tackle cyber-crime .
" i think the way we could resolve the problem is to make some programs in which these young people have something to create , " he says .
" we should n't give them time to think about ways to do internet crime .
and i think the private sector should do that , not only the police . "
the romanian authorities hope that legislation , enforcement and technology can make the country a leader in the fight against cyber-crime .
the fbi has praised romanian authorities for their efforts .
us officials have even suggested that romania could serve as a model for the whole of eastern europe .

tough law-making has been reinforced through the creation of a special cyber-crime unit within romania 's national police .
it is headed by virgil spiridon , who has been working with the fbi and other western european police agencies to tackle cyber-crime .
" i think the way we could resolve the problem is to make some programs in which these young people have something to create , " he says .
" we should n't give them time to think about ways to do internet crime .
and i think the private sector should do that , not only the police . "
the romanian authorities hope that legislation , enforcement and technology can make the country a leader in the fight against cyber-crime .
the fbi has praised romanian authorities for their efforts .
us officials have even suggested that romania could serve as a model for the whole of eastern europe .
