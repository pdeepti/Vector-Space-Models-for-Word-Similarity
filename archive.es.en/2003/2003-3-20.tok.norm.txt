as the deadline approached , us-led combat troops in the gulf - numbering about 150,000 - took up battle positions for an imminent invasion of iraq .

it seems the raids may not have been the huge " shock and awe " attacks which the pentagon had planned .
but they may have been an attempt to " take out " the iraqi leadership when an opportunity presented itself .
key maps click here for detailed maps of iraq this morning , in a specially extended programme , breakfast brought you all the latest developments from around the world .
we reported live from baghdad , from northern iraq and from british forward positions in northern kuwait .
breakfast spoke to the defence secretary geoff hoon about the first night of attacks he said the british government were n't surprised by the attack .
" we were fully informed and involved in the process . "
" fully informed and involved " mr hoon denied that the uk 's contribution was only important diplomatically , rather than militarily .
he said the strikes are part of a wider campaign which will get underway very shortly .
" british forces are ready .
" i have seen the excellence of their preparations and it 's fair to say , they are ready to go , " he told us .
click here to see our interview with the defence secretary geoff hoon we spoke to simon turner , a former raf pilot , who has previously flown missions in iraq 's no-fly zone .
" at the time of any mission , the guys are focused on the targets and getting the weapons in the right place at the right time , " he told us .
" the more proficient they are in hitting the target , the less they 're likely to do collateral damage . "
click here to see our interview with simon turner and we heard from jo spear from the war studies department at kings college .
she 's in no doubt that the man who appeared on tv immediately after the attacks was saddam hussein , because he appeared older and more jowly than some of his doubles .
" this is n't the shock and awe attack we were expecting , " she told us .
" it could have been an audacious attempt to deal with the problem in iraq , which is the leadership not the people , " click here to see that interview we spoke to the man who was defence secretary during the 1991 gulf war , lord king .
" you are now going to see the hunt for saddam hussein , " he predicted .
" i expect weapons of mass destruction to be found which have been concealed all this time .
he said there would be a hunt for saddam and this would be helped by advances in technology compared with 1991 .
" well respected " special forces saddam escaped during the last gulf war but he said the us and uk forces would react to any intelligence .
lord king also said that an air campaign was likely to be shorter than last time , meanwhile our special forces are well respected and make a special contribution .
click here to see our interview with lord king the conservative party gave its reaction to events .
we heard from michael ancram who is the shadow foreign secretary he said he thought the first move would be a surprise move against command and control targets .
the attacks have given a clear warning to saddam hussein and those around him that they are targets and will be pursued .
he added " we support mr blair because he is acting in the national interest and as long as he is we support him ... it is necessary to eliminate saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction " click here to see our interview michael ancram the families back home the families of those serving in the gulf are following events closely back home .

two new websites will provide road users with an online database of potential car sharers to maximise people 's travel options .
the service will put people travelling in the same direction or to a similar destination in contact with each other , allowing them to arrange to travel together and share costs .
people using the free services can contact suitable travelling companions via e-mail and arrange to meet at a convenient location .
as we live in a rural area , many people rely on their cars to get around david morrish , devon county council larger employers and groups will also have the opportunity to set up private groups .
to join the scheme people simply have to log on to the websites and register their details .
journeys do not necessarily have to be for work .
the service can also be used for taking children to school or shopping .
devon county council is introducing www.carsharedevon.com , in partnership with plymouth city council and torbay council , on 24 march .
practical solution devon county councillor david morrish said : " as we live in a rural area , many people rely on their cars to get around .
" car sharing is the most practical solution for those who wish to reduce the number of journeys they make by car , even if it 's just one day a week .

continental , the fifth-largest carrier in the united states , said it would axe 1,200 posts by the end of the year , " retire " 25 % of its top management and look " in every nook and cranny " to achieve further savings .
asian travel operators , meanwhile , have warned that the conflict in iraq is seriously denting their business .
in japan , overseas holiday bookings are sharply down in the run-up to golden week , the high-point of the country 's holiday season .
industry in trouble a slump in travel after the terror attacks on september 11 , rising fuel prices , intense competition from budget airlines and now the war in iraq have all contributed to the difficulties of the travel industry .
in the united states two carriers , united airlines and us airways , have already sought bankruptcy protection , and some analysts have warned that the country 's top airline , american , might follow .
in other countries , many airlines are suffering as well .
earlier this week australia 's qantas cut 1,000 jobs , on top of 1,500 workers made redundant a month earlier .
now the airline says that demand for international travel is expected to slump by 15 % to 20 % .
air new zealand was also pessimistic , saying that passenger numbers were down by up to 10 % on key international routes .
japanese airlines have also been hit hard , with flag carrier jal warning that it will fly in a loss this year .
and in japan the whole travel sector is under pressure .
japan 's longest holiday season , golden week , starts at the end of april and is normally the busiest time for overseas travel .
but this year bookings are down by between 25 % to 40 % , said hitoshi sato of nippon travel agency : " we are in a severe situation .
we have seen consistent falls in bookings for overseas travel as fears of war loom . " .
continental ' will survive ' continental hopes that a raft of small savings will add up to enough of a cushion to survive the downturn .
continental hopes to fly past bankruptcy paper tickets will be abolished worldwide by june 2004 , contracts with suppliers will be renegotiated , and there will be talks to reduce airport and landing fees .
" we 're not going to just sit idly by and wait for others to save us " , said gordon bethune , continental 's chairman and chief executive .
bookings on transatlantic flights have been particularly hard hit , the company said .
continental has already put 4,300 workers on temporary unpaid leave , but for now has no plans for pay cuts for the rest of its staff .
several of continental 's larger rivals have held torturous negotiations with their staff over cutbacks in pay and pensions .
" this company is going to be a survivor " , mr bethune promised .
but he sounded a note of warning : a drawn-out conflict in iraq lasting more than a month could create problems that would make more cost cutting necessary .

taking office as us missiles began to fall on baghdad , the new bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui walked straight into a meeting of a special committee to work out what the war might do to japan 's fragile economy .
as well as " closely monitoring " developments , the central bank plans to inject 1 trillion yen into the economy by buying up government bonds .
the action echoed moves by governments and banks across asia to reassure their markets , amid fears that economic growth will crumble if exports to the us and elsewhere are hit by the uncertainty surrounding military action .
in seoul , the south korean central bank said it would not cut interest rates , but would buy up bonds to help banks and credit card companies still in turmoil after last week 's massive accounting scandal at sk group .
wash and brush up march is traditionally the time when the public and private sector in japan colludes to make sure that corporate finances look as good as possible for the end of the financial year on 31 march .
that task has proved particularly difficult this year , in the wake of government promises - admittedly largely unfulfilled - of radical reform to tackle more than a decade of economic stagnation .
but the international crisis has given legislators from japan 's ruling party a cue to bring forward measures they hope will make life easier for companies whose balance sheets have been hammered by stock markets falling to 20-year lows .
after a meeting of the ruling coalition , officials from the dominant liberal democratic party said they had agreed to drop plans to force companies to price their assets at market value .
the plan to require so-called " mark-to-market " valuations had been intended to force companies to come clean about the real state of their finances .
the government hoped that this would encourage reform and speed up the business of cleaning up the hundreds of trillions of yen in bad debts crippling the banking system .
but now , ldp official hideyuki aizawa told reporters , firms could choose whether to keep their " book-value " asset valuations - the price they paid for them - or to switch to the more realistic market price .

the institution of civil engineers -lrb- ice -rrb- said the government must lobby for more international air routes out of belfast and better sea links .
the organisation criticised the approach taken to flood management and water quality in a report published on thursday .
it said water and wastewater infrastructure was now at breaking point and the government should consider direct water charges to customers .
progress on developing the roads network meant Â£ 145m was now needed for maintenance , said the report .
the shortage of skilled professionals currently affecting the engineering profession means there are too few engineers to carry infrastructure improvements ice halting and reversing network deterioration required funding approaching Â£ 85m per year , said the ice .
its report - agenda for change - calls for a flagship cross-city rapid transit link for belfast and an assessment of sea and air links over the next 30 years .
the shortage of skilled professionals currently affecting the engineering profession meant there were too few engineers to carry out necessary infrastructure improvements , said the authors .
among their other recommendations are : acceptance of northern ireland 's regional transport strategy being matched by a commitment to provide sufficient funding over next 10 years early enactment of northern ireland 's planning amendment and strategic planning bills to translate policy into action production and local development of the belfast metropolitan area plan , and plans for other areas production of a clear inventory of brownland sites for regeneration and redevelopment the extension of the northern ireland climate change levy beyond 2006 the report said : " northern ireland risks becoming a victim of its own good work in recent years .
" encouraging progress on the 25,000 kilometre road and footpath network has witnessed the construction of new by-passes and improvements to some of the country 's key strategic corridors .
" the price of this progress is a growing backlog of maintenance work - now standing at Â£ 145m of work . "
' additional funding ' however , it said funding was not the only issue which needed addressed .
encouraging infrastructure developments provided real hope that public transport could become " a truly viable alternative mode of transport in the province " , it said .
international travel links - vital in attracting industry , tourism and inward investment - have suffered since the 11 september terrorist attack ice however , further measures were needed to consolidate and further the progress already made , said the ice .
substantial additional funding from public and private sources had to be devoted to public transport , it said .
" the situation is most acute in rail spending where long-term funding must be provided to reverse a history of under-investment .
" international travel links - vital in attracting industry , tourism and inward investment - have suffered since the 11 september terrorist attack . "
industrial expansion the institution said reductions in british airways ' service and the september 2002 announcement of the decision to sell belfast city airport raised serious concerns .
it called for further action to be taken to " protect the people of northern ireland from flooding " and recommended avoiding building on flood plains .
ice is concerned over reductions in british airways services on water for consumption , the ice said northern ireland was " facing an acute situation with little or no safety margin to cope with increased demand , industrial expansion or climate change in many areas " .
" inadequate funding means that northern ireland lags way behind both england and wales in its attempts to comply with european union directives .
" the effects of under-investment are there for all to see - we suffer from high levels of leakage , cryptosporidium infection and frequent out-of-sewer flooding .
" development in many towns is being held back because inadequate sewage disposal facilities are in place and this problem is therefore having a serious financial impact on the development of the country . "

challenger tanks of the royal scots dragoon guards are helping spearhead the move into iraq , backed by the 1st battalion , the black watch .
both are part of the 7th armoured brigade , better known as the desert rats .
among the tasks of the dragoon guards is reconnaissance , sniffing out saddam hussein 's initial lines of defence .
sergeant frank mack , from leith , is leading a section into southern iraq to collate information vital to commanders as they decide how and where to deploy challenger 2 tanks .
' timely information ' he said : " we aim to provide accurate and timely information so that a general picture of what lies over the border can be built up .
" we are generally the first to come across any obstacles which might lie in the path of the battlegroup , such as rivers or anti-tank minefields . "
lance corporal bruce barclay , from oldmeldrum , aberdeenshire , said the time was right for america and britain to strike .
a challenger tank heads north " saddam has had enough time and now he 's really starting to take the mickey , " he stated .
there is clearly a good-going banter among the scottish troops .
sgt mack said : " there are boys from the east and west of scotland here .
" the lads from the east are the brains behind the operation , while the glaswegian and west coast boys provide the brawn . "
however , his theory is discounted by corporal john rigby , from easterhouse .
" without the boys from glasgow , the whole thing would collapse ! "
' stay at home ' the desert rats are handing out thousands of leaflets promising safe treatment to surrendering iraqi soldiers .
other leaflets telling civilians to stay at home and offering food , water and help are also being distributed by the army .
the latter feature a picture of a british soldier with his right arm placed across his chest - a traditional arab sign of friendship - above the words : " for the moment stay away from combat troops . "
another leaflet is intended to direct those who do flee towards refugee camps .
there is a lot of anticipation here wing commander david bye raf lossiemouth it depicts a ration pack , a bottle of water and a road sign on one side and a map on the other .
instructions say : " for food , water and help follow the sign below " .
major aidan stephen , who is organising humanitarian relief for the royal scots dragoon guards battlegroup , said that the leaflets would help reduce casualty numbers and prevent unnecessary suffering .
" our emphasis will be on trying to save as many iraqi lives as possible .
" these leaflets seek to make it clear that it is the iraqi regime , not the people , that we are fighting . "
tornado ground and air attack planes from raf lossiemouth and raf leuchars are in operation .
there are about 100 planes from lossiemouth , leuchars and kinloss in the gulf .
