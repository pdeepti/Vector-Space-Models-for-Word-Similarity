the demand for information was so high that the tourist office had to have more brochures printed after they distributed all 15,000 of the german and english language pamphlets they had on hand . the then chancellor 's vacation plans caused many to do a retake .
visitors to the hanover world exposition in 2000 who were too busy to take in what else the city had to offer missed out on a good opportunity .

situated on masch lake in the midst of hanover , the sprengel museum has one of the world 's best collections of 20th century art , covering works from german expressionism to french cubism to conceptual art . it also houses a collection of work by kurt schwitters , including a reconstruction of the artist 's legendary " merzbau . "
schwitters devoted decades to his self-proclaimed life 's work and from 1923 to 1936 created a grotto-like structure in his hanover apartment .
the building was destroyed in an air raid in 1943 , but by then the artist had already gone into exile in oslo , norway , where he had started work on another merzbau in 1937 . niki 's notorious nanas the sprengel museum also houses a collection of more than 400 works from pop artist niki de saint phalle .
since the mid-1970s niki de saint phalle 's name has been intertwined with that of hanover , ever since the french artist raised the ire of many hanoverians by installing her notorious nanas along the riverside . the three brightly-colored buxom polyester statues sparked a lively debate about public art in the city .
but they survived , eventually becoming a symbol for the city on the river leine .
in 1999 , niki de saint phalle began redesigning the grotto , a 17th century structure in the famous royal herrenhausen gardens .

busch was a 19th century humorist and illustrator .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .

statutory health insurance premiums amount to 10.25 percent of gross income , almost a third less than german citizens pay .
france the french public health system was rated as the best in the world by the world health organization in 2000 .
the state plays a key role in this much-lauded model .
it controls the network between the financial institutions , doctors and patients .
since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .
the same rules apply to freelancers and civil servants .
germany ranks third in global comparisons of per head health costs .
the netherlands except in emergencies , all patients in the netherlands must first visit a general practitioner -lrb- gp -rrb- of their choice when they have health problems .
only gp ’ s can decide when a patient should treated by to a specialist or a hospital .
but the patient can choose which specialist or hospital to go to .
only around six percent of patients are actually referred elsewhere though , since dutch gp ’ s receive excellent training and are required to regularly undergo further training .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to 10.25 percent of gross income , almost a third less than german citizens pay .
france the french public health system was rated as the best in the world by the world health organization in 2000 .
the state plays a key role in this much-lauded model .
it controls the network between the financial institutions , doctors and patients .
since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .
to balance it out , statutory health insurance premiums are largely shouldered by employers , while employees pay only around 0.75 percent of their salaries .
united kingdom the national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- in the united kingdom is state-backed and financed entirely by health insurance contributions .
medical services are poor in comparison to other western european countries : waiting for an appointment for an operation can take up to 18 months .
thus many patients are flown to germany or france for treatments .
older patients must sometimes do without vital services .
for example , insurance coverage no longer includes artificial hip replacements for people over 60 .
patients may take out additional private insurance policies to cover services the nhs does not provide , such as alternative treatments in an private clinics .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to at least 10 percent of gross pay .
switzerland switzerland is one of the countries with the highest concentration of doctors in the world - a total of 14,000 - and medical treatment is considered to be among the best available .
since 1996 , swiss citizens have been required to take out health insurance policies with one of 100 insurance companies .
the companies are bound to relatively liberal regulations regarding the services they offer , which are monitored by a federal authority .
in addition , citizens may choose from diverse insurance models .
premiums are tied to income levels , and patients must pay a contribution from their own pockets during each visit to the doctor . ali akinci send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers .
-lrb- july 22 , 2003 -rrb- calling all citizens to pay up following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " .

from top art collections to a great zoo , there 's something for everyone . frequently overlooked in the past , the capital of lower saxony made the most of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to spend his 2003 summer vacation at home in hanover .
a local store owner sold hundreds of t-shirts printed with " kanzlerstadt " -lrb- chancellor 's city -rrb- .
the demand for information was so high that the tourist office had to have more brochures printed after they distributed all 15,000 of the german and english language pamphlets they had on hand . the then chancellor 's vacation plans caused many to do a retake .
visitors to the hanover world exposition in 2000 who were too busy to take in what else the city had to offer missed out on a good opportunity .
they may have thought there was n't anything more to see since few old buildings survived allied bomb raids during world war ii . grottos galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niki de saint phalle 's blue room in the herrenhausen gardens but art connoisseurs , in particular , will get their money ’ s worth when they stop here for a short break on their way to the better-visited art scenes in hamburg and berlin .
situated on masch lake in the midst of hanover , the sprengel museum has one of the world 's best collections of 20th century art , covering works from german expressionism to french cubism to conceptual art . it also houses a collection of work by kurt schwitters , including a reconstruction of the artist 's legendary " merzbau . "
schwitters devoted decades to his self-proclaimed life 's work and from 1923 to 1936 created a grotto-like structure in his hanover apartment .
the building was destroyed in an air raid in 1943 , but by then the artist had already gone into exile in oslo , norway , where he had started work on another merzbau in 1937 . niki 's notorious nanas the sprengel museum also houses a collection of more than 400 works from pop artist niki de saint phalle .
since the mid-1970s niki de saint phalle 's name has been intertwined with that of hanover , ever since the french artist raised the ire of many hanoverians by installing her notorious nanas along the riverside . the three brightly-colored buxom polyester statues sparked a lively debate about public art in the city .
but they survived , eventually becoming a symbol for the city on the river leine .
in 1999 , niki de saint phalle began redesigning the grotto , a 17th century structure in the famous royal herrenhausen gardens .
the completed project opened in march 2003 , a year after the artist died . fireworks and caricatures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " max and moritz " from wilhelm busch the herrenhausen gardens themselves were begun in 1666 and are made up of a french baroque garden , an english landscape garden and a botanic garden .
they are the setting for numerous summer festivals , including an international fireworks competition that features pyro-experts lighting up the skies with their craft throughout the summer months . the gardens are also the home of the german caricature museum , also called the wilhelm busch museum .
busch was a 19th century humorist and illustrator .
he penned one of germany 's most beloved children 's books about two mischievous little boys , " max und moritz . " and for a taste of gerhard schröder 's hanover , try the zoo .
the former chancellor lives in the neighborhood , and according to the zoo management , he and his wife hold a yearly pass .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .
the same rules apply to freelancers and civil servants .

only around six percent of patients are actually referred elsewhere though , since dutch gp ’ s receive excellent training and are required to regularly undergo further training .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to 10.25 percent of gross income , almost a third less than german citizens pay .
france the french public health system was rated as the best in the world by the world health organization in 2000 .
the state plays a key role in this much-lauded model .
it controls the network between the financial institutions , doctors and patients .
since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .
the same rules apply to freelancers and civil servants .
germany ranks third in global comparisons of per head health costs .
the netherlands except in emergencies , all patients in the netherlands must first visit a general practitioner -lrb- gp -rrb- of their choice when they have health problems .
only gp ’ s can decide when a patient should treated by to a specialist or a hospital .
but the patient can choose which specialist or hospital to go to .
only around six percent of patients are actually referred elsewhere though , since dutch gp ’ s receive excellent training and are required to regularly undergo further training .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to 10.25 percent of gross income , almost a third less than german citizens pay .
france the french public health system was rated as the best in the world by the world health organization in 2000 .
the state plays a key role in this much-lauded model .
it controls the network between the financial institutions , doctors and patients .
since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .
to balance it out , statutory health insurance premiums are largely shouldered by employers , while employees pay only around 0.75 percent of their salaries .
united kingdom the national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- in the united kingdom is state-backed and financed entirely by health insurance contributions .
medical services are poor in comparison to other western european countries : waiting for an appointment for an operation can take up to 18 months .
thus many patients are flown to germany or france for treatments .
older patients must sometimes do without vital services .
for example , insurance coverage no longer includes artificial hip replacements for people over 60 .
patients may take out additional private insurance policies to cover services the nhs does not provide , such as alternative treatments in an private clinics .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to at least 10 percent of gross pay .
switzerland switzerland is one of the countries with the highest concentration of doctors in the world - a total of 14,000 - and medical treatment is considered to be among the best available .
since 1996 , swiss citizens have been required to take out health insurance policies with one of 100 insurance companies .
the companies are bound to relatively liberal regulations regarding the services they offer , which are monitored by a federal authority .
in addition , citizens may choose from diverse insurance models .
premiums are tied to income levels , and patients must pay a contribution from their own pockets during each visit to the doctor . ali akinci send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers .
-lrb- july 22 , 2003 -rrb- calling all citizens to pay up following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " .
-lrb- july 24 , 2003 -rrb- germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday .

contending with heavy losses and massive job cuts , it ’ s been a rough couple of years for europe ’ s telecom giants .
but now there may be a little light at what must have seemed a very long tunnel for industry managers . europe ’ s former state-run telecommunications monopolists were once the toast of the region ’ s equity markets .
rapid growth , flashy technology and buoyant share prices all joined to make telcos such as deutsche telekom , france telecom , spain ’ s telefonica and finland ’ s sonera some of the hottest investments around .
deutsche telekom ’ s initial public offering in 1996 has even frequently been credited with single-handedly reinvigorating germany ’ s equity culture .
but those salad days are long since gone .
over the past few years europe ’ s telecom operators have stumbled their way through a minefield of slumping profits , tanking share prices and painful restructuring .
ron sommer , long deutsche telekom ’ s golden boy ceo , was forced to clean out his desk in 2002 , the same year the company posted a record loss of € 24.6 billion -lrb- $ 27.6 billion -rrb- .
though it ’ s probably of little solace to sommer , other telcos fared little better .
the 2002 earnings of france telecom , vodafone , kpn from the netherlands and telefonica were all also drenched in red .
only until very recently have industry analysts begun to see the first signs that things are starting to slowly improve for europe ’ s beleaguered giants .
many of the industry ’ s leaders have put their books back in the black by tackling their once mounting debt and putting the unrealistic expectations placed on third-generation wireless services behind them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom 's kai-uwe ricke telekom ’ s new boss kai-uwe ricke , in the saddle since november 2002 , has seen profits rebound this year , and he has continued to slash at the company ’ s near € 50-billion pile of debt .
relative rebound that ’ s all helped dt ’ s share price rebound from an all-time low of € 8.55 last autumn to € 13.50 on friday .
but it would be hard to find someone who would describe current conditions as rosy given the fact that telekom ’ s stock in spring 2000 cost nearly € 104 per share .
" every time when the price recovers a respectable amount , some more stuff rolls onto the market , " said theo kitz , an analyst for bankhaus merck , finck & co .
he said the stock will remain under pressure as major stakeholders continue to unload dt shares over the next few years .
the shares of other former monopolists have traced a similar rollercoaster path .
but equity market woes aside , europe ’ s telcos will also have to continue with their painful restructuring .
foremost on the list are massive job cuts across the industry .
spain ’ s telefonica , for example , is expected to shed 15,000 from its total 45,000 positions by the end of 2007 and deutsche telekom , which is europe ’ s largest phone company , plans to eliminate a whopping 50,000 jobs by 2005 .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .

from top art collections to a great zoo , there 's something for everyone . frequently overlooked in the past , the capital of lower saxony made the most of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to spend his 2003 summer vacation at home in hanover .
a local store owner sold hundreds of t-shirts printed with " kanzlerstadt " -lrb- chancellor 's city -rrb- .
the demand for information was so high that the tourist office had to have more brochures printed after they distributed all 15,000 of the german and english language pamphlets they had on hand . the then chancellor 's vacation plans caused many to do a retake .
visitors to the hanover world exposition in 2000 who were too busy to take in what else the city had to offer missed out on a good opportunity .
they may have thought there was n't anything more to see since few old buildings survived allied bomb raids during world war ii . grottos galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niki de saint phalle 's blue room in the herrenhausen gardens but art connoisseurs , in particular , will get their money ’ s worth when they stop here for a short break on their way to the better-visited art scenes in hamburg and berlin .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .
the same rules apply to freelancers and civil servants .
germany ranks third in global comparisons of per head health costs .
the netherlands except in emergencies , all patients in the netherlands must first visit a general practitioner -lrb- gp -rrb- of their choice when they have health problems .
only gp ’ s can decide when a patient should treated by to a specialist or a hospital .
but the patient can choose which specialist or hospital to go to .
only around six percent of patients are actually referred elsewhere though , since dutch gp ’ s receive excellent training and are required to regularly undergo further training .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to 10.25 percent of gross income , almost a third less than german citizens pay .
france the french public health system was rated as the best in the world by the world health organization in 2000 .
the state plays a key role in this much-lauded model .
it controls the network between the financial institutions , doctors and patients .
since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .
to balance it out , statutory health insurance premiums are largely shouldered by employers , while employees pay only around 0.75 percent of their salaries .
united kingdom the national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- in the united kingdom is state-backed and financed entirely by health insurance contributions .
medical services are poor in comparison to other western european countries : waiting for an appointment for an operation can take up to 18 months .
thus many patients are flown to germany or france for treatments .
older patients must sometimes do without vital services .
for example , insurance coverage no longer includes artificial hip replacements for people over 60 .
patients may take out additional private insurance policies to cover services the nhs does not provide , such as alternative treatments in an private clinics .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to at least 10 percent of gross pay .
switzerland switzerland is one of the countries with the highest concentration of doctors in the world - a total of 14,000 - and medical treatment is considered to be among the best available .
since 1996 , swiss citizens have been required to take out health insurance policies with one of 100 insurance companies .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .
the same rules apply to freelancers and civil servants .
germany ranks third in global comparisons of per head health costs .
the netherlands except in emergencies , all patients in the netherlands must first visit a general practitioner -lrb- gp -rrb- of their choice when they have health problems .
only gp ’ s can decide when a patient should treated by to a specialist or a hospital .
but the patient can choose which specialist or hospital to go to .
only around six percent of patients are actually referred elsewhere though , since dutch gp ’ s receive excellent training and are required to regularly undergo further training .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to 10.25 percent of gross income , almost a third less than german citizens pay .
france the french public health system was rated as the best in the world by the world health organization in 2000 .
the state plays a key role in this much-lauded model .
it controls the network between the financial institutions , doctors and patients .
since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .
to balance it out , statutory health insurance premiums are largely shouldered by employers , while employees pay only around 0.75 percent of their salaries .
united kingdom the national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- in the united kingdom is state-backed and financed entirely by health insurance contributions .
medical services are poor in comparison to other western european countries : waiting for an appointment for an operation can take up to 18 months .
thus many patients are flown to germany or france for treatments .
older patients must sometimes do without vital services .
for example , insurance coverage no longer includes artificial hip replacements for people over 60 .
patients may take out additional private insurance policies to cover services the nhs does not provide , such as alternative treatments in an private clinics .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to at least 10 percent of gross pay .
switzerland switzerland is one of the countries with the highest concentration of doctors in the world - a total of 14,000 - and medical treatment is considered to be among the best available .
since 1996 , swiss citizens have been required to take out health insurance policies with one of 100 insurance companies .
the companies are bound to relatively liberal regulations regarding the services they offer , which are monitored by a federal authority .
in addition , citizens may choose from diverse insurance models .
premiums are tied to income levels , and patients must pay a contribution from their own pockets during each visit to the doctor . ali akinci send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers .
-lrb- july 22 , 2003 -rrb- calling all citizens to pay up following the consensus on the healthcare reform , leading german politicians are pushing to further rescue the country 's cash-strapped social system through the introduction of " citizen 's insurance " .

the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .

from top art collections to a great zoo , there 's something for everyone . frequently overlooked in the past , the capital of lower saxony made the most of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to spend his 2003 summer vacation at home in hanover .
a local store owner sold hundreds of t-shirts printed with " kanzlerstadt " -lrb- chancellor 's city -rrb- .
the demand for information was so high that the tourist office had to have more brochures printed after they distributed all 15,000 of the german and english language pamphlets they had on hand . the then chancellor 's vacation plans caused many to do a retake .
visitors to the hanover world exposition in 2000 who were too busy to take in what else the city had to offer missed out on a good opportunity .
they may have thought there was n't anything more to see since few old buildings survived allied bomb raids during world war ii . grottos galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niki de saint phalle 's blue room in the herrenhausen gardens but art connoisseurs , in particular , will get their money ’ s worth when they stop here for a short break on their way to the better-visited art scenes in hamburg and berlin .
situated on masch lake in the midst of hanover , the sprengel museum has one of the world 's best collections of 20th century art , covering works from german expressionism to french cubism to conceptual art . it also houses a collection of work by kurt schwitters , including a reconstruction of the artist 's legendary " merzbau . "
schwitters devoted decades to his self-proclaimed life 's work and from 1923 to 1936 created a grotto-like structure in his hanover apartment .
the building was destroyed in an air raid in 1943 , but by then the artist had already gone into exile in oslo , norway , where he had started work on another merzbau in 1937 . niki 's notorious nanas the sprengel museum also houses a collection of more than 400 works from pop artist niki de saint phalle .
since the mid-1970s niki de saint phalle 's name has been intertwined with that of hanover , ever since the french artist raised the ire of many hanoverians by installing her notorious nanas along the riverside . the three brightly-colored buxom polyester statues sparked a lively debate about public art in the city .
but they survived , eventually becoming a symbol for the city on the river leine .
in 1999 , niki de saint phalle began redesigning the grotto , a 17th century structure in the famous royal herrenhausen gardens .
the completed project opened in march 2003 , a year after the artist died . fireworks and caricatures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " max and moritz " from wilhelm busch the herrenhausen gardens themselves were begun in 1666 and are made up of a french baroque garden , an english landscape garden and a botanic garden .
they are the setting for numerous summer festivals , including an international fireworks competition that features pyro-experts lighting up the skies with their craft throughout the summer months . the gardens are also the home of the german caricature museum , also called the wilhelm busch museum .
busch was a 19th century humorist and illustrator .
he penned one of germany 's most beloved children 's books about two mischievous little boys , " max und moritz . " and for a taste of gerhard schröder 's hanover , try the zoo .
the former chancellor lives in the neighborhood , and according to the zoo management , he and his wife hold a yearly pass .

since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .
to balance it out , statutory health insurance premiums are largely shouldered by employers , while employees pay only around 0.75 percent of their salaries .
united kingdom the national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- in the united kingdom is state-backed and financed entirely by health insurance contributions .
medical services are poor in comparison to other western european countries : waiting for an appointment for an operation can take up to 18 months .
thus many patients are flown to germany or france for treatments .
older patients must sometimes do without vital services .
for example , insurance coverage no longer includes artificial hip replacements for people over 60 .
patients may take out additional private insurance policies to cover services the nhs does not provide , such as alternative treatments in an private clinics .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to at least 10 percent of gross pay .
switzerland switzerland is one of the countries with the highest concentration of doctors in the world - a total of 14,000 - and medical treatment is considered to be among the best available .
since 1996 , swiss citizens have been required to take out health insurance policies with one of 100 insurance companies .
the companies are bound to relatively liberal regulations regarding the services they offer , which are monitored by a federal authority .
in addition , citizens may choose from diverse insurance models .
premiums are tied to income levels , and patients must pay a contribution from their own pockets during each visit to the doctor . ali akinci send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health care shake-up draws fire the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .
the same rules apply to freelancers and civil servants .
germany ranks third in global comparisons of per head health costs .
the netherlands except in emergencies , all patients in the netherlands must first visit a general practitioner -lrb- gp -rrb- of their choice when they have health problems .
only gp ’ s can decide when a patient should treated by to a specialist or a hospital .
but the patient can choose which specialist or hospital to go to .
only around six percent of patients are actually referred elsewhere though , since dutch gp ’ s receive excellent training and are required to regularly undergo further training .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to 10.25 percent of gross income , almost a third less than german citizens pay .
france the french public health system was rated as the best in the world by the world health organization in 2000 .
the state plays a key role in this much-lauded model .
it controls the network between the financial institutions , doctors and patients .
since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .
to balance it out , statutory health insurance premiums are largely shouldered by employers , while employees pay only around 0.75 percent of their salaries .
united kingdom the national health system -lrb- nhs -rrb- in the united kingdom is state-backed and financed entirely by health insurance contributions .
medical services are poor in comparison to other western european countries : waiting for an appointment for an operation can take up to 18 months .
thus many patients are flown to germany or france for treatments .
older patients must sometimes do without vital services .
for example , insurance coverage no longer includes artificial hip replacements for people over 60 .
patients may take out additional private insurance policies to cover services the nhs does not provide , such as alternative treatments in an private clinics .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to at least 10 percent of gross pay .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .

from top art collections to a great zoo , there 's something for everyone . frequently overlooked in the past , the capital of lower saxony made the most of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to spend his 2003 summer vacation at home in hanover .
a local store owner sold hundreds of t-shirts printed with " kanzlerstadt " -lrb- chancellor 's city -rrb- .
the demand for information was so high that the tourist office had to have more brochures printed after they distributed all 15,000 of the german and english language pamphlets they had on hand . the then chancellor 's vacation plans caused many to do a retake .
visitors to the hanover world exposition in 2000 who were too busy to take in what else the city had to offer missed out on a good opportunity .
they may have thought there was n't anything more to see since few old buildings survived allied bomb raids during world war ii . grottos galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niki de saint phalle 's blue room in the herrenhausen gardens but art connoisseurs , in particular , will get their money ’ s worth when they stop here for a short break on their way to the better-visited art scenes in hamburg and berlin .
situated on masch lake in the midst of hanover , the sprengel museum has one of the world 's best collections of 20th century art , covering works from german expressionism to french cubism to conceptual art . it also houses a collection of work by kurt schwitters , including a reconstruction of the artist 's legendary " merzbau . "
schwitters devoted decades to his self-proclaimed life 's work and from 1923 to 1936 created a grotto-like structure in his hanover apartment .
the building was destroyed in an air raid in 1943 , but by then the artist had already gone into exile in oslo , norway , where he had started work on another merzbau in 1937 . niki 's notorious nanas the sprengel museum also houses a collection of more than 400 works from pop artist niki de saint phalle .
since the mid-1970s niki de saint phalle 's name has been intertwined with that of hanover , ever since the french artist raised the ire of many hanoverians by installing her notorious nanas along the riverside . the three brightly-colored buxom polyester statues sparked a lively debate about public art in the city .
but they survived , eventually becoming a symbol for the city on the river leine .
in 1999 , niki de saint phalle began redesigning the grotto , a 17th century structure in the famous royal herrenhausen gardens .
the completed project opened in march 2003 , a year after the artist died . fireworks and caricatures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " max and moritz " from wilhelm busch the herrenhausen gardens themselves were begun in 1666 and are made up of a french baroque garden , an english landscape garden and a botanic garden .
they are the setting for numerous summer festivals , including an international fireworks competition that features pyro-experts lighting up the skies with their craft throughout the summer months . the gardens are also the home of the german caricature museum , also called the wilhelm busch museum .
busch was a 19th century humorist and illustrator .
he penned one of germany 's most beloved children 's books about two mischievous little boys , " max und moritz . " and for a taste of gerhard schröder 's hanover , try the zoo .
the former chancellor lives in the neighborhood , and according to the zoo management , he and his wife hold a yearly pass .

as germany ’ s healthcare system undergoes its most radical shake-up to date , an appraisal of public healthcare elsewhere in europe shows that the german model is one of the most expensive . german chancellor gerhard schröder reached a landmark agreement with the conservative opposition in july to revamp the country ’ s ailing healthcare system , which is plagued by skyrocketing treatment costs and premium rates .
the reforms will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public health insurance coverage for several services , such as dentures and health spa visits , in an attempt to make up for a cash shortfall of € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.4 billion -rrb- detected last year .
the government says the measures will result in savings of € 23 billion by 2004 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany ’ s public healthcare system - the most expensive after those of the united states and switzerland - since german unification in 1990 .
indeed , a look at the german model , shows it to be both complicated and costly .
health insurance is mandatory in germany .
but the sort of coverage a person receives depends on how much money she earns .
people who earn below a certain level must choose to be a member in one of numerous statutory health insurance companies , which are self-regulated and compete with each other .
yet , medical services offered by statutory health companies don ’ t vary significantly because they are bound by a legal catalogue of " mandatory services " they must provide .
health insurance premiums are split equally between employers and employees and currently average at 14.3 percent of gross wages .
citizens may freely choose doctors and clinics .
those who earn more than the set income level - currently € 3,375 - may opt for private health coverage , whose premiums and services differ .

but the patient can choose which specialist or hospital to go to .
only around six percent of patients are actually referred elsewhere though , since dutch gp ’ s receive excellent training and are required to regularly undergo further training .
statutory health insurance premiums amount to 10.25 percent of gross income , almost a third less than german citizens pay .
france the french public health system was rated as the best in the world by the world health organization in 2000 .
the state plays a key role in this much-lauded model .
it controls the network between the financial institutions , doctors and patients .
since 1996 parliament has passed a budget for the health insurance system each year .
two-thirds of french citizens are part of the statutory health insurance system .
the rest of the population participates in special models with individual premium and service regulations .
the french too , may choose their own doctors .
if they fall ill , they can decide themselves whether to go to a general practitioner or to a specialist .
but the patient has to cough up as much as 70 percent of the costs of medicines , which are sometimes very high .
to balance it out , statutory health insurance premiums are largely shouldered by employers , while employees pay only around 0.75 percent of their salaries .

from top art collections to a great zoo , there 's something for everyone . frequently overlooked in the past , the capital of lower saxony made the most of former chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to spend his 2003 summer vacation at home in hanover .
a local store owner sold hundreds of t-shirts printed with " kanzlerstadt " -lrb- chancellor 's city -rrb- .
the demand for information was so high that the tourist office had to have more brochures printed after they distributed all 15,000 of the german and english language pamphlets they had on hand . the then chancellor 's vacation plans caused many to do a retake .
visitors to the hanover world exposition in 2000 who were too busy to take in what else the city had to offer missed out on a good opportunity .
they may have thought there was n't anything more to see since few old buildings survived allied bomb raids during world war ii . grottos galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niki de saint phalle 's blue room in the herrenhausen gardens but art connoisseurs , in particular , will get their money ’ s worth when they stop here for a short break on their way to the better-visited art scenes in hamburg and berlin .
situated on masch lake in the midst of hanover , the sprengel museum has one of the world 's best collections of 20th century art , covering works from german expressionism to french cubism to conceptual art . it also houses a collection of work by kurt schwitters , including a reconstruction of the artist 's legendary " merzbau .

a lawsuit , filed almost three years ago , accuses the company of allowing troops guarding one of its pipeline projects to rape , murder and enslave villagers .
the los angeles court rejected unocal 's request to have the case removed to burma , where the alleged abuses took place , or to bermuda , where the subsidiaries allegedly involved are registered .
a lawyer for unocal - which is based in california - rejected the allegations and said that the company was considering whether to appeal immediately or to wait until after the trial , which is due to start 22 september .
' specific knowledge ' unocal is accused of being complicit in forced labour , rape and torture allegedly carried out by troops guarding the $ 1.2bn yadana pipeline during its construction in the 1990s .
according to court documents , two of the firm 's bermuda-based subsidiaries were part of the consortium that planned and built the pipeline .
unocal lawyers had argued that the case should be transferred to burma or bermuda .
" there is nothing about california involved in this case other than the parent companies that the plaintiff chose to sue being located in california .
the parent companies did not invest in the project , " daniel petrocelli , leading lawyer for the oil firm , said .
but , in documents released on thursday , los angeles judge victoria chaney said : " prior to its involvement in the pipeline project , unocal had specific knowledge that the use of forced labour was likely and nevertheless chose to proceed . "

zadie smith shot to fame with her very first novel , the bestselling white teeth .
the book won numerous awards and was made into a television series in the uk .
her follow-up book , the autograph man , was recently released in paperback .
i love london .
it 's more like i ca n't really survive without it .
i certainly could n't write without it .
and it 's much more specific - it is the area i live in from about willesden up to about hampstead heath and back .
it 's just wonderful , and quiet .
in london no matter how rich you are there is somebody very , very poor just around the corner zadie smith when the book came out there were these endless articles about " shabby willesden " .
and the terrible thing is i thought willesden was posh .
i always thought as a child that i lived in the posh part of london .
i always considered willesden to be beautiful .
so i 've always been completely bemused by these articles , and my family particularly were enormously offended .
so i never considered it that way , and it is n't that way .
i would describe white teeth as a london novel partly because i wrote it away from london and i think that when you 're away from the town you love , every feeling you have for it comes through .
i was sitting in a house in cambridge , and i find it very hard when i 'm in london to write accurately about it .
you need a bit of distance .
the physical city barely appears at all in london-based novels and particularly being in america now , i 've written a series of short stories which are kind of dripping with affection for the place .
i do n't know if i would write them if i were here .
many people set their novels in london , but the people are londoners and their pastimes are london , but the actually city , physically , barely appears at all , and that 's very common .
the person who is most grounded in london is dickens , and one of the reasons for that is he used to walk to school from camden , which is quite near me , to his grammar school , which was something like five miles away , every single day , through the whole of the city , and then back again .
and that kind of daily stepping in the town - " flaneurism " - that 's great for knowing something about a town .
the person who gets closest to it for me is somebody like forster .
howard 's end is a good example of the perfectly suburban life led by leonard bast and that kind of lower class , suburban life bumping into upper-middle-class city life .
martin amis " understood about the natural passage from one place to another " he understands how london intersects - the way you ca n't get people fenced off from each other in the way you can occasionally in new york or certainly in paris .
in london no matter how rich you are there is somebody very , very poor just around the corner .
i like martin amis very much , and white teeth owes a huge debt to london fields in every direction .
it was the first time i had read about a london since forster where he got absolutely right the random connections that are made in london .
you have this bloke , keith , who is the main character of london fields .
keith is quite low down the ladder in london , but keith , in the course of a day , will meet the very posh nicola six and her kind .
he will go all the way down the bottom to pubs where all men do is throw darts at a board day in , day out .
martin understood about the movement in london - the natural passage from one place to another .
you can very quickly go very high and very low in the same week and i think it makes london kids very streetwise and very society-wise .
the kids who went to my school , they could go to a society party and they could go to a club or they could go to a prison and they would always find their level or be able to talk to people at their level .
i do n't think there is any city to touch it in terms of its energy .
towns which are absolutely defined by their city-ness , i would put new york and london up there .
when we write about london we tend to write about it in our english way - disappointed and let down , and nothing works , and you ca n't get a bagel at three in the morning but at the same time when you 're in new york you can be uptown and you 'll be uptown for blocks and blocks and blocks of givenchy stores , and ladies with tiny dogs , and restaurants , and that 's it , for miles , and i think that 's an unnatural way to live .
new york writing is just so vibrant it 's practically musical and it adores new york , it 's in love with new york .

zadie smith shot to fame with her very first novel , the bestselling white teeth .
the book won numerous awards and was made into a television series in the uk .
her follow-up book , the autograph man , was recently released in paperback .
i love london .
it 's more like i ca n't really survive without it .
i certainly could n't write without it .
and it 's much more specific - it is the area i live in from about willesden up to about hampstead heath and back .
it 's just wonderful , and quiet .
in london no matter how rich you are there is somebody very , very poor just around the corner zadie smith when the book came out there were these endless articles about " shabby willesden " .
and the terrible thing is i thought willesden was posh .
i always thought as a child that i lived in the posh part of london .
i always considered willesden to be beautiful .
so i 've always been completely bemused by these articles , and my family particularly were enormously offended .
so i never considered it that way , and it is n't that way .
i would describe white teeth as a london novel partly because i wrote it away from london and i think that when you 're away from the town you love , every feeling you have for it comes through .
i was sitting in a house in cambridge , and i find it very hard when i 'm in london to write accurately about it .
you need a bit of distance .
the physical city barely appears at all in london-based novels and particularly being in america now , i 've written a series of short stories which are kind of dripping with affection for the place .
i do n't know if i would write them if i were here .
many people set their novels in london , but the people are londoners and their pastimes are london , but the actually city , physically , barely appears at all , and that 's very common .
the person who is most grounded in london is dickens , and one of the reasons for that is he used to walk to school from camden , which is quite near me , to his grammar school , which was something like five miles away , every single day , through the whole of the city , and then back again .
and that kind of daily stepping in the town - " flaneurism " - that 's great for knowing something about a town .
the person who gets closest to it for me is somebody like forster .
howard 's end is a good example of the perfectly suburban life led by leonard bast and that kind of lower class , suburban life bumping into upper-middle-class city life .
martin amis " understood about the natural passage from one place to another " he understands how london intersects - the way you ca n't get people fenced off from each other in the way you can occasionally in new york or certainly in paris .
in london no matter how rich you are there is somebody very , very poor just around the corner .
i like martin amis very much , and white teeth owes a huge debt to london fields in every direction .
it was the first time i had read about a london since forster where he got absolutely right the random connections that are made in london .
you have this bloke , keith , who is the main character of london fields .
keith is quite low down the ladder in london , but keith , in the course of a day , will meet the very posh nicola six and her kind .
he will go all the way down the bottom to pubs where all men do is throw darts at a board day in , day out .
martin understood about the movement in london - the natural passage from one place to another .
you can very quickly go very high and very low in the same week and i think it makes london kids very streetwise and very society-wise .
the kids who went to my school , they could go to a society party and they could go to a club or they could go to a prison and they would always find their level or be able to talk to people at their level .
i do n't think there is any city to touch it in terms of its energy .
towns which are absolutely defined by their city-ness , i would put new york and london up there .
when we write about london we tend to write about it in our english way - disappointed and let down , and nothing works , and you ca n't get a bagel at three in the morning but at the same time when you 're in new york you can be uptown and you 'll be uptown for blocks and blocks and blocks of givenchy stores , and ladies with tiny dogs , and restaurants , and that 's it , for miles , and i think that 's an unnatural way to live .
new york writing is just so vibrant it 's practically musical and it adores new york , it 's in love with new york .
and then you 've got this magazine which is devoted to the city like a lover .
every week you 've got stories about this miraculous place they live in - it 's a celebration .
but when we write about london we tend to write about it in our english way - disappointed and let down , and nothing works , and you ca n't get a bagel at three in the morning .

a m micro , the uk distributor of griffin technology which makes the itrip , said use of the device was prohibited under the wireless telegraphy act of 1949 .
the act forbids the use of radio equipment without a licence or an exemption .
the itrip transmits at very low power on an fm frequency and so in theory could interfere with broadcasts from a radio station .
pirate radio the $ 35 cylindrical device , made by griffin technology in the us , has won critical acclaim from fans of apple 's digital music player .
use of the itrip in any fm broadcasting bands is strictly prohibited a m micro statement it is plugged into the ipod and can be tuned to any fm frequency .
there are no restrictions on its use in the us , where people can use it to listen to songs stored on the ipod on a home or car stereo .
but in britain , using it is akin to setting up your own pirate radio station .
after discussions with the radio agency , a m micro concluded that using the gadget would mean breaking the law .
" in the uk fm broadcasts are allocated for the exclusive use of licensed broadcasters , " said the uk importers of the itrip in a statement .
" no other systems are permitted to operate within these bands .
the uk authorities have allocated all existing analogue fm bands .
" therefore , use of the itrip in any fm broadcasting bands is strictly prohibited . "
according to reports , two other countries - austria and iceland - have also stopped sales of the itrip because of problems with radio frequencies .

under new rules coming into force on friday , junior doctors are no longer allowed to work more than 56 hours a week , or 72 hours including time on call .
but three out of four hospitals are failing to comply , the doctors ' representative body , the bma , warned earlier this week .
and some hospitals which are apparently obeying the rules are merely fiddling figures , it said .
spokeswoman dr jo hilborne told bbc news that many were using " hastily-drawn up rotas that are not easy to work , and do not provide good training and education " .
there have been instances of doctors being put under pressure to lie so that managers can be seen to meet the target bma the rotas were being " put into place hurriedly at the last minute in an attempt to bring working hours into compliance " .
some hospitals were even asking doctors to lie about their working hours to help managers meet the target , she said .
" we do have reports of trusts putting pressure on juniors to falsify their monitoring , so they appear to be working a compliant working pattern when in fact they 're not . "
the bma said it was " examining avenues of legal redress " for doctors working outside the limits .
doctor shortage it could mean the nhs hospital trusts involved ending up in court for breach of contract .
some nhs trusts have warned the reduced working hours could result in a shortage of cover , especially in accident and emergency departments .
there are not enough doctors in the uk , notwithstanding the recent increase in figures , compared to other european countries dr jo hilborne , bma but healthcare workers say employers have known about the obligations for a long time , so there should be no excuse for them not being prepared .
the root of the problem , dr hilborne said , was in continuing staff shortages .
" there are not enough doctors in the uk , notwithstanding the recent increase in figures , compared to other european countries , " she said .
" at the end of the day , if you 're going to reduce the number of hours any particular doctor works , really the only sensible way to do that is either to increase the number of doctors ... or look at new and different ways of doing that work . "
tighter rules on way one possible solution is giving senior nurses the responsibility to take on some aspects of the doctors ' workload .
such a scheme has been successful at great ormond street children 's hospital .
the bma said it improved patient care and junior doctors ' morale .
the government says compliance with the new rules is a matter for individual trusts .
it says there has been good progress in recent years , and that 80 % of junior doctors are now working within the agreed limits .
the guidelines on working hours were first drawn up in 1991 , but have only now become contractual for all junior doctors .
there will be pressure to reduce their hours still further next year when the european working time directive comes into force .
that will limit all junior doctors to working no more than 58 hours a week from august 2004 .

under new rules coming into force on friday , junior doctors are no longer allowed to work more than 56 hours a week , or 72 hours including time on call .
but three out of four hospitals are failing to comply , the doctors ' representative body , the bma , warned earlier this week .
and some hospitals which are apparently obeying the rules are merely fiddling figures , it said .
spokeswoman dr jo hilborne told bbc news that many were using " hastily-drawn up rotas that are not easy to work , and do not provide good training and education " .
there have been instances of doctors being put under pressure to lie so that managers can be seen to meet the target bma the rotas were being " put into place hurriedly at the last minute in an attempt to bring working hours into compliance " .
some hospitals were even asking doctors to lie about their working hours to help managers meet the target , she said .
" we do have reports of trusts putting pressure on juniors to falsify their monitoring , so they appear to be working a compliant working pattern when in fact they 're not . "
the bma said it was " examining avenues of legal redress " for doctors working outside the limits .
doctor shortage it could mean the nhs hospital trusts involved ending up in court for breach of contract .
some nhs trusts have warned the reduced working hours could result in a shortage of cover , especially in accident and emergency departments .
there are not enough doctors in the uk , notwithstanding the recent increase in figures , compared to other european countries dr jo hilborne , bma but healthcare workers say employers have known about the obligations for a long time , so there should be no excuse for them not being prepared .
the root of the problem , dr hilborne said , was in continuing staff shortages .
" there are not enough doctors in the uk , notwithstanding the recent increase in figures , compared to other european countries , " she said .
" at the end of the day , if you 're going to reduce the number of hours any particular doctor works , really the only sensible way to do that is either to increase the number of doctors ... or look at new and different ways of doing that work . "
tighter rules on way one possible solution is giving senior nurses the responsibility to take on some aspects of the doctors ' workload .
such a scheme has been successful at great ormond street children 's hospital .
the bma said it improved patient care and junior doctors ' morale .
the government says compliance with the new rules is a matter for individual trusts .
it says there has been good progress in recent years , and that 80 % of junior doctors are now working within the agreed limits .
the guidelines on working hours were first drawn up in 1991 , but have only now become contractual for all junior doctors .
there will be pressure to reduce their hours still further next year when the european working time directive comes into force .
that will limit all junior doctors to working no more than 58 hours a week from august 2004 .

an attack on vale castle earlier this week is the third on an island landmark in a short period of time .
the vandalism follows similar attacks on the vale church and the millennium stone and police are investigating whether the incidents are linked .
the apparent increase in destructive behaviour is causing concern for those responsible for the island 's heritage sites .
historic sites manager for guernsey heritage , sandy hamilton , said the incident at vale castle was not as serious as it might have been .
the graffiti was sprayed on a rock just outside the castle walls , rather than on the walls themselves .
she said that , while graffiti was unusual , it was serious as , even though it could be largely removed it always left a scar .
the island 's historic sites had been inspected regularly by caretaking staff and the police had been contacted when incidents had been discovered .
but mrs hamilton said the sites had to be made available to the public , and it was simply not possible to make them vandal proof .
in the latest attack at vale castle , the message " do n't step on the momeraths " was sprayed on a boulder - possibly a reference to lewis carroll 's poem jabberwocky .
in another attack this month , at vale church , the words " this used to be god 's house - but he moved " were sprayed in black paint on the church door , one of the walls and a window .
the millennium stone at l 'ancresse was also targeted and sprayed with a graffiti message : " this is not a photo opportunity " .
