the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .

europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco . " following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .

the 7.3 percent stock gain on friday to € 22.61 -lrb- $ 25.78 -rrb- after the announcement made bayer the biggest gainer on the benchmark dax index . some analysts said the split was overdue , as the chemicals business has different cost structures and prices from bayer ’ s core businesses . core competencies the company ’ s new realignment also includes repositioning the pharmaceuticals division as a mid-size european business on a stand-alone basis within bayer healthcare ag . wenning said the decision was made because the options for partnering the pharmaceuticals division with other companies didn ’ t look profitable . “ we therefore intend to focus on our own strengths and steer our pharmaceuticals division with significantly modified structures towards a successful future , ” wenning explained , adding that the company intends to concentrate its research on areas where it already plays a leading role . wenning said bayer has already developed successful products in the therapeutic fields such as anti-infectives , cardiovascular -lrb- including treatments for diabetes and obesity -rrb- and urology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug scandal batters bayer pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .

europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco . " following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .

"
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .
but the new " lack of inhibition " is not merely limited to anti-semitism .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .
the king and the boss under one roof shakira and bruce springsteen , elvis and justin timberlake will all be under the same roof under the new deal .
bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "
the recording industry has been suffering in the face of worldwide decline in cd sales and the increasing popularity of music file-sharing web sites contributing to increased piracy .
officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .

the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .
" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .
the king and the boss under one roof shakira and bruce springsteen , elvis and justin timberlake will all be under the same roof under the new deal .
bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "
the recording industry has been suffering in the face of worldwide decline in cd sales and the increasing popularity of music file-sharing web sites contributing to increased piracy .
officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .
needs to pass anti-trust regulators once the deal is complete it will head to anti-trust regulators in washington and the european union .
the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .
" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .
thielen was optimistic that the deal would meet the approval of regulators .

"
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .
but the new " lack of inhibition " is not merely limited to anti-semitism .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .

needs to pass anti-trust regulators once the deal is complete it will head to anti-trust regulators in washington and the european union .
the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .
" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .
thielen was optimistic that the deal would meet the approval of regulators .
he said he estimated the approval process both in washington and the european union in brussels would take between six and ten months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

"
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .

there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.11.2003 taking on tobacco - a first for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about a quarter of germans light up regularly .
a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .
his lawyer also wants the court to force reemtsma to reveal information about the content of its cigarettes . heine himself is still smoking a few cigarettes a day . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma .

europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco . " following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .
bayer 's reorganization was a key requirement for this significant step . ” chemicals a weak spot industry analysts had long identified the chemicals unit as the weak link for bayer in terms of profitability . the chemicals unit had sales of € 3.3 billion last year , barely 10 percent of the company ’ s total sales of € 29.6 billion . investors appear to agree with the supervisory board ’ s assessment that the split will put newco in a more competitive position , allowing it to seek partners or investors at its discretion .
the 7.3 percent stock gain on friday to € 22.61 -lrb- $ 25.78 -rrb- after the announcement made bayer the biggest gainer on the benchmark dax index . some analysts said the split was overdue , as the chemicals business has different cost structures and prices from bayer ’ s core businesses . core competencies the company ’ s new realignment also includes repositioning the pharmaceuticals division as a mid-size european business on a stand-alone basis within bayer healthcare ag . wenning said the decision was made because the options for partnering the pharmaceuticals division with other companies didn ’ t look profitable . “ we therefore intend to focus on our own strengths and steer our pharmaceuticals division with significantly modified structures towards a successful future , ” wenning explained , adding that the company intends to concentrate its research on areas where it already plays a leading role . wenning said bayer has already developed successful products in the therapeutic fields such as anti-infectives , cardiovascular -lrb- including treatments for diabetes and obesity -rrb- and urology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug scandal batters bayer pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.11.2003 opinion : is germany experiencing a resurgence of anti-semitism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentarian recently called jews a " race of perpetrators " and a general got sacked for cheering what he allegedly described as the politician 's " courage to tell the truth . "
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .
but the new " lack of inhibition " is not merely limited to anti-semitism .
how else could a respected berlin newspaper have recently described terrorism as " part of palestinian national culture ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.11.2003 no more discriminatory insurance plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because they live longer , women pay higher insurance premiums .
the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .
" gdv hopes that the council of ministers will center their considerations more on consumer interests than the european commission did , " the insurance federation said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the directorate-general for employment and social affairs further information on the priorities and objectives on the commission 's social affairs agenda .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .
his lawyer also wants the court to force reemtsma to reveal information about the content of its cigarettes . heine himself is still smoking a few cigarettes a day . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .

europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco . " following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .
bayer 's reorganization was a key requirement for this significant step . ” chemicals a weak spot industry analysts had long identified the chemicals unit as the weak link for bayer in terms of profitability . the chemicals unit had sales of € 3.3 billion last year , barely 10 percent of the company ’ s total sales of € 29.6 billion . investors appear to agree with the supervisory board ’ s assessment that the split will put newco in a more competitive position , allowing it to seek partners or investors at its discretion .
the 7.3 percent stock gain on friday to € 22.61 -lrb- $ 25.78 -rrb- after the announcement made bayer the biggest gainer on the benchmark dax index . some analysts said the split was overdue , as the chemicals business has different cost structures and prices from bayer ’ s core businesses . core competencies the company ’ s new realignment also includes repositioning the pharmaceuticals division as a mid-size european business on a stand-alone basis within bayer healthcare ag . wenning said the decision was made because the options for partnering the pharmaceuticals division with other companies didn ’ t look profitable . “ we therefore intend to focus on our own strengths and steer our pharmaceuticals division with significantly modified structures towards a successful future , ” wenning explained , adding that the company intends to concentrate its research on areas where it already plays a leading role . wenning said bayer has already developed successful products in the therapeutic fields such as anti-infectives , cardiovascular -lrb- including treatments for diabetes and obesity -rrb- and urology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug scandal batters bayer pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.11.2003 opinion : is germany experiencing a resurgence of anti-semitism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentarian recently called jews a " race of perpetrators " and a general got sacked for cheering what he allegedly described as the politician 's " courage to tell the truth . "
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .
but the new " lack of inhibition " is not merely limited to anti-semitism .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .
his lawyer also wants the court to force reemtsma to reveal information about the content of its cigarettes . heine himself is still smoking a few cigarettes a day . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .
the king and the boss under one roof shakira and bruce springsteen , elvis and justin timberlake will all be under the same roof under the new deal .
bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "
the recording industry has been suffering in the face of worldwide decline in cd sales and the increasing popularity of music file-sharing web sites contributing to increased piracy .
officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .
needs to pass anti-trust regulators once the deal is complete it will head to anti-trust regulators in washington and the european union .
the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .
" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .
thielen was optimistic that the deal would meet the approval of regulators .
he said he estimated the approval process both in washington and the european union in brussels would take between six and ten months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .
his lawyer also wants the court to force reemtsma to reveal information about the content of its cigarettes . heine himself is still smoking a few cigarettes a day . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma .

"
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .
the king and the boss under one roof shakira and bruce springsteen , elvis and justin timberlake will all be under the same roof under the new deal .
bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "
the recording industry has been suffering in the face of worldwide decline in cd sales and the increasing popularity of music file-sharing web sites contributing to increased piracy .
officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .
needs to pass anti-trust regulators once the deal is complete it will head to anti-trust regulators in washington and the european union .
the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .
" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .
thielen was optimistic that the deal would meet the approval of regulators .
he said he estimated the approval process both in washington and the european union in brussels would take between six and ten months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco . " following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .
bayer 's reorganization was a key requirement for this significant step . ” chemicals a weak spot industry analysts had long identified the chemicals unit as the weak link for bayer in terms of profitability . the chemicals unit had sales of € 3.3 billion last year , barely 10 percent of the company ’ s total sales of € 29.6 billion . investors appear to agree with the supervisory board ’ s assessment that the split will put newco in a more competitive position , allowing it to seek partners or investors at its discretion .
the 7.3 percent stock gain on friday to € 22.61 -lrb- $ 25.78 -rrb- after the announcement made bayer the biggest gainer on the benchmark dax index . some analysts said the split was overdue , as the chemicals business has different cost structures and prices from bayer ’ s core businesses . core competencies the company ’ s new realignment also includes repositioning the pharmaceuticals division as a mid-size european business on a stand-alone basis within bayer healthcare ag . wenning said the decision was made because the options for partnering the pharmaceuticals division with other companies didn ’ t look profitable . “ we therefore intend to focus on our own strengths and steer our pharmaceuticals division with significantly modified structures towards a successful future , ” wenning explained , adding that the company intends to concentrate its research on areas where it already plays a leading role . wenning said bayer has already developed successful products in the therapeutic fields such as anti-infectives , cardiovascular -lrb- including treatments for diabetes and obesity -rrb- and urology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug scandal batters bayer pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .

there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .
his lawyer also wants the court to force reemtsma to reveal information about the content of its cigarettes . heine himself is still smoking a few cigarettes a day . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .

" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "

" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .

is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .
but the new " lack of inhibition " is not merely limited to anti-semitism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.11.2003 opinion : is germany experiencing a resurgence of anti-semitism ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentarian recently called jews a " race of perpetrators " and a general got sacked for cheering what he allegedly described as the politician 's " courage to tell the truth . "
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .
but the new " lack of inhibition " is not merely limited to anti-semitism .

europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .

according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .

" following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .
bayer 's reorganization was a key requirement for this significant step . ” chemicals a weak spot industry analysts had long identified the chemicals unit as the weak link for bayer in terms of profitability . the chemicals unit had sales of € 3.3 billion last year , barely 10 percent of the company ’ s total sales of € 29.6 billion . investors appear to agree with the supervisory board ’ s assessment that the split will put newco in a more competitive position , allowing it to seek partners or investors at its discretion .
the 7.3 percent stock gain on friday to € 22.61 -lrb- $ 25.78 -rrb- after the announcement made bayer the biggest gainer on the benchmark dax index . some analysts said the split was overdue , as the chemicals business has different cost structures and prices from bayer ’ s core businesses . core competencies the company ’ s new realignment also includes repositioning the pharmaceuticals division as a mid-size european business on a stand-alone basis within bayer healthcare ag . wenning said the decision was made because the options for partnering the pharmaceuticals division with other companies didn ’ t look profitable . “ we therefore intend to focus on our own strengths and steer our pharmaceuticals division with significantly modified structures towards a successful future , ” wenning explained , adding that the company intends to concentrate its research on areas where it already plays a leading role . wenning said bayer has already developed successful products in the therapeutic fields such as anti-infectives , cardiovascular -lrb- including treatments for diabetes and obesity -rrb- and urology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug scandal batters bayer pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .

europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco . " following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .
bayer 's reorganization was a key requirement for this significant step . ” chemicals a weak spot industry analysts had long identified the chemicals unit as the weak link for bayer in terms of profitability . the chemicals unit had sales of € 3.3 billion last year , barely 10 percent of the company ’ s total sales of € 29.6 billion . investors appear to agree with the supervisory board ’ s assessment that the split will put newco in a more competitive position , allowing it to seek partners or investors at its discretion .
the 7.3 percent stock gain on friday to € 22.61 -lrb- $ 25.78 -rrb- after the announcement made bayer the biggest gainer on the benchmark dax index . some analysts said the split was overdue , as the chemicals business has different cost structures and prices from bayer ’ s core businesses . core competencies the company ’ s new realignment also includes repositioning the pharmaceuticals division as a mid-size european business on a stand-alone basis within bayer healthcare ag . wenning said the decision was made because the options for partnering the pharmaceuticals division with other companies didn ’ t look profitable . “ we therefore intend to focus on our own strengths and steer our pharmaceuticals division with significantly modified structures towards a successful future , ” wenning explained , adding that the company intends to concentrate its research on areas where it already plays a leading role . wenning said bayer has already developed successful products in the therapeutic fields such as anti-infectives , cardiovascular -lrb- including treatments for diabetes and obesity -rrb- and urology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug scandal batters bayer pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .
his lawyer also wants the court to force reemtsma to reveal information about the content of its cigarettes . heine himself is still smoking a few cigarettes a day . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .
the king and the boss under one roof shakira and bruce springsteen , elvis and justin timberlake will all be under the same roof under the new deal .
bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "
the recording industry has been suffering in the face of worldwide decline in cd sales and the increasing popularity of music file-sharing web sites contributing to increased piracy .
officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .
needs to pass anti-trust regulators once the deal is complete it will head to anti-trust regulators in washington and the european union .
the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .
" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .
thielen was optimistic that the deal would meet the approval of regulators .
he said he estimated the approval process both in washington and the european union in brussels would take between six and ten months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .
the king and the boss under one roof shakira and bruce springsteen , elvis and justin timberlake will all be under the same roof under the new deal .
bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "
the recording industry has been suffering in the face of worldwide decline in cd sales and the increasing popularity of music file-sharing web sites contributing to increased piracy .
officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .
needs to pass anti-trust regulators once the deal is complete it will head to anti-trust regulators in washington and the european union .
the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .
" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .
thielen was optimistic that the deal would meet the approval of regulators .
he said he estimated the approval process both in washington and the european union in brussels would take between six and ten months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .

there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .

heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.11.2003 bayer cuts chemicals unit loose großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer ag has been struggling over the past three years after problems with key drugs .
europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco . " following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .
bayer 's reorganization was a key requirement for this significant step . ” chemicals a weak spot industry analysts had long identified the chemicals unit as the weak link for bayer in terms of profitability . the chemicals unit had sales of € 3.3 billion last year , barely 10 percent of the company ’ s total sales of € 29.6 billion . investors appear to agree with the supervisory board ’ s assessment that the split will put newco in a more competitive position , allowing it to seek partners or investors at its discretion .
the 7.3 percent stock gain on friday to € 22.61 -lrb- $ 25.78 -rrb- after the announcement made bayer the biggest gainer on the benchmark dax index . some analysts said the split was overdue , as the chemicals business has different cost structures and prices from bayer ’ s core businesses . core competencies the company ’ s new realignment also includes repositioning the pharmaceuticals division as a mid-size european business on a stand-alone basis within bayer healthcare ag . wenning said the decision was made because the options for partnering the pharmaceuticals division with other companies didn ’ t look profitable . “ we therefore intend to focus on our own strengths and steer our pharmaceuticals division with significantly modified structures towards a successful future , ” wenning explained , adding that the company intends to concentrate its research on areas where it already plays a leading role . wenning said bayer has already developed successful products in the therapeutic fields such as anti-infectives , cardiovascular -lrb- including treatments for diabetes and obesity -rrb- and urology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug scandal batters bayer pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .

is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say .

it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .
" gdv hopes that the council of ministers will center their considerations more on consumer interests than the european commission did , " the insurance federation said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the directorate-general for employment and social affairs further information on the priorities and objectives on the commission 's social affairs agenda .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .
the king and the boss under one roof shakira and bruce springsteen , elvis and justin timberlake will all be under the same roof under the new deal .
bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "
the recording industry has been suffering in the face of worldwide decline in cd sales and the increasing popularity of music file-sharing web sites contributing to increased piracy .
officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .

the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .
" while we realize that the music industry currently faces numerous problems , greater consolidation may not be the answer to those problems , " u.s. senators mike dewine and herb kohl , the chairman and ranking democrat on the senate 's anti-trust subcommitte , said in a statement .
regulators already denied a bertelsmann bid to merge with emi in 2001 .
the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .

europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco .

but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .

the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .

the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .
thielen was optimistic that the deal would meet the approval of regulators .
he said he estimated the approval process both in washington and the european union in brussels would take between six and ten months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .

"
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.11.2003 no more discriminatory insurance plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because they live longer , women pay higher insurance premiums .
the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .
" gdv hopes that the council of ministers will center their considerations more on consumer interests than the european commission did , " the insurance federation said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the directorate-general for employment and social affairs further information on the priorities and objectives on the commission 's social affairs agenda .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .
" gdv hopes that the council of ministers will center their considerations more on consumer interests than the european commission did , " the insurance federation said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the directorate-general for employment and social affairs further information on the priorities and objectives on the commission 's social affairs agenda .

a german smoker is suing a tobacco company , claiming that his cigarette addiction caused severe health problems .
court hearings began on friday .
the judge will decide on nov .
14 whether to admit the unprecedented case . wolfgang heine lit his first cigarette almost 40 years ago .
the 56-year-old from a small town near dortmund in western germany has been smoking ever since - two packs a day until 1983 , a little less than that since then . ten years ago , he had a heart attack , followed by another one in 1999 .
he 's already undergone two bypass surgeries and needs a third , but his doctors do n't think that his heart could handle any more . wolfgang heine says he is dying .
" i 'm short of breath , quickly get exhausted and have to rest a lot , " he told dpa .
he blames the reemtsma tobacco company , whose cigarettes he 's been smoking all along . on friday , heine took his case to a german courtroom .
he 's breaking new ground in the country , because for the first time , a tobacco company will have to defend itself against charges of endangering peoples ' health through smoking . after oral arguments from both sides , a district court judge in the western german town of arnsberg made no decision whether to let the case proceed to trial .
he is expected to do so on nov .
14 . lawyers for heine and reemtsma said they were confident to prevail in the matter .
heine 's lawyer said he expected the judge to follow his request to begin hearing evidence in the dispute .
a reemtsma spokesperson countered that the company believed the plaintiff 's arguments to be too weak . trials common in u.s. while the future of heine 's lawsuit remains uncertain , such trials are common in the united states .
there , juries have awarded billions of dollars in punitive damages to sick smokers .
but in germany , the federal court of justice has thrown out similar lawsuits in the past , ruling that smokers should know about the risks involved with their habit . the last time a smoker pressed for damages against a tobacco company was in may 2000 , but it was quickly shot down by the court as unfounded .
germany 's smoker levels are among the highest in the world .
about 18 to 20 million germans , roughly a quarter of the population , smoke a pack of cigarettes a day .
the country also tops the list of nations with the highest number of young smokers , according to the german center for questions regarding addiction : more than ten percent of 13 to 15-year-olds smoke , as do more than 15 percent of germans under 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large warning lables like " smoking gives you wrinkles " and " giving up smoking will reduce your risk of heart and lung disease " are designed to get people to kick the habit .
heine , a retired accountant , claims that warnings on cigarette packs , which have recently been enlarged , did n't exist when he started smoking .
he 's also arguing that tobacco companies add addictive substances to their cigarettes .
the company , which kept a low profile prior to friday 's hearing , denies this . the german reemtsma is now owned by the british imperial tobacco group .
it is the world 's fourth largest cigarette company and produces the brands davidoff , west , r1 and peter stuyvesant .
so far the company has managed to keep itself out of the expensive litigation processes its competitors face . setting off an avalanche of law suits ? should heine be successful in court , other smokers are expected to follow suit . " then it 's a whole different ballgame , involving billions of euros , " heine 's lawyer told dpa .
he added that to his knowledge , tobacco companies have insured themselves against smokers ' claims in the billions . unlike american smokers who press for millions , heine is only asking for a total of € 213,000 -lrb- $ 244,000 -rrb- .

" if you were to deprive americans of american football for a year and a half , they 'd also become pretty aggressive and nervous . "
he complained that he is not getting any support from the americans , who in his opinion have let the baghdad soccer stadium deteriorate to the point of resembling a " trash can . "
he says he has funded his team from his own pocket and has not been paid since january .
stange , who started working in iraq a year ago while saddam hussein was still in power , said he is considering leaving .

the european union wants to ensure equal treatment of men and women for all goods and services , including insurance .
but industry experts are up in arms , saying higher premiums are based on risk , not gender . women often face higher premiums for pension insurance .
men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna diamantopoulou when these factors are removed from the equation , differences in life expectancy on purely gender grounds are much less than stated .
equally , in some member states , a distinction between the sexes is made in motor insurance , with men paying higher premiums .
here again a number of factors other than sex play a role .
" it is therefore the view of the commission that calculating risk based on the grounds of sex is discrimination , " the body said .
this is not true , says the german insurance federation gesamtverband der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft -lrb- gdv -rrb- .
" it is not discrimination , but rather a factually-based differentiation when different gender-specific insurance products have different prices , " a gdv spokesman told dw-world .
the concept behind insurers ' calculations is simple : lower risks pay lower premiums .
the spokesman said the commission 's assumption that a woman smoker poses the same risk as a non-smoking male is incorrect .
" a woman would have to smoke 60 cigarettes a day to shorten her life to live as long as an average man who does n't smoke , " he said .
" the sex still plays a role in life expectancy . "
diamantopoulou is not phased by the criticism .
" as with past breakthroughs in the field of gender equality , it is being greeted with pessimism from some parts of industry , " she said .
no cheap haircuts for women although the proposal aims to prohibit discrimination in all available goods and services , it does have some form of flexibility .
the commission has allowed for " justified exceptions . "
these involve a good or service intended exclusively or primarily for members of one sex , such as single-sex sessions in a swimming pool , or single-sex private member 's clubs .
in addition , it allows for differences when the skills required for its delivery were different for each sex , for example in hairdressing .
the commission has suggested a transitional period of six years for the insurance sector to equalize its premiums .
the proposal will now be forwarded to the eu 's council of ministers for adoption , after consultation of the european parliament .

men pay more for their life insurance policies .
this is justified by the industry on the grounds that women live longer .
but this could all change soon , if the european commission directive to outlaw these common practices is successful .
according to social affairs commissioner anna diamantopoulou , insurance payments should be based on factors such as health risks and life expectancy - not on gender .
the commission has now presented a proposal for a council directive on the equal treatment of men and women in the access to goods and services .
the proposed directive would explicitly tackle the issues of premiums and benefits in the insurance sector .
so , for example , the use of sex as a factor in the calculation of premiums and benefits for insurance and related financial services would be prohibited .
" this is a ground breaking proposal , calling for gender solidarity in european society , " diamantopoulou said in a statement .
not sex , but risk according to diamantopoulou -lrb- photo -rrb- , there are a number of factors that are not linked to sex that are equally important in establishing life expectancy , such as socio-economic or marital status , the region a person lives in or levels of smoking .

according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.11.2003 bayer cuts chemicals unit loose großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer ag has been struggling over the past three years after problems with key drugs .
europe ’ s stock markets responded positively to reports that bayer has decided to sell its chemicals business and part of its polymers business . shares in bayer ag surged seven percent on friday after several german newspapers reported plans by the struggling chemical and pharmaceutical giant to offload its chemicals unit , breaking up its traditional four-pillar strategy encompassing healthcare , polymers , chemicals and agrochemicals .
end of an era the news came after bayer ’ s supervisory board met to discuss a restructuring of the company .
according to the german news weekly der spiegel , it ’ s the end of an era . the supervisory board decided to spin off its chemicals unit and parts of the polymers business to form a new company with sales of approximately € 5.6 billion and a workforce of about 20,000 employees .
bayer plans to list the company on the stock market under a new name by early 2005 at the latest . bayer ’ s ceo werner wenning said the split would benefit both bayer as well as the new chemicals company , provisionally called newco . " following the separation , bayer – with sales of around € 22 billion – will be able to focus more closely on the core businesses in which we have excellent technologies , strong market positions and above all growth areas that we intend to further strengthen by pooling all our resources , ” wenning said . “ in this way , we aim to safeguard the success of our company in the long term and generate additional value .
bayer 's reorganization was a key requirement for this significant step . ” chemicals a weak spot industry analysts had long identified the chemicals unit as the weak link for bayer in terms of profitability . the chemicals unit had sales of € 3.3 billion last year , barely 10 percent of the company ’ s total sales of € 29.6 billion . investors appear to agree with the supervisory board ’ s assessment that the split will put newco in a more competitive position , allowing it to seek partners or investors at its discretion .
the 7.3 percent stock gain on friday to € 22.61 -lrb- $ 25.78 -rrb- after the announcement made bayer the biggest gainer on the benchmark dax index . some analysts said the split was overdue , as the chemicals business has different cost structures and prices from bayer ’ s core businesses . core competencies the company ’ s new realignment also includes repositioning the pharmaceuticals division as a mid-size european business on a stand-alone basis within bayer healthcare ag . wenning said the decision was made because the options for partnering the pharmaceuticals division with other companies didn ’ t look profitable . “ we therefore intend to focus on our own strengths and steer our pharmaceuticals division with significantly modified structures towards a successful future , ” wenning explained , adding that the company intends to concentrate its research on areas where it already plays a leading role . wenning said bayer has already developed successful products in the therapeutic fields such as anti-infectives , cardiovascular -lrb- including treatments for diabetes and obesity -rrb- and urology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug scandal batters bayer pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .

bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "

officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .

the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .

the emi group met a similar fate after trying to merge with warner music the first time around in 2000 .

bertelsmann music group and sony music are headed for a mega-merger that would put the two just behind market leader universal music .
but anti-trust regulators will have the last word . german media giant bertelsmann 's music division could be heading for a mega-merger with sony music that would cut costs and anchor the fused companies in an industry on the rocks .
executives from the two companies signed a letter of intent for the 50-50 merger on thursday , according to reports .
the deal would merge the worldwide no. 2 music company , sony , with the no. 5 , bertelsmann 's bmg .
every fourth cd will come from the fused company and their combined market share of just over 24 percent will be merely a few percentage points behind market leader universal .
" the planned company ... will offer artists from around the world an attractive home , " bertelsmann ceo gunter thielen and bmg 's rolf-schmidt-holtz said in a joint statement .
the king and the boss under one roof shakira and bruce springsteen , elvis and justin timberlake will all be under the same roof under the new deal .
bmg and sony executives said the move will keep them from having to cut artists .
" if -lrb- sony and bmg -rrb- stood alone , we would have to cut artist rosters and even close activities in smaller countries , " said schmidt-holtz .
" this merger is the best gurantee that we can maintain a broad roster of artists in the current environment . "
the recording industry has been suffering in the face of worldwide decline in cd sales and the increasing popularity of music file-sharing web sites contributing to increased piracy .
officials from both record labels said the deal will provide stability in uncertain times .
needs to pass anti-trust regulators once the deal is complete it will head to anti-trust regulators in washington and the european union .
the merger announcement comes as rumors fly that british label emi and warner music are close to completing a deal of their own .
the merger would reduce further the number of big labels from five to three , something that experts say regulators would most likely not approve .

"
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .

"
is hate speech on the rise in germany ? with the exception of former french president charles de gaulle 's comment in 1967 that jews were “ self-assured and domineering , ” western european politicians have in the past 50 years rarely made openly anti-semitic statements - especially not in germany . when it has happened , it has usually come from the fringes of the political spectrum or from parliamentary backbenchers trying to distinguish themselves in a dubious fashion .
there seemed to be a consensus that " you do n't say things like that , " since a consensus also reigned that the jews had been subjected to unending injustice . older than the nazis it 's futile to ponder whether society 's exploration of the holocaust has indeed spurred a major rethinking , or whether some of what is now being said and done did n't actually spring from political correctness rather than real conviction . without coming to anyone 's defense or laying into anyone else : anti-semitism is older than the nazis ' racial fanaticism .
its roots lay partly in the church , and it would have taken a miracle if such deeply rooted - conscious and unconscious - feelings , which developed over a thousand years , would have been eliminated within merely a few years or even decades . if they had been eliminated we would n't be forced to deal with people in regular and apparently ever shorter intervals saying what one " ought to be allowed to say . "
it 's a clever argument that appeals to simple minds who have always had the feeling " dark forces " prevent them from calling a spade a spade . it 's wrong that the germans have for decades sported muzzles whose removal some people may now celebrate as a step toward national self-realization .
what is said in the name of this alleged " new freedom " is just as wrong . in the first place , anti-semitic - or to generalize , racist - statements are intended to blame a minority for whatever plagues the accuser .
it is certainly not a phenomenon exclusive to the germans , but one that is just as human as it is inhuman . spreading half-truths it 's a phenomenon that lives from the spread of half-truths , like the nazis ' claims there were " jewish bolshevists " on the one side , but on the other - in the united states - they spoke of " jewish high finance . " since the 19th century , jews in russia have repeatedly been among the groups persecuted - under every regime .
but this fact is kept quiet , just as is the fact that there have always been openly anti-semitic groups and theories in the united states and that the large majority of american jews are by no means millionaires . but such facts are unwelcome because they destroy the anti-semitic , racially motivated line of reasoning that some people use to elevate themselves beyond their own triviality . at best , laws can help to change this , but they wo n't bring about real change .
the german federal republic 's history has shown that .
despite intensive efforts , again and again , lapses - which are actually no such thing - occur .
and they only expose what 's there anyway . but that 's not just the case in germany . a rather dubious european union poll has shown that a " majority " of europeans describe israel as a " threat to world peace . " the fact is that many people do n't differentiate between israel and the jews .
but the new " lack of inhibition " is not merely limited to anti-semitism .

but for now it will remain the task of the ruling party to try and reform the economy - a task it has been struggling with for more than a decade .
for the first time in a decade - and only the second in half a century - the ruling liberal democratic party is facing something close to a serious challenge to its hegemony in the general election which takes place on sunday 9 november .
that could mean serious political argument about how to go about fixing japan 's economy , battered by repeated recession , stubborn deflation , and the long hangover from the collapse of its asset bubble at the start of the 1990s .
several captains of industry have said they would like to see the ldp and its charismatic prime minister , junichiro koizumi , forced to deal with a serious challenge from the left-democratic party of japan -lrb- dpj -rrb- among them are the heads of technology group kyocera and scientific instrument firm horiba , and management guru kenichi ohmae .
the three were among business leaders who co-signed an advert in the country 's biggest newspapers warning that 50 years of cohabitation between the ldp , bureaucrats and business made it " impossible for normal politics to proceed " .
" as a result there is a sense of stalemate in japan , " they said .
beauty contest but the big change may have to wait a while .
the key issues pensions : how will the government cope with an ageing population ?
the economy : jobs are hard to come by and the recovery is fragile at best , while public debt is still high public sector reform : unwieldy postal savings and highways agencies are still waiting to be sold off crime : recent high-profile cases involving children , foreigners and yakuza gangsters are highlighting the issue despite low crime rates by international standards defence : mr koizumi wants to repeal the pacifist sections of the constitution - and send troops to iraq the dpj and its leader , naoto kan , are doing everything they can to present themselves as a genuine alternative government - not something opposition parties have really done in the past - including the unprecedented move of publishing a detailed manifesto .
even so , few forecasters think they can knock the ldp off its perch quite yet , although many believe the ldp-led ruling coalition could lose seats .
the economy , by far the biggest issue for most voters , is finally showing signs of revival , with growth estimated at 1.2 % for this year - painfully slow by some standards but a turnaround from years of stagnation .
under pressure from mr koizumi 's hard-line economics minister , heizo takenaka , the banks are at last cleaning up their stacks of bad debts , a factor which has been crippling investment for years .
the nikkei 225 index of leading shares is up more than 30 % this year .
and in what is developing into a beauty contest between the two party leaders - both relatively young by japanese standards - mr koizumi certainly seems to have the edge .
trouble in store ?
not that japan is out of the woods , as mr kan is at pains to point out .
the number of people in work is continuing to fall , down more than 600,000 over the two years since mr koizumi replaced his lacklustre predecessor yoshiro mori , and unemployment is now at 5.1 % .
deflation , or falling prices , is still dogging japan , making people cautious about spending and hampering domestic companies ' performance .
and despite having swept to power on reform credentials , critics charge - with some justification - that not much has actually been done .
aside from the acceleration of the banking cleanup , the promised privatisation of state enterprises such as the mammoth postal savings system - with 1.2 trillion yen -lrb- $ 100bn -rrb- on its books - and the heavily loss-making highways agency have got nowhere .
despite some action , the country 's huge debts , ballooned by a series of pork-barrel public works projects in the 1990s , remain close to 140 % of national output .
and the pensions system remains broadly unreformed , despite widespread worries that the rapid ageing of the population means prompt and radical action is needed to fix it .
the dpj hopes these factors , and its own specific proposals to use consumption taxes to patch pensions and abolish the highways agency , will help give it the balance of power in the elections .
it is also betting on a strong turnout as some newspaper polls predict , which traditionally acts against the ldp .
out with the old ...
but given that the dpj is unlikely to win the election outright , the irony is that a big victory by mr koizumi may strengthen his hand in carrying out reforms once the election is over .
one reason the postal savings and highways agency have been so difficult to tackle is the power of the ldp 's old guard , who have used the two as cash-cows to help friends in business and provide jobs when they retire .
but several big names have been kicked off the party 's lists for this election - and in an absolutely unprecedented move , the head of the highways agency was unceremoniously sacked .
that , coupled with the rapid promotion of younger mps to key positions , might make more room to push reform forward .
and the fact that the last election in 2000 was held when the ldp was in a trough under yoshiro mori could make it easier to show an improved position this time around .
overall , a strong showing would make it easier for mr koizumi to resist the anti-reform agenda in his factionalised party .

the key issues pensions : how will the government cope with an ageing population ?
the economy : jobs are hard to come by and the recovery is fragile at best , while public debt is still high public sector reform : unwieldy postal savings and highways agencies are still waiting to be sold off crime : recent high-profile cases involving children , foreigners and yakuza gangsters are highlighting the issue despite low crime rates by international standards defence : mr koizumi wants to repeal the pacifist sections of the constitution - and send troops to iraq the dpj and its leader , naoto kan , are doing everything they can to present themselves as a genuine alternative government - not something opposition parties have really done in the past - including the unprecedented move of publishing a detailed manifesto .
even so , few forecasters think they can knock the ldp off its perch quite yet , although many believe the ldp-led ruling coalition could lose seats .
the economy , by far the biggest issue for most voters , is finally showing signs of revival , with growth estimated at 1.2 % for this year - painfully slow by some standards but a turnaround from years of stagnation .
under pressure from mr koizumi 's hard-line economics minister , heizo takenaka , the banks are at last cleaning up their stacks of bad debts , a factor which has been crippling investment for years .
the nikkei 225 index of leading shares is up more than 30 % this year .
opposition leader naoto kan insists it is time for a change and in what is developing into a beauty contest between the two party leaders - both relatively young by japanese standards - mr koizumi certainly seems to have the edge .
trouble in store ?
not that japan is out of the woods , as mr kan is at pains to point out .
the number of people in work is continuing to fall , down more than 600,000 over the two years since mr koizumi replaced his lacklustre predecessor yoshiro mori , and unemployment is now at 5.1 % .
deflation , or falling prices , is still dogging japan , making people cautious about spending and hampering domestic companies ' performance .
and despite having swept to power on reform credentials , critics charge - with some justification - that not much has actually been done .
aside from the acceleration of the banking cleanup , the promised privatisation of state enterprises such as the mammoth postal savings system - with 1.2 trillion yen -lrb- $ 100bn -rrb- on its books - and the heavily loss-making highways agency have got nowhere .
despite some action , the country 's huge debts , ballooned by a series of pork-barrel public works projects in the 1990s , remain close to 140 % of national output .
and the pensions system remains broadly unreformed , despite widespread worries that the rapid ageing of the population means prompt and radical action is needed to fix it .
japan 's economy is undergoing a fragile recovery the dpj hopes these factors , and its own specific proposals to use consumption taxes to patch pensions and abolish the highways agency , will help give it the balance of power in the elections .
it is also betting on a strong turnout as some newspaper polls predict , which traditionally acts against the ldp .
out with the old ...
but given that the dpj is unlikely to win the election outright , the irony is that a big victory by mr koizumi may strengthen his hand in carrying out reforms once the election is over .
one reason the postal savings and highways agency have been so difficult to tackle is the power of the ldp 's old guard , who have used the two as cash-cows to help friends in business and provide jobs when they retire .
but several big names have been kicked off the party 's lists for this election - and in an absolutely unprecedented move , the head of the highways agency was unceremoniously sacked .
that , coupled with the rapid promotion of younger mps to key positions , might make more room to push reform forward .
and the fact that the last election in 2000 was held when the ldp was in a trough under yoshiro mori could make it easier to show an improved position this time around .
overall , a strong showing would make it easier for mr koizumi to resist the anti-reform agenda in his factionalised party .

but for now it will remain the task of the ruling party to try and reform the economy - a task it has been struggling with for more than a decade .
for the first time in a decade - and only the second in half a century - the ruling liberal democratic party is facing something close to a serious challenge to its hegemony in the general election which takes place on sunday 9 november .
that could mean serious political argument about how to go about fixing japan 's economy , battered by repeated recession , stubborn deflation , and the long hangover from the collapse of its asset bubble at the start of the 1990s .
several captains of industry have said they would like to see the ldp and its charismatic prime minister , junichiro koizumi , forced to deal with a serious challenge from the left-democratic party of japan -lrb- dpj -rrb- among them are the heads of technology group kyocera and scientific instrument firm horiba , and management guru kenichi ohmae .
the three were among business leaders who co-signed an advert in the country 's biggest newspapers warning that 50 years of cohabitation between the ldp , bureaucrats and business made it " impossible for normal politics to proceed " .
" as a result there is a sense of stalemate in japan , " they said .

even with all staff now back at work , such is the backlog of mail that hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses across the uk may still have to wait up to a fortnight for that important letter or parcel to finally arrive .
whatever the rights or wrongs behind the unofficial walkouts , the public can be forgiven for being completely exasperated with the royal mail .
but maybe not as frustrated as the company itself .
what we actually sell is trust , and we are going to be in trouble if we do n't have trust billy hayes , general secretary , cwu because the industrial action was unofficial , whatever agreements the royal mail can broker with the communication workers ' union -lrb- cwu -rrb- , there is no guarantee the workers will not choose to down tools - or rather , letters - again in the near future .
and all at a time when the royal mail continues to haemorrhage cash - its most recent annual loss , reported back in the spring , was £ 611m .
modernisation losing so much money , it is understandable that the company , led by chairman allan leighton , is determined to move ahead with its three-year modernisation plans , centred around reducing its 200,000 strong workforce by 30,000 , and introducing more efficient working practices .

however , the company 's need to turn its finances around is made more pressing by the one word guaranteed to put the fear of god into any monopoly business - ' deregulation ' .

seismic the seismic change will come in four year 's time , when the entire postal industry will be completely deregulated .

to prosper in this competitive market place , the royal mail will need to be as lean as possible .
andy frewin , external relations director at postwatch , the postal industry 's consumer watchdog , believes the royal mail will be able to meet the challenge .
the royal mail is definitely still overstaffed and needs to be much meaner and leaner andy frewin , postwatch " it is firstly important to differentiate between letters and parcels .
to deliver anything above 350g you do n't need a licence , so more than 4,000 companies currently deliver parcels and it is very , very competitive , " he said .
" when it comes to letters , the royal mail still has 99.7 % of the marketplace , according to official postcomm figures .
" it is obviously very hard to lose money if you are in such a monopoly position , and the royal mail is definitely still overstaffed and needs to be much meaner and leaner .
but we do not believe this will mean compulsory redundancies because it has such a high level of staff turnover or churn . "
fresh air mr frewin added that allan leighton - who has already halved losses - was " a breath of fresh air " .
he continued : " deregulation and the resulting choice is always good news for customers , and i believe that the royal mail can still be very successful .
despite all the talk of emails , more letters are still being posted than ever before .
" they said in the past that the telegram was going to kill off letters , and then it was the telephone , and it is the same situation now - every year more letters are being delivered . "
a spokesman for postcomm , the regulatory body of the postal industry , said that in order for the deregulated market to work , it needed a strong and successful royal mail .
billy hayes , general secretary of the cwu , said : " obviously the last week was n't helpful to state the obvious , and people will think of alternative ways .
" at the same time , in things like industrial action , there are two culpable parties .
obviously we now need to work together and make sure we offer a reliable service .
" what we actually sell is trust , and we are going to be in trouble if we do n't have trust , " argued mr hayes .

members of the campaign to protect rural england claim that light pollution in the region is now 30 % greater than ten years ago .
and views of the milky way , northern lights and shooting stars are all but invisible to the naked eye because of the amount of ambient light .
satellite images of the area show whole swathes covered in an orange-yellow glow which signifies intense light output from man-made structures .
ian mckechnie , the senior environmental health officer at the east riding of yorkshire council , says the light pollution has now got out of control .
" light pollution is now 28-30 % worse than it was ten years ago and most alarmingly half of the areas in east yorkshire that had dark skies ten years ago are now polluted with light .
" we 'd like more legal powers to control light pollution . "
ian mckechnie says the pollution has increase 30 % in 10 years he said one of the main sources of light in rural areas are domestic security lights and the lighting in commercial glasshouses .
this , he added , is a particular problem in the beverley area .
cctv systems which operate in many towns and cities require stronger lighting which causes further light pollution , he concluded .
and margaret cockbill , who chairs the campaign to protect rural england in east yorkshire says she wants to name and shame firms and organisations that use inefficient lighting , contributing to an orange glow in the sky after dark .
" we would like people to send information about good as well as bad examples of lighting to us . "
she said the data would then be used to lobby parliament over the issue of light pollution .

wheelchair user gareth watkins from cilgerran in pembrokeshire had travelled for two hours to the university hospital of wales to have a pin put in his leg .
but his surgeon told him the operation - which could have helped him walk again - was off because hospital authorities had said there was no funding to treat patients who did not have a cardiff postcode .
cardiff and vale nhs trust has denied funding problems caused the cancellation , and blamed a breakdown in communications within the trust .
mr watkins has had 17 operations following a car crash two years ago which left him in hospital for 12 months and unable to walk .
the hierarchy had pulled the funding off -lsb- my surgeon -rsb- for the next 12 months for anybody who did not have a cardiff postcode gareth watkins he told bbc wales : " i went down to the heath in cardiff and saw my consultant surgeon .
" he informed me he had all the kit ready to do my leg , ready to pin it .
" he had a bed available , but unfortunately the hierarchy had pulled the funding off him for the next 12 months for anybody who did not have a cardiff postcode . "
mr watkins has a hernia on his side which also needs operating on but can not be mended until his leg operation is done .
" it could burst and that will be the end of me , " he added .
mr watkins has had 17 operations since his accident he was expecting to undergo his 18th operation on the same day as the welsh assembly government announced a £ 10m programme for orthopaedic care was to get the go-ahead .
an orthopaedic team at the university of wales is regularly used by other health trusts because of their level of specialism .
commissioning agreements - where one trust buys services from another - normally have to be in place before any operation takes place .
it appears in mr watkins ' case the formal agreement that secures funding for the cardiff trust was not completed .
however , as he was already on the hospital 's books , he should have had the operation on that day .
the trust has apologised to mr watkins and has promised to reschedule his operation within the next few weeks .
' liaising ' cardiff and vale nhs trust said in a statement : " we are pleased to confirm that mr watkins will receive a new date in the next week for his operation with us .
" we apologise for the inconvenience caused to him by a breakdown in communications within the trust .
" the trust continues to provide orthopaedic care to all patients covered by commissioning agreements with us , regardless of where they live .
" the number of orthopaedic patients referred to us for complex trauma procedures has grown because of the high level of specialism within our consultant team .
" we will be liaising with our colleagues on local health boards to take this forward .
" this is certainly not related to emergency pressures . "

more than 300 guests were set to attend the testimonial night for carl wright at everton football club on friday .
mr wright fell into a coma on his way home after losing a british light welterweight title fight in october 1997 when a blood clot formed on his brain .
he has been left with permanent short-term memory loss and his lawyers claim he did not receive adequate medical treatment after the fight , and has received only £ 2,500 compensation .
however , mr wright has been told he can not sue the british boxing board of control because it went into administration following a large claim in the case of michael watson , the boxer injured in a fight with chris eubank in 1991 .
organisers of the event hope to put some of the money raised towards his wedding to long-term partner nicola tierney .
the severity of the injury means mr wright , who lives in maghull with ms tierney and their three children , will never work again .

the design for the glass dome , which would be elevated over crystal palace park , has been created by wilkinson eyre architects - double winners of the architectural award the stirling prize .
it would be built above the plinth where the original crystal palace , created by joseph paxton to house the 1851 great exhibition , stood .
it burned down in 1936 .
the design was unveiled at a meeting of the park 's working group , comprised of 80 organisations , on thursday .
philip kolvin of the crystal palace campaign , which fought to save the top part of the park from being turned into a 20-cinema multiplex , approached the architect chris wilkinson 18 months ago to create a design .
this will be an iconic building of the 21st century .
it will be the first building of its kind in the world architect chris wilkinson mr kolvin : " it 's amazing , i just approached my design gurus and told them i had no money and would they like give up a year of their time to help ?
and they did .
" they wanted to be involved in an exciting project .
" the response was really positive from the majority of people at the meeting .
" some people say it does n't look like the original palace but it comes back to the architectural debate - do we create a pastiche of the past or do we look to the future ? "
the designers want the building , which they say will house the biggest room in london and give visitors views across the city , to echo the original glass building but use up less of the park 's open space .
the original building burnt down in 1936 there will be two floors , the biggest of which is 4,500 square metres .
one level would be used for a variety of exhibitions and would contain a 150 metre long dome hall devoted to sculpture .
the second would contain bars , restaurants and a function room .
the building will be the centre piece of a sculpture park .
chris wilkinson said : " this will be an iconic building of the 21st century .
it will be the first building of its kind in the world . "
camden-based artist antony gormley who designed the angel of the north sculpture has had an input and backs the plans .
the funding for the project would need to found through fundraising , corporate sponsorship and grants .
bromley council , which is part of the working group , will now study the plans .

the design for the glass dome , which would be elevated over crystal palace park , has been created by wilkinson eyre architects - double winners of the architectural award the stirling prize .
it would be built above the plinth where the original crystal palace , created by joseph paxton to house the 1851 great exhibition , stood .
it burned down in 1936 .
the design was unveiled at a meeting of the park 's working group , comprised of 80 organisations , on thursday .
philip kolvin of the crystal palace campaign , which fought to save the top part of the park from being turned into a 20-cinema multiplex , approached the architect chris wilkinson 18 months ago to create a design .
this will be an iconic building of the 21st century .
it will be the first building of its kind in the world architect chris wilkinson mr kolvin : " it 's amazing , i just approached my design gurus and told them i had no money and would they like give up a year of their time to help ?
and they did .
" they wanted to be involved in an exciting project .
" the response was really positive from the majority of people at the meeting .
" some people say it does n't look like the original palace but it comes back to the architectural debate - do we create a pastiche of the past or do we look to the future ? "
the designers want the building , which they say will house the biggest room in london and give visitors views across the city , to echo the original glass building but use up less of the park 's open space .
the original building burnt down in 1936 there will be two floors , the biggest of which is 4,500 square metres .
one level would be used for a variety of exhibitions and would contain a 150 metre long dome hall devoted to sculpture .
the second would contain bars , restaurants and a function room .
the building will be the centre piece of a sculpture park .
chris wilkinson said : " this will be an iconic building of the 21st century .
it will be the first building of its kind in the world . "
camden-based artist antony gormley who designed the angel of the north sculpture has had an input and backs the plans .
the funding for the project would need to found through fundraising , corporate sponsorship and grants .
bromley council , which is part of the working group , will now study the plans .

it would be built above the plinth where the original crystal palace , created by joseph paxton to house the 1851 great exhibition , stood .
it burned down in 1936 .
the design was unveiled at a meeting of the park 's working group , comprised of 80 organisations , on thursday .
philip kolvin of the crystal palace campaign , which fought to save the top part of the park from being turned into a 20-cinema multiplex , approached the architect chris wilkinson 18 months ago to create a design .
this will be an iconic building of the 21st century .
it will be the first building of its kind in the world architect chris wilkinson mr kolvin : " it 's amazing , i just approached my design gurus and told them i had no money and would they like give up a year of their time to help ?
and they did .
" they wanted to be involved in an exciting project .
" the response was really positive from the majority of people at the meeting .
" some people say it does n't look like the original palace but it comes back to the architectural debate - do we create a pastiche of the past or do we look to the future ? "
the designers want the building , which they say will house the biggest room in london and give visitors views across the city , to echo the original glass building but use up less of the park 's open space .
the original building burnt down in 1936 there will be two floors , the biggest of which is 4,500 square metres .
one level would be used for a variety of exhibitions and would contain a 150 metre long dome hall devoted to sculpture .
the second would contain bars , restaurants and a function room .
the building will be the centre piece of a sculpture park .
chris wilkinson said : " this will be an iconic building of the 21st century .
it will be the first building of its kind in the world . "
camden-based artist antony gormley who designed the angel of the north sculpture has had an input and backs the plans .
the funding for the project would need to found through fundraising , corporate sponsorship and grants .
bromley council , which is part of the working group , will now study the plans .

prince charles revealed himself on thursday as the senior member of the royal family accused of involvement in an alleged incident witnessed by a servant .
the claims were strenuously denied .
prince charles , who turns 55 next week , is still in that peculiar limbo which all princes of wales have to face .
while other men might dream of early retirement , his greatest challenge - to be king - is yet to come .
the queen may never abdicate in her son 's favour , but she has been gradually handing over more of her royal duties , such as investiture ceremonies , to him .
his title , though ancient , carries no established or formal role and he has had to create his own - which he has done by active involvement in his organisations .
respected beliefs though criticised for what some call his anachronistic lifestyle , especially his love of hunting , in other ways the prince is remarkably modern .
he takes a keen interest in architecture , young people , the environment and health , believing people should have access to both complementary and orthodox medicine .
the prince 's relationship with camilla parker bowles has become more accepted his espousal of organic farming pre-dated the current huge interest in the subject .
charles ' vociferous , almost evangelical , belief in the benefits of conservation is often ahead of the times .
the prince 's thought that , when king , he might change his title of " defender of the faith " to " defender of faith " , in order to more closely reflect the multi-cultural nature of modern britain , cheered many .
no longer seen as a crank , charles is now generally widely respected for his honesty and sincerely-held beliefs .
his public reputation , severely damaged during his estrangement and eventual divorce from his late wife , has in recent years been slowly but surely rebuilt .
that was due in no small part to the efforts of his former deputy private secretary , mark bolland .
but mr bolland has since undone some of his own good work , with a frank interview with the guardian explaining how he spun media stories in charles 's favour .
burrell revelations the seeming acceptance by the royal family of the prince 's companion , camilla parker bowles , has also been hard won .
she had begun accompanying him on some official duties , and even occasionally wins applause and cheers .
fomer royal butler paul burrell sparked a recent bout of negative publicity but recent revelations about his marriage to princess diana , made in a book by her former butler paul burrell , have threatened to undo everything the prince has been working to achieve .
it was said , in burrell 's book , that the duke of edinburgh had said he could not imagine prince charles preferring camilla to diana .
earlier this year , the collapse of the trial of mr burrell for theft led to an internal inquiry into the way the prince 's household was run .
the report led to prince charles ' trusted aide michael fawcett being cleared of financial impropriety , but he was accused of bending the rules on royal gifts , and resigned .
he has now hit the headlines again , with the surfacing of the latest allegations .
the prince once said of his future role " the most important thing will be to have concern for people and give some form of leadership . "
but he also once quipped that , if he so wished , he could " simply go off and spend the rest of my life skiing " .
if the negative publicity surrounding his household continues , that prospect may seem even more tempting .

prison officers association leader finlay spratt said he would consult with members on friday .
mr spratt described a meeting with nio security minister jane kennedy on thursday as a " complete and utter wasted exercise " .
industrial action was threatened following attacks last month on five members of staff at the high security maghaberry prison outside lisburn , county antrim , which have been linked to a prisoners ' dispute at the jail .
the prison officers also said they would refuse to work overtime in an effort to strengthen their demand for increased security measures at their homes .
however , they received a letter from ms kennedy saying legal action would be taken if they broke the law by taking industrial action , planned for wednesday .
that letter was withdrawn and the threatened action was called off to allow the minister to meet with mr spratt and the poa 's national chairman colin moses on thursday .
' disappointed ' mr spratt said after the talks that he was " angry and disappointed " that ms kennedy had not offered extra money to upgrade security at prison officers ' homes .
mr moses , who travelled from england to attend the meeting said he had expected that there would be resolution to the dispute .
he said he was " frustrated and disappointed " at the minister 's attitude .
in response , ms kennedy said that security measures for prison officers were equal to the threat being posed .
" we provide exactly the same security measures to police officers , members of district policing partnerships , mps and so on , all based upon expert advice given to the officials operating these schemes , " she said .
" it is all based upon an assessment of the risk , which is made by police . "
earlier this week , prison officers in england , scotland and wales , said they would take the appropriate action if their colleagues in northern ireland were disciplined for taking industrial action .

in a move certain to provoke anger in beijing , the president made clear his belief that taiwan and china are " one country on each side " of the taiwan straits .
mr chen has rejected beijing 's ' one-china ' principle china has always warned it would attack the island if it declares independence or drags its feet over reunification .
president chen has signalled his intention to make the debate over whether or not taiwan should declare independence the main issue of this election campaign .
but rejecting beijing 's so-called " one china " principle in his first set of election policy documents is a risky move .
it will annoy the chinese leadership , which sees taiwan as little more than a breakaway province which should be reunified with the mainland .
it could also alienate the majority of voters on the island who , opinion polls suggest , prefer the ambiguous status quo .
analysts point out , though , the president knows he faces a struggle to get himself re-elected .
he may believe that provoking an angry response in beijing could help his chances .
his rival , the opposition nationalist candidate , lien chan , has said taiwan and china should pursue parallel paths without making a decision on unification or independence .

the company said it carried 1.9 million passengers in october , up by 18 % on the same period of 2002 .
that brought its total passenger numbers for the year to late october to 20.6 million , a figure boosted by its takeover of rival budget carrier go last year .
october 's load factor , or the number of passengers carried as a proportion of available seats , rose to 85.5 % from 83.8 % a year earlier .
easyjet 's passenger tally for october fell short of the 2 million carried by arch-rival ryanair , which last year increased its capacity by buying klm 's no-frills subsidiary , buzz .
press report however , ryanair 's load factor for october dipped to 84 % .
analysts have increasingly begun to focus on load factor amid worries that budget airlines have been expanding too quickly .
easyjet shares were up 1.25p at 278.25p in early trade .
easyjet 's latest passenger figures came as the financial times reported that the european commission was poised to declare some of the incentives ryanair has receive for setting up bases at regional european airports illegal .
any such ruling would increase ryanair 's costs , and make it more difficult for the airline to negotiate advantageous deals with other small airports .
ryanair shares were 23 cents lower at 6.73 euros .
