germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban at the u.n. , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough .
on friday , buhlman indicated for the first time germany might consider changing its position on stem cell imports and support a ban on all types of human cloning if that were the only way of bringing the united states and other critics on board .
" i would also be open to this possibility , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper , adding that she did n't want the issue to weigh down negotiations .
in light of recent cloning developments alleged by " dubious scientists " and religious sects , she said , it is more important than ever to reach a deal in the u.n. by the end of the year .
buhlman said she was " fairly certain " that reports from the raelian ufo cult that it had produced two clone babies were fake .
criticism from conservatives , greens alike the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , also said they would seek to pass a full ban on cloning in the german parliament , the parties ' joint spokesman on genetic technology , helmut heiderich , said on friday .
the opposition has criticized chancellor gerhard schröder 's government for not supporting u.s.-led efforts for a global ban on all types of human cloning , including the use of human embryonic stem cells .
the greens , the junior partner in germany 's coalition government , also issued a statement saying the party supports a ban on both types of cloning - a position it says is supported by a majority of germans .
the party said the government 's current policy of negotiating an international ban that only applies to reproductive cloning has been met with " little success , " and that germany should pass a law banning all cloning that it can promote as an example for the rest of the world .
international ethics councils renew calls for ban though few have bought into the claims made by clonaid - a company founded by the raelians - that it has cloned two babies , the development has served as a wake-up call that human cloning is not far away .
and ethics councils in germany , france and the united states and other countries are issuing rallying cries for an international ban . the head of germany 's national ethics council , spiros simitis , has stated in recent weeks that he is close contact with his american and french counterparts .
simitis says that reproductive cloning should not be allowed under any circumstances .
in germany , the cloning of human embryos is already illegal .
so far , the raelian sect has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of having produced the world 's first two clone babies , but the organizations has succeeded in reigniting the heated debate over a technology that is likely to be developed sooner rather than later .
and politicians and religious leaders from major countries - warning of a future filled with everything from cloned sex slaves to human organ farms - are seeking to tie up the legal loose ends .
in france , health minister jean-francois mattei told the le parisien newspaper his government planned to introduce one of the toughest pieces of legislation yet banning reproductive cloning , making the practice a " crime against human dignity " in his country .
the law will call for sentences of up to 20 years in prison for individuals convicted of human cloning .
the bill , he said , would not include a statute of limitations and would allow clones themselves to take legal action against their creators at anytime and in any country .
in germany , a law is already on the books banning most types of human cloning .
under the embryonic protection act passed in january 2002 , germany 's parliament banned reproductive cloning as well as the extraction of stem cells , which requires the destruction of the human embryo .
however , the bundestag does permit the import of human embryonic stem cells from other countries - including israel , which is the biggest exporter to germany .

germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban at the u.n. , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough .
on friday , buhlman indicated for the first time germany might consider changing its position on stem cell imports and support a ban on all types of human cloning if that were the only way of bringing the united states and other critics on board .
" i would also be open to this possibility , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper , adding that she did n't want the issue to weigh down negotiations .
in light of recent cloning developments alleged by " dubious scientists " and religious sects , she said , it is more important than ever to reach a deal in the u.n. by the end of the year .
buhlman said she was " fairly certain " that reports from the raelian ufo cult that it had produced two clone babies were fake .
criticism from conservatives , greens alike the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , also said they would seek to pass a full ban on cloning in the german parliament , the parties ' joint spokesman on genetic technology , helmut heiderich , said on friday .
the opposition has criticized chancellor gerhard schröder 's government for not supporting u.s.-led efforts for a global ban on all types of human cloning , including the use of human embryonic stem cells .
the greens , the junior partner in germany 's coalition government , also issued a statement saying the party supports a ban on both types of cloning - a position it says is supported by a majority of germans .
the party said the government 's current policy of negotiating an international ban that only applies to reproductive cloning has been met with " little success , " and that germany should pass a law banning all cloning that it can promote as an example for the rest of the world .
international ethics councils renew calls for ban though few have bought into the claims made by clonaid - a company founded by the raelians - that it has cloned two babies , the development has served as a wake-up call that human cloning is not far away .
and ethics councils in germany , france and the united states and other countries are issuing rallying cries for an international ban . the head of germany 's national ethics council , spiros simitis , has stated in recent weeks that he is close contact with his american and french counterparts .
simitis says that reproductive cloning should not be allowed under any circumstances .
in germany , the cloning of human embryos is already illegal .
so far , the raelian sect has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of having produced the world 's first two clone babies , but the organizations has succeeded in reigniting the heated debate over a technology that is likely to be developed sooner rather than later .
and politicians and religious leaders from major countries - warning of a future filled with everything from cloned sex slaves to human organ farms - are seeking to tie up the legal loose ends .
in france , health minister jean-francois mattei told the le parisien newspaper his government planned to introduce one of the toughest pieces of legislation yet banning reproductive cloning , making the practice a " crime against human dignity " in his country .
the law will call for sentences of up to 20 years in prison for individuals convicted of human cloning .
the bill , he said , would not include a statute of limitations and would allow clones themselves to take legal action against their creators at anytime and in any country .
in germany , a law is already on the books banning most types of human cloning .
under the embryonic protection act passed in january 2002 , germany 's parliament banned reproductive cloning as well as the extraction of stem cells , which requires the destruction of the human embryo .
however , the bundestag does permit the import of human embryonic stem cells from other countries - including israel , which is the biggest exporter to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2003 germany to host international cloning ban conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims by clonaid 's brigitte boisselier that her company has cloned the first human have sparked global outrage as the global debate over human cloning takes on new urgency , germany said on friday it will host an international conference in may with the goal of putting fresh momentum behind a global ban . the event , to be led by german education and research minister edelgard bulmahn and held in berlin , will seek to accelerate negotiations for an internationally enforcible ban at the united nations .
germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban at the u.n. , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough .
on friday , buhlman indicated for the first time germany might consider changing its position on stem cell imports and support a ban on all types of human cloning if that were the only way of bringing the united states and other critics on board .
" i would also be open to this possibility , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper , adding that she did n't want the issue to weigh down negotiations .
in light of recent cloning developments alleged by " dubious scientists " and religious sects , she said , it is more important than ever to reach a deal in the u.n. by the end of the year .
buhlman said she was " fairly certain " that reports from the raelian ufo cult that it had produced two clone babies were fake .
criticism from conservatives , greens alike the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , also said they would seek to pass a full ban on cloning in the german parliament , the parties ' joint spokesman on genetic technology , helmut heiderich , said on friday .
the opposition has criticized chancellor gerhard schröder 's government for not supporting u.s.-led efforts for a global ban on all types of human cloning , including the use of human embryonic stem cells .
the greens , the junior partner in germany 's coalition government , also issued a statement saying the party supports a ban on both types of cloning - a position it says is supported by a majority of germans .
the party said the government 's current policy of negotiating an international ban that only applies to reproductive cloning has been met with " little success , " and that germany should pass a law banning all cloning that it can promote as an example for the rest of the world .
international ethics councils renew calls for ban though few have bought into the claims made by clonaid - a company founded by the raelians - that it has cloned two babies , the development has served as a wake-up call that human cloning is not far away .
and ethics councils in germany , france and the united states and other countries are issuing rallying cries for an international ban . the head of germany 's national ethics council , spiros simitis , has stated in recent weeks that he is close contact with his american and french counterparts .
simitis says that reproductive cloning should not be allowed under any circumstances .
in germany , the cloning of human embryos is already illegal .
so far , the raelian sect has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of having produced the world 's first two clone babies , but the organizations has succeeded in reigniting the heated debate over a technology that is likely to be developed sooner rather than later .
and politicians and religious leaders from major countries - warning of a future filled with everything from cloned sex slaves to human organ farms - are seeking to tie up the legal loose ends .
in france , health minister jean-francois mattei told the le parisien newspaper his government planned to introduce one of the toughest pieces of legislation yet banning reproductive cloning , making the practice a " crime against human dignity " in his country .
the law will call for sentences of up to 20 years in prison for individuals convicted of human cloning .
the bill , he said , would not include a statute of limitations and would allow clones themselves to take legal action against their creators at anytime and in any country .
in germany , a law is already on the books banning most types of human cloning .
under the embryonic protection act passed in january 2002 , germany 's parliament banned reproductive cloning as well as the extraction of stem cells , which requires the destruction of the human embryo .
however , the bundestag does permit the import of human embryonic stem cells from other countries - including israel , which is the biggest exporter to germany .

" i would also be open to this possibility , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper , adding that she did n't want the issue to weigh down negotiations .
in light of recent cloning developments alleged by " dubious scientists " and religious sects , she said , it is more important than ever to reach a deal in the u.n. by the end of the year .
buhlman said she was " fairly certain " that reports from the raelian ufo cult that it had produced two clone babies were fake .
criticism from conservatives , greens alike the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , also said they would seek to pass a full ban on cloning in the german parliament , the parties ' joint spokesman on genetic technology , helmut heiderich , said on friday .
the opposition has criticized chancellor gerhard schröder 's government for not supporting u.s.-led efforts for a global ban on all types of human cloning , including the use of human embryonic stem cells .
the greens , the junior partner in germany 's coalition government , also issued a statement saying the party supports a ban on both types of cloning - a position it says is supported by a majority of germans .
the party said the government 's current policy of negotiating an international ban that only applies to reproductive cloning has been met with " little success , " and that germany should pass a law banning all cloning that it can promote as an example for the rest of the world .
international ethics councils renew calls for ban though few have bought into the claims made by clonaid - a company founded by the raelians - that it has cloned two babies , the development has served as a wake-up call that human cloning is not far away .
and ethics councils in germany , france and the united states and other countries are issuing rallying cries for an international ban . the head of germany 's national ethics council , spiros simitis , has stated in recent weeks that he is close contact with his american and french counterparts .
simitis says that reproductive cloning should not be allowed under any circumstances .
in germany , the cloning of human embryos is already illegal .
so far , the raelian sect has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of having produced the world 's first two clone babies , but the organizations has succeeded in reigniting the heated debate over a technology that is likely to be developed sooner rather than later .
and politicians and religious leaders from major countries - warning of a future filled with everything from cloned sex slaves to human organ farms - are seeking to tie up the legal loose ends .
in france , health minister jean-francois mattei told the le parisien newspaper his government planned to introduce one of the toughest pieces of legislation yet banning reproductive cloning , making the practice a " crime against human dignity " in his country .
the law will call for sentences of up to 20 years in prison for individuals convicted of human cloning .
the bill , he said , would not include a statute of limitations and would allow clones themselves to take legal action against their creators at anytime and in any country .
in germany , a law is already on the books banning most types of human cloning .
under the embryonic protection act passed in january 2002 , germany 's parliament banned reproductive cloning as well as the extraction of stem cells , which requires the destruction of the human embryo .
however , the bundestag does permit the import of human embryonic stem cells from other countries - including israel , which is the biggest exporter to germany .

germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban at the u.n. , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough .
on friday , buhlman indicated for the first time germany might consider changing its position on stem cell imports and support a ban on all types of human cloning if that were the only way of bringing the united states and other critics on board .
" i would also be open to this possibility , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper , adding that she did n't want the issue to weigh down negotiations .
in light of recent cloning developments alleged by " dubious scientists " and religious sects , she said , it is more important than ever to reach a deal in the u.n. by the end of the year .
buhlman said she was " fairly certain " that reports from the raelian ufo cult that it had produced two clone babies were fake .
criticism from conservatives , greens alike the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , also said they would seek to pass a full ban on cloning in the german parliament , the parties ' joint spokesman on genetic technology , helmut heiderich , said on friday .
the opposition has criticized chancellor gerhard schröder 's government for not supporting u.s.-led efforts for a global ban on all types of human cloning , including the use of human embryonic stem cells .
the greens , the junior partner in germany 's coalition government , also issued a statement saying the party supports a ban on both types of cloning - a position it says is supported by a majority of germans .
the party said the government 's current policy of negotiating an international ban that only applies to reproductive cloning has been met with " little success , " and that germany should pass a law banning all cloning that it can promote as an example for the rest of the world .
international ethics councils renew calls for ban though few have bought into the claims made by clonaid - a company founded by the raelians - that it has cloned two babies , the development has served as a wake-up call that human cloning is not far away .
and ethics councils in germany , france and the united states and other countries are issuing rallying cries for an international ban . the head of germany 's national ethics council , spiros simitis , has stated in recent weeks that he is close contact with his american and french counterparts .
simitis says that reproductive cloning should not be allowed under any circumstances .
in germany , the cloning of human embryos is already illegal .
so far , the raelian sect has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of having produced the world 's first two clone babies , but the organizations has succeeded in reigniting the heated debate over a technology that is likely to be developed sooner rather than later .
and politicians and religious leaders from major countries - warning of a future filled with everything from cloned sex slaves to human organ farms - are seeking to tie up the legal loose ends .
in france , health minister jean-francois mattei told the le parisien newspaper his government planned to introduce one of the toughest pieces of legislation yet banning reproductive cloning , making the practice a " crime against human dignity " in his country .
the law will call for sentences of up to 20 years in prison for individuals convicted of human cloning .
the bill , he said , would not include a statute of limitations and would allow clones themselves to take legal action against their creators at anytime and in any country .
in germany , a law is already on the books banning most types of human cloning .
under the embryonic protection act passed in january 2002 , germany 's parliament banned reproductive cloning as well as the extraction of stem cells , which requires the destruction of the human embryo .
however , the bundestag does permit the import of human embryonic stem cells from other countries - including israel , which is the biggest exporter to germany .
now , a handful of german political parties want to tighten the law . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german religious leaders , scientists condemn " frankenstein " clone doctors in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning .

germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban at the u.n. , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough .
on friday , buhlman indicated for the first time germany might consider changing its position on stem cell imports and support a ban on all types of human cloning if that were the only way of bringing the united states and other critics on board .
" i would also be open to this possibility , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper , adding that she did n't want the issue to weigh down negotiations .
in light of recent cloning developments alleged by " dubious scientists " and religious sects , she said , it is more important than ever to reach a deal in the u.n. by the end of the year .
buhlman said she was " fairly certain " that reports from the raelian ufo cult that it had produced two clone babies were fake .
criticism from conservatives , greens alike the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , also said they would seek to pass a full ban on cloning in the german parliament , the parties ' joint spokesman on genetic technology , helmut heiderich , said on friday .
the opposition has criticized chancellor gerhard schröder 's government for not supporting u.s.-led efforts for a global ban on all types of human cloning , including the use of human embryonic stem cells .
the greens , the junior partner in germany 's coalition government , also issued a statement saying the party supports a ban on both types of cloning - a position it says is supported by a majority of germans .
the party said the government 's current policy of negotiating an international ban that only applies to reproductive cloning has been met with " little success , " and that germany should pass a law banning all cloning that it can promote as an example for the rest of the world .
international ethics councils renew calls for ban though few have bought into the claims made by clonaid - a company founded by the raelians - that it has cloned two babies , the development has served as a wake-up call that human cloning is not far away .
and ethics councils in germany , france and the united states and other countries are issuing rallying cries for an international ban . the head of germany 's national ethics council , spiros simitis , has stated in recent weeks that he is close contact with his american and french counterparts .
simitis says that reproductive cloning should not be allowed under any circumstances .
in germany , the cloning of human embryos is already illegal .
so far , the raelian sect has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of having produced the world 's first two clone babies , but the organizations has succeeded in reigniting the heated debate over a technology that is likely to be developed sooner rather than later .
and politicians and religious leaders from major countries - warning of a future filled with everything from cloned sex slaves to human organ farms - are seeking to tie up the legal loose ends .
in france , health minister jean-francois mattei told the le parisien newspaper his government planned to introduce one of the toughest pieces of legislation yet banning reproductive cloning , making the practice a " crime against human dignity " in his country .
the law will call for sentences of up to 20 years in prison for individuals convicted of human cloning .
the bill , he said , would not include a statute of limitations and would allow clones themselves to take legal action against their creators at anytime and in any country .
in germany , a law is already on the books banning most types of human cloning .
under the embryonic protection act passed in january 2002 , germany 's parliament banned reproductive cloning as well as the extraction of stem cells , which requires the destruction of the human embryo .
however , the bundestag does permit the import of human embryonic stem cells from other countries - including israel , which is the biggest exporter to germany .

and politicians and religious leaders from major countries - warning of a future filled with everything from cloned sex slaves to human organ farms - are seeking to tie up the legal loose ends .
in france , health minister jean-francois mattei told the le parisien newspaper his government planned to introduce one of the toughest pieces of legislation yet banning reproductive cloning , making the practice a " crime against human dignity " in his country .
the law will call for sentences of up to 20 years in prison for individuals convicted of human cloning .
the bill , he said , would not include a statute of limitations and would allow clones themselves to take legal action against their creators at anytime and in any country .
in germany , a law is already on the books banning most types of human cloning .
under the embryonic protection act passed in january 2002 , germany 's parliament banned reproductive cloning as well as the extraction of stem cells , which requires the destruction of the human embryo .
however , the bundestag does permit the import of human embryonic stem cells from other countries - including israel , which is the biggest exporter to germany .

germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban at the u.n. , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough .
on friday , buhlman indicated for the first time germany might consider changing its position on stem cell imports and support a ban on all types of human cloning if that were the only way of bringing the united states and other critics on board .
" i would also be open to this possibility , " she told the berliner zeitung newspaper , adding that she did n't want the issue to weigh down negotiations .
in light of recent cloning developments alleged by " dubious scientists " and religious sects , she said , it is more important than ever to reach a deal in the u.n. by the end of the year .
buhlman said she was " fairly certain " that reports from the raelian ufo cult that it had produced two clone babies were fake .
criticism from conservatives , greens alike the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , also said they would seek to pass a full ban on cloning in the german parliament , the parties ' joint spokesman on genetic technology , helmut heiderich , said on friday .
the opposition has criticized chancellor gerhard schröder 's government for not supporting u.s.-led efforts for a global ban on all types of human cloning , including the use of human embryonic stem cells .
the greens , the junior partner in germany 's coalition government , also issued a statement saying the party supports a ban on both types of cloning - a position it says is supported by a majority of germans .
the party said the government 's current policy of negotiating an international ban that only applies to reproductive cloning has been met with " little success , " and that germany should pass a law banning all cloning that it can promote as an example for the rest of the world .
international ethics councils renew calls for ban though few have bought into the claims made by clonaid - a company founded by the raelians - that it has cloned two babies , the development has served as a wake-up call that human cloning is not far away .
and ethics councils in germany , france and the united states and other countries are issuing rallying cries for an international ban . the head of germany 's national ethics council , spiros simitis , has stated in recent weeks that he is close contact with his american and french counterparts .

criticism from conservatives , greens alike the opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , also said they would seek to pass a full ban on cloning in the german parliament , the parties ' joint spokesman on genetic technology , helmut heiderich , said on friday .
the opposition has criticized chancellor gerhard schröder 's government for not supporting u.s.-led efforts for a global ban on all types of human cloning , including the use of human embryonic stem cells .
the greens , the junior partner in germany 's coalition government , also issued a statement saying the party supports a ban on both types of cloning - a position it says is supported by a majority of germans .
the party said the government 's current policy of negotiating an international ban that only applies to reproductive cloning has been met with " little success , " and that germany should pass a law banning all cloning that it can promote as an example for the rest of the world .
international ethics councils renew calls for ban though few have bought into the claims made by clonaid - a company founded by the raelians - that it has cloned two babies , the development has served as a wake-up call that human cloning is not far away .
and ethics councils in germany , france and the united states and other countries are issuing rallying cries for an international ban . the head of germany 's national ethics council , spiros simitis , has stated in recent weeks that he is close contact with his american and french counterparts .
simitis says that reproductive cloning should not be allowed under any circumstances .
in germany , the cloning of human embryos is already illegal .
so far , the raelian sect has failed to provide evidence supporting its claims of having produced the world 's first two clone babies , but the organizations has succeeded in reigniting the heated debate over a technology that is likely to be developed sooner rather than later .
and politicians and religious leaders from major countries - warning of a future filled with everything from cloned sex slaves to human organ farms - are seeking to tie up the legal loose ends .
in france , health minister jean-francois mattei told the le parisien newspaper his government planned to introduce one of the toughest pieces of legislation yet banning reproductive cloning , making the practice a " crime against human dignity " in his country .
the law will call for sentences of up to 20 years in prison for individuals convicted of human cloning .
the bill , he said , would not include a statute of limitations and would allow clones themselves to take legal action against their creators at anytime and in any country .
in germany , a law is already on the books banning most types of human cloning .
under the embryonic protection act passed in january 2002 , germany 's parliament banned reproductive cloning as well as the extraction of stem cells , which requires the destruction of the human embryo .
however , the bundestag does permit the import of human embryonic stem cells from other countries - including israel , which is the biggest exporter to germany .
now , a handful of german political parties want to tighten the law . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german religious leaders , scientists condemn " frankenstein " clone doctors in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning .

following is the text of a report by the north korean official news agency kcna , which carried the announcement .
the government of the democratic people 's republic of korea in a statement today declared its withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and its total freedom from the binding force of the safeguards accord with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
the statement was issued as regards the fact that a grave situation where the sovereignty of the korean nation and the dprk 's security are seriously violated is prevailing on the korean peninsula , owing to the us vicious hostile policy towards the dprk . "
though we pull out of the npt , we have no intention to produce nuclear weapons " in the statement the dprk government vehemently rejected the 6 january " resolution " of the iaea , considering it as a grave encroachment upon the sovereignty of the dprk and the dignity of the korean nation .
the statement further says : as it has become clear once again that the us persistently seeks to stifle the dprk at any cost and the iaea is used as a tool for executing the us hostile policy towards the dprk , we can no longer remain bound to the npt , allowing the country 's security and the dignity of our nation to be infringed upon .
no iaea monitoring under the grave situation where our state 's supreme interests are most seriously threatened , the dprk government adopts the following decisions to protect the sovereignty of the country and the nation and their right to existence and dignity : firstly , the dprk government declares an automatic and immediate effectuation of its withdrawal from the npt , on which " it unilaterally announced a moratorium as long as it deemed necessary , " according to the 11 june , 1993 , dprk-us joint statement , now that the us has unilaterally abandoned its commitments to stop nuclear threat and renounce hostility towards the dprk , in line with the same statement .
secondly , it declares that the dprk , withdrawing from the npt , is totally free from the binding force of the safeguards accord with the iaea under its article 3 .
' self-defensive measure ' the withdrawal from the npt is a legitimate self-defensive measure taken against the us moves to stifle the dprk and the unreasonable behaviour of the iaea following the us .
though we pull out of the npt , we have no intention to produce nuclear weapons and our nuclear activities at this stage will be confined only to peaceful purposes such as the production of electricity .
if the us drops its hostile policy to stifle the dprk and stops its nuclear threat to it , the dprk may prove through a separate verification between the dprk and the us that it does not make any nuclear weapon .
the united states and the iaea will never evade their responsibilities for compelling the dprk to withdraw from the npt , by ignoring the dprk 's last efforts to seek a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue through negotiations .

a substance secreted by the bat to keep blood flowing shows promise in treating stroke .
scientists in australia say animal tests show it can dissolve blood clots in the brain .
this is fascinating research and holds great potential the stroke association clinical trials on human patients are being carried out in europe , asia and australia .
the enzyme was originally extracted from the saliva of the vampire bat .
it is known as desmodus rotundus salivary plasminogen activator , or dspa , after the bat 's scientific name .
" when the vampire bat bites its victim , it secretes this powerful clot-dissolving -lrb- fibrinolytic -rrb- substance so that the victim 's blood will keep flowing , allowing the bat to feed , " said co-researcher robert metcalf from the monash university department of medicine in victoria .
clot buster the substance is similar to tissue plasminogen activator , a clot-busting drug used to treat heart attack or stroke patients in some countries .
the drug can dissolve blood clots , which cause most heart attacks and strokes .
a bat version of the clot-busting drug could have added advantages .
tests on mice suggest it might be safe to use up to nine hours after the onset of a stroke because there is a lower risk of brain damage .
tissue plasminogen activator is administered to human patients up to three hours after the onset of stroke .
it can not be used after this time because there is a risk of brain damage .
the study was carried out by injecting the bat substance and the conventional treatment into the brains of mice and tracking the survival of brain cells .
dpsa may be safe for longer , according to the animal tests , which are reported in the journal stroke : journal of the american heart association .
' great potential ' however further research is needed , said larry goldstein , chairperson of the american stroke association advisory committee .
" it needs to be understood that this study is limited to mice without stroke and focused only on toxicity , " he said .
" whether this approach will prove either safe or efficacious in improving stroke outcomes requires further testing . "
the comment was echoed by the uk research charity , the stroke association .
director eoin redahan told bbc news online : " this is fascinating research and holds great potential .
" about 80 % of all strokes in the uk are caused by blood clots and so the bat saliva could be very important . "

the deficit has increased for 12 successive months and is back over a $ 1bn -lrb- £ 359m ; $ 576m -rrb- for the first time since august 2000 .
despite the drought , the government has maintained its forecast for export growth this year .
" given these figures , the government remains confident that the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook forecast of export growth of 2 % in 2002/03 remains on track , " said deputy prime minister john anderson .
" these figures point clearly to the continued strength of the australian economy relative to our key trading partners , at the same time as the continuing importance of agriculture to the national economy , " he said .
ballooning deficit the australian bureau of statistics -lrb- abs -rrb- reported the seasonally adjusted trade deficit ballooned to a $ 1.14bn from a $ 957 in october .
australia 's overall strong economy saw imports rise by 1 % to $ 13.8bn , while exports fell by about half a percent to a $ 12.6bn.
rural exports fell by 7 % to a $ 2.25bn dollars due to lower sales of wheat , cotton , and meat .
the abs said the fall in exports was almost totally due to the drought .

the official korean central news agency said that , although pyongyang was pulling out of the npt , it had no intention of producing nuclear weapons . "
our nation will strongly demand from north korea a quick retraction of its statement " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda " our nuclear activities at this stage will be confined only to peaceful purposes such as the production of electricity , " friday 's statement said .
but the bbc 's charles scanlon in tokyo says the decision will be seen as a very serious escalation of the dispute over north korea 's nuclear programme .
international concern over north korea 's intentions has been growing since it expelled two un inspectors last month , and re-activated some of its nuclear facilities at yongbyon .
the announcement coincided with talks in the us state of new mexico between two north korean diplomats and a former us ambassador .
the meeting is not officially sponsored by the bush administration but has its support .
several governments have strongly condemned pyongyang 's decision to quit the npt .
japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda said : " our nation will strongly demand from north korea a quick retraction of its statement . "
french foreign minister dominique de villepin said : " it is a serious decision , heavy with consequences " .
he is in china for two days of talks on the crisis .
the south korean government is to hold an emergency national security council meeting at 0800 gmt on friday to decide how to respond .
the ruling millenium democratic party said in a statement : " the south korean government immediately needs to learn what the north wants , and should seek a solution through close discussions with the united states , japan , china , russia and the european union . "
meanwhile , australia says it will send a senior delegation to north korea next week to discuss the crisis .
serious escalation in its statement , north korea denounced what it called us aggression , saying : " we can no longer remain bound to the -lsb- non-proliferation -rsb- treaty , allowing the country 's security and the dignity of our nation to be infringed upon " .
crisis chronology 16 oct : n korea acknowledges secret nuclear programme , us says 14 nov : oil shipments to n korea halted 22 dec : n korea removes monitoring devices at yongbyon nuclear plant 26 dec : un says 1,000 fuel rods have been moved to the plant 31 dec : un nuclear inspectors leave north korea 6 jan : iaea demands inspectors be readmitted and secret weapons programme halted 7 jan : us " willing to talk " to north korea 10 jan : n korea pulls out of nuclear treaty north korea last announced it was withdrawing from the npt in 1993 , provoking a dangerous confrontation with the united states .
it later suspended the decision and entered talks .

the official korean central news agency said that , although pyongyang was pulling out of the npt , it had no intention of producing nuclear weapons .
our nation will strongly demand from north korea a quick retraction of its statement japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda " our nuclear activities at this stage will be confined only to peaceful purposes such as the production of electricity , " friday 's statement said .
but the bbc 's charles scanlon in tokyo says the decision will be seen as a very serious escalation of the dispute over north korea 's nuclear programme .
international concern over north korea 's intentions has been growing since it expelled two un inspectors last month , and re-activated some of its nuclear facilities at yongbyon .
the announcement coincided with talks in the us state of new mexico between two north korean diplomats and a former us ambassador .
the meeting is not officially sponsored by the bush administration but has its support .

he is in china for two days of talks on the crisis .
the south korean government is to hold an emergency national security council meeting at 0800 gmt on friday to decide how to respond .
the ruling millenium democratic party said in a statement : " the south korean government immediately needs to learn what the north wants , and should seek a solution through close discussions with the united states , japan , china , russia and the european union . "
meanwhile , australia says it will send a senior delegation to north korea next week to discuss the crisis .
serious escalation in its statement , north korea denounced what it called us aggression , saying : " we can no longer remain bound to the -lsb- non-proliferation -rsb- treaty , allowing the country 's security and the dignity of our nation to be infringed upon " .

during the hunt , he will talk to bbc news online about his trials and tribulations .
adrian plant is shocked at the level of uk house prices .
" it is incredible !
for what i am facing paying for a two or three bedroom terraced house in london , i could buy a villa near barcelona with a pool and an acre of land . "
things have moved in the buyer 's favour of late adrian plant returning to the uk after 15 years based in barcelona , adrian has decided it is time to lay down some roots and buy a home .
but even though the heady days of double-digit price growth in london are said to be over , he has been looking since last november without success . : uk property market the house price boom railway cottage adrian , who is unmarried , earns an above average income as a sales director for an american multinational food company but his housing ambitions are modest .
adrian has targeted wandsworth " i would like a nice small railway cottage or mews in the tonsley area of wandsworth , london . "
however , the going rate for such a property is between £ 400,000 and half a million pounds .
" i have some savings to call on but i will still need a hefty mortgage , i am not prepared to over-extend myself . "
prices slashed predictions of a fall in the london 's overheated housing market have been welcomed by adrian .
" things have moved in the buyer 's favour of late and i think by taking a strict line over price i can now drive a hard bargain . "
the asking price for one house mr plant was looking at was slashed by £ 40,000 by a frantic seller but it was not enough to tempt him .
" the market has softened to such an extent that if i was to look a little further afield than wandsworth i could secure a heavy discount . "
agent woe however , the shift in the balance of power from seller to buyer has not yet , it seems , been reflected in the attitudes of local estate agents .
my girlfriend just told me get used to it - estate agents think they have buyers over a barrel adrian plant many homebuyers would recognise adrian 's experience with sharp-suited agents .
" i have been appalled at the level of service i have received - the local agent has a virtual monopoly on the area i am looking in .
" the sales people are pushy , increase your offer to suit them and then do not pass on the offer in a reasonable time to the seller . "
' over a barrel ' in december adrian was infuriated when an agent failed to follow up on an offer he had placed on a property .
adrian plans to be a tough negotiator " having told me that there was a lack of properties available they than told me that they had been very busy , which was rubbish .
" it was a very negative experience and although the agent said the seller would accept only £ 5,000 more than i offered i refused to budge .
" my girlfriend just told me get used to it - estate agents think they have buyers over a barrel . "
but by boxing clever during the coming weeks and not being pressured , adrian hopes to turn the tables in his favour .
do you have advice for adrian as he starts his quest ?
how should he deal with pushy agents and what potential pitfalls await ?
your comments : a few words of advice : be patient , prices are falling and do n't be afraid to haggle .
use the net to help you during the initial searches , will help identify the state of the market !
gregory edwards , england take your time adrian .
try not to " fall in love " with a particular property but put very low bids on many .
identify which properties have been on market for some time -lrb- look at property photo trees etc -rrb- .
also , find a seller who really " needs " to move .
communicate with agent and seller directly .
you are probably better at it than most agents .
good luck !
do not hurry .
even rent for 6 months to give yourself time to secure the property you want at the right price .
it is a buyers market not an agent market !
chris , denmark my advice - move to france and commute adrian , uk there really is a two speed britain on house prices .
last year we moved to a four bed detached in a desirable area of a desirable cheshire town -lrb- manchester stock broker belt -rrb- , near all the right schools and in good order .
it cost £ 170,000 .
as i work in berkshire i checked agents prices , and the same house in a very similar location was £ 500,000 .
what worries me is that the government seems to look out of the windows at westminster , put it 's collective digit in the air and decide upon policy to suit their next sound bite in the capital .
richard hough , uk move back to barcelona and get that house with a pool !
jeremy , uk just remember you 're the one with the cash , first time buyer ?
crikey i 'd snap you up !
mark h , england after you view a place - send some mates round to view it and put in much lower offers than yours : - -rrb- pete , uk i would try and keep the agent in the dark as much as possible ! 1. arrange to see the property through the agent .
2. make offer to the agent in writing subject to the outcome of a survey .
3. make contact with the sellers and inform them your offer and that you informed the agent. also leave your contact details with them , try and get theirs .
this way you know for sure that the sellers are aware of your interest and price .
scott rathbone , uk move back to barcelona ! ! , what does britain offer now ?
high house prices combined with a high cost of living and do n't forget all the pension scandals .
rob , kent my advice - move to france and commute .
the uk is too crowded and prices too high .
you will never forgive yourself when you realise how much you 've paid for a pokey pad .
adrian , uk simple solution which as a first time buyer we did in london : after being asked personal questions by agents that have nothing to do with them , like ' what sort of mortgage do you have / how much do you earn etc etc ? ' - in order to fleece you and see if you are worth bothering with we carried out a private sale .
we found property websites and other peoples ' personal sites great .
not only does the seller save on commission but you do n't have to put up with agents and sometimes their dodgy counterparts ... we were showed round some places by an inexperienced ' tv camera operator ' and an ' it recruitment business owner ' who wanted to secretly sell us his house !
who needs estate agents - solicitors , mortgage advisors etc can do the legal and important stuff .
get on the net ! !
kev wilkinson , london are you mad ?
get the first plane back to barcelona .
mike cresswell , uk i know exactly what adrian 's going through andy , uk i completely relate to adrian 's experiences .
at 24 , i moved to finland because an opportunity came up to experience something different in a different country .
along with it came benefits such as free apartment , free utilities costs etc .
because of this , i am able to save £ 400 - £ 600 a month .
in the uk , i was earning around £ 1,000 a month net and my monthly outgoing came to over £ 800 .
how is someone supposed to get together a deposit for a house in this way ?
how old does someone have to be to get the freedom adults deserve ?
maybe they should raise the adult age from 18 to 40 ? !
i 'm staying away from the uk until there 's a recession !
stuart mcnaughton , finland , ex-pat i 'd go back to spain , get the house with the pool , spain is way ahead of this backward country in many aspects of life !
otherwise take your time , estate agents can be very pushy .
russ , uk the best advice i can give to anyone looking to buy a house in london is " do n't buy in london " .
i just moved into my first house in east anglia , three bedrooms and a big garden , which cost less than £ 120,000 .
i still work in london , and the £ 3,500 i pay for an annual rail ticket is far less than the difference i 'd have to pay for a mortgage on a similar property in london .
plus , trains from london run much later than the tubes so i can always get home after a night out on the town ... unlike some of my london-based friends !
jem , uk do n't rely on estate agents - make sure your local knowledge of where you want to live is top notch .
do property searches on the internet , get the local paper for the area each week and you 'll begin to spot which properties sell quickly and which end up being reduced .
the more knowledgeable you are of your subject matter , the stronger your position against the estate agent .
he works for the seller -lrb- who pays his commission -rrb- so you need to be as well informed as possible .
annie , england the comparison with an villa outside barcelona is not fair .
try to compare it with house prices inside the city limits of barcelona or madrid .
for the house prices in london you can buy a nice villa outside of london too . believe me as we have just done that ! !
marco venzelaar , fulham , london , united kingdom go back to spain .
it 's cheaper , more sun and you can always get a low cost airfare back to the uk whenever you want .
what about renting in the uk , and having a place in the sun too ?
david waugh , uk a villa with pool and an acre of land in sunny barcelona or a tiny victorian terrace in rainy wandsworth ?
sounds like a simple choice but what are the equivalent wages in barca ?
i know exactly what adrian 's going through having bought an astronomically charged , shoe box sized , 2 bed victorian terrace in st albans in the past few months -lrb- 1st time buyer also -rrb- .
the problem is caused by low interest rates and a shortage of houses on the market .
houses are being priced depending on what people can get a mortgage for rather than what the houses are really worth .
plus finding a decent estate agents is a huge lottery .
good luck !
andy , uk firstly , i have real sympathy for adrian 's current situation , having been there myself in the past .
i know it is easier said than done but i would recommend that adrian tries to purchase his house directly from a seller .
i am fortunate that i was able to do this with my flat in 1996 .
i am originally from canada and i am appalled at the way the housing market works in this country .
the way i look at it , dealing directly with the seller already eliminates one potential hurdle which is the estate agent .
what surprised me when i was flat hunting was that one property can be on numerous estate agents books at the same time , so you get countless conflicting stories regarding the same property .
the stress that people have to go through in england just should n't be allowed .
the whole process completely suits the solicitors as well because of the lengthy times involved in purchasing a property .
my question to adrian is why leave barcelona ?
james thomson , london u.k. the internet proved a valuable ally in searching for a house .
it gave me a more complete picture of the london market and had the added bonus of keeping interaction with estate agents to a minimal ! !
alex tapaccos , uk if i were you , i 'd move back to barcelona david , uk wait a few months / year until the inevitable crash erwin saxon , uk i 'm going to keep renting , my rent has dropped by 50 % and i live in a beautiful cottage in the new forest .
it 's far cheaper for me to pay rent than a mortgage !
house prices are going to come tumbling down and i will be there to pick up the pieces .
not stuck with negative equity for the next 25yrs .
this is not a good time to invest !
paul , uk i know one property professional who found his ideal house and cut out agents altogether .
he did this by printing letters with details of the kind of property he was seeking and how he could be contacted then he posted these through the letterboxes of all the houses he liked the look of in his target area .
he caught a number of people just before they about to put their houses on the market giving him a good choice .
everyone involved was delighted to dispense with the need for , and expense of , an agent .
sounds time consuming ?
well , yes , you have to post a lot of letters to find your dream home but this need not take more than a few hours if your target area is well defined .
think of all the time saved not being led up various garden paths by those double-talking agents .
always pay for a good surveyor and solicitor and you will ensure there is no more risk buying in this way .
robert , uk remember the place you buy will be your home and you do n't want to resent paying over the odds for it .
most importantly of all do n't stress out .
if you can hold your nerve now you 'll be laughing when the estate agents are crying .
quentin casares , england if i were you , i 'd move back to barcelona .
this country is finished .
david , uk make sure you think how rising water levels and increasingly bad flooding could affect any property you look at - otherwise , you could stand to lose a lot of money .
jo , uk listen to your girlfriend , she know what she is talking about .
at the end of the day if you want something you have to pay the price for it .
to a certain extent you can haggle but the market will dictate what a house is worth !
alan cole , england i think the tide is slowly moving in favour of the buyer kyriakos , uk why buy now ?
the market is on a crest , future sentiment favours a static / negative move .
so probability is a future purchase will be at today 's level or lower .
i 'd rent for a year .
paul , switzerland my husband -lrb- a police officer -rrb- and i -lrb- a pa -rrb- are in our twenties and have a combined income of around 30k .
to purchase even the most basic two up , two down terraced house in southampton we 'd need at least 36k per year not to mention a deposit and legal fees .
the housing market is just a beast looking to devour young couples .
we ca n't even think of starting a family in the present financial climate .
it 's simply unfair .
becky boxall , uk -lrb- southampton -rrb- wait a while ! !
on the top right of this page there is a link with title " 30 % fall ? " .
in short - capital economics think prices will drop by up to 30 % over the next few years .
buying a property now -lrb- especially in london -rrb- would be financial suicide - unless you can haggle about 30 % off the current asking price ! !
owen , uk if people are prepared to look at areas outside the ones deemed ' trendy ' there are plenty of great properties out there .
you 've just got to look a bit harder .
dom cork , london , england i can totally relate with adrian 's experience .
i 'm a first time buyer and have been looking to get on the property ladder in london for over a year .
i think the tide is slowly moving in favour of the buyer as i 've noticed that quite a few vendors are willing to slash the initial offer price by 5 % or 10 % .
my advice is be patient .
buying a house is a big commitment so make sure you stick to your requirements and , most importantly , budget !
good luck !
kyriakos , uk as an agent it does concern me when i hear from people like adrian receiving such a poor service from estate agents .
the industry has improved immensely over the past decade and most agents are genuine hard working professional people .
you will know when you have found a good agent - they will listen too you and build a good rapport - and if you have proved to be reliable and a genuine buyer -lrb- turning up for viewings is always a good start ! -rrb- then you will get the first call when the long awaited gem hits the market .
you must remember , whilst i am not sticking up for bad customer service , an agent can easily receive many more enquires -lrb- a vast number from non-serious time wasting purchasers -rrb- than he can realistically deal with .
you must make sure you stand out from the crowd - befriend your agent and you will be taken seriously making friends with an estate agent might not be everyone ¿ s idea of fun but it will work - after all most of us are human -lrb- apparently ! -rrb-
good luck !
steven herd , london , uk i think the government should step in and force agents to abandon commission on selling in favour of a flat fee - so that they are more impartial throughout the deal .
julian corallo , uk with the same name as me i can empathise with the other adrian plant having recently moved for the seventh time adrian plant , uk several of my friends in the area are trying to sell properties at the moment , with very little success .
agents are still trying to talk it up , but the market is heading lower . take your time & good luck phil , uk try to talk and deal direct with the seller , i only secured my house by constantly talking to the seller and making sure the relationship was strong , you are a no chain individual and as such sellers will like you a lot .
make them aware of this and your offer could be accepted even though it is lower than a chained individual who has a lot of baggage .
good luck richard , uk i 'm so pleased to hear that you 're ignoring the hype from the estate agents .
we 've been looking for a year during which time most undesirable properties have remained unsold , whilst the estate agents criticise us for not finding anywhere ! ! !
we 've been told that we should snap places up at " last years price " , take whatever we can stretch ourselves to buy , etc .
trouble is , there are too many people listening and panic buying - if first time buyers refused to be ripped off by ridiculous prices they would start to return to realistic levels .
my advice - leave england !
carol , uk i 've just sold my house but am reluctant to pay my agent a fee when i appear to have done all the chasing myself !
matthew smith , uk not all agents are useless .
find one in the area you are looking in .
there are no agents in that area that have a monopoly .
i have just counted up 26 agents within two miles of the tonsleys .
find one negotiator if you are truly desperate and retain them with fixed fee to find you a property . £ 2,000 is not a lot to pay to someone to help guide you through a maze , which you have obviously lost touch with whilst you have been in the less frenetic life in spain .
tony d 'alton , uk wish you all the luck as you need it in this business .
we are in a similar position to you .
having lost two properties due to subsidence , and not wanting to lose our buyer , we have gone ahead and moved into a rented property end of november 2002 , and have started looking again , in woodford green .
so the thing to remember is do n't completely rely on estate agents , as all they are after is their commission and they are fast talking salesmen .
form a good rapport with your vendor and communicate directly once you have put the deposit .
once again wish you all the very best in the game of house hunting .
roxana , uk i agree with jeremy - why bother getting yourself in debt to the tune of half a million pounds to buy a modest house in london ?
prices are n't going to come down unless buyers finally decide enough is enough , and that 50-year mortgages are the stuff of sheer madness .
the whole thing is lunacy .
london simply is n't worth this kind of money .
i 'm currently renting in london , but when the time comes to buy i will wave farewell to the capital and it 's mad property prices and move back to my native north-east , where prices are at least vaguely sensible and i can be sure i 'm getting some kind of value for money .
paul , uk well done adrian !
if more people stuck to their guns like you we would n't have such over inflated house prices .
carry on with what your doing and someone will crack in the end .
it 's time for buyers to realise that we control the market price and if you think its over priced do n't buy and do n't panic .
chris , uk just remember , all the talk about it being a buyers markets only serves to fuel the recent dips in house prices .
this is fine as a buyer in the short run , but remember , that housing prices will continue to fall over the longer term if attitudes / talk / media continue to depress them .
large mortgage with negative equity - not a great place to be chris , england with the same name as me i can empathise with the other adrian plant having recently moved for the seventh time .
you need to tell the estate agents what they need to do and if they fail you go direct to the client .
they will get the message eventually .the market will turn in your favour so be patient too .
adrian plant , uk it 's a pity you work in london .
living in north east scotland can be much better .
outside aberdeen you can get a very good house for £ 150,000 or less .
ok you may have to travel 20 miles to work , but it only takes half an hour , and the weather 's not as bad as you may think .
why spend all your money on a house ?
gordon duncan , scotland do you really want to live in london ? ? ?
there are so many nice places around the world where you can spend your money better .
good luck !
paolo , italy i sympathise with you - as a prospective first time buyer in edinburgh i am no further forward than i was over a year ago .
everyone tells me it will happen eventually and that " if it 's meant for you it will not go by you " so keep trying !
angela curran , scotland i agree with jeremy , go back to spain and avoid overcrowded , over-priced and over-rated london .
matt , uk do as thousands of sensible people have done over the past few years - move out of the south east . £ 200k buys you a decent 4 bedroom family home in far more desirable areas of the country -lrb- e.g. cheshire -rrb- than london or its surrounding counties .
people in the south east will realise the true " benefits " of their grossly over-inflated house prices -lrb- and really how well off they are -rrb- when they ca n't educate their children -lrb- no teachers available - even in private schools -rrb- , ca n't find a doctor , have long waiting lists for surgery , ca n't obtain repairs on their houses -lrb- no real tradesmen -rrb- etc etc rising house prices are causing real damage to the country and to our citizens standard of living .
estate agents and solicitors are the few genuine benefactors of over inflated prices .
len powell -lrb- dr -rrb- len , uk do n't believe that prices in london are suddenly going to fall drastically , leaving you and other buyers in a better position .
the london situation remains the same ... that for the majority of mid-range buyers , there are simply not enough properties to go round .
there are simply not enough homes for the number of people joining the property market each year , so modest and mid range properties will continue to sell for inflated prices and we just have to accept it .
trying to ' drive a hard bargain ' or ' wait for the market to fall ' will only result in disappointment ...
chris souvlis , uk i am in the middle of purchasing a property at this moment .
it has been a complete nightmare .
the thing that has struck me is that if we had the scottish system of house buying i would have had no problems what so ever .
why ca n't we adopt their way ?
i have had to endure people putting in offers not just on my property but others in ' the chain ' and then withdraw just before exchange .
i have felt powerless and depressed by the whole experience .
someone needs to do something it 's a joke .
the only people who win at the end are the solicitors who get paid even if there is no sale .
enough is enough , if i move i will never put myself through this again .
lauren hopcutt , england will people stop bashing solicitors ?
nick , uk do n't think it 's over when you finally find a house and have an offer accepted- then the fun really begins with the chain dilemmas !
we made an offer in on a house in april , it was accepted the next day but seven months later the chain of nine buyers / sellers had n't been complete .
the chain feel through 3 times .
just as it began to look promising , our vendor then upped the price by £ 15 , 000 !
needless to say we , withdrew , found another house and made a conditional offer based on it being chain free .
good luck jacqueline bloomfield , uk bide your time and do n't over-commit yourself .
in most areas of england today , house prices are running way ahead of average salaries , making a mockery of the property market vested interest view that housing is still " affordable " .
when interest rates eventually go up , today ¿ s buyers who have stretched themselves will suffer .
buyer beware is sound advice in today ¿ s property market .
martin , uk consider the possibility of a company transfer to america .
my house was $ 85,000 .
for that i got 2,500 square feet -lrb- 3 times the size of my parents house in england -rrb- , basement , 2 car garage .
steve , usa -lrb- ex uk -rrb- i have just come back from london , and what you get for £ 400,000 is rubbish .
in wales you can get a nice house for £ 90,000 , good job , and a lot less traffic .
i can not see why people tie themselves down to a tiny flat costing nearly half a million pounds .
the rest of the country is laughing at londoners , the place is rubbish , traffic nearly worst in the world , high prices everywhere .
i would never live there , even if prices of homes were £ 20,000 .
ian griffiths , south wales i 'm in same situation as adrian as a first time buyer looking in greater london since september .
i have viewed countless properties but my gut feeling is they are simply not worth the hefty price tag despite the agent 's best sales pitch .
i have now taken the decision to continue renting for another year and only buy if and when some sensibility returns to the market .
if not i will simply relocate to somewhere that gives me real value for money .
david , uk build yourself a new home instead .
one in 10 new homes are self-built and for a fraction of the cost .
you do n't have to deal with pesky estate agents and you get to design the house of your dreams .
ricky , uk the insane house price bubble is about to burst .
i currently rent and after reading many articles suggesting that ' buy-to-rent ' people are now struggling to find tenants i asked for a £ 200 / month reduction in my rent for the coming year , the agency agreed immediately ! ! !
i think i 'll just sit tight in my cheap but very well appointed rented accommodation for now and buy a nice house in 18 months or so when house prices massively correct themselves .
james maddison , uk as a first time buyer who moved to scotland for the cheaper house prices , i must say i recommend adrian move here .
you can get a superb house in glasgow for £ 150,000 .
the buying and selling system is vastly superior and the cost of living is around 25 % cheaper .
this more than makes up for the lower wages .
we are planning to buy a 2 bed terrace flat and do it up , and i don ¿ t think it will cost us more than £ 70k .
now that ¿ s what i call a realistic starter home price .
richard muschamp , scotland living in london has very few benefits !
for some time i commuted from hertford shire .
i believed that moving to london would give me more time to myself .
however , all the time saved on commuting is now spent stuck in traffic ¿ or avoiding tube closures .
even a night out is infact more difficult now the tubes stop running at a ridiculously early hour and the night bus is not a comfortable journey .
compared to cities such as paris , sydney and of course barcelona out capital is a complete shambles !
what scares me is that we all know how awful transport and living costs are ¿ but we also know that it seems to be getting worse rather than better .
dawn , uk adrian , if you are looking to own your property long-term -lrb- i.e.5-10 years -rrb- then might i suggest pay a bit extra for a house that can be improved and extended to your own needs .
there will be a slight drop in london by as much as 10 % to 20 % but that would be it in the next 2-3 years .
thereafter it will resort to increase in growth .
the possibility of going into negative equity does depend on how much cash you put in but again that will only be for 2-3 years .
by 2020 -lrb- a long way a way -rrb- there will be an extra 5 million people so your property will always be a wise long term investment .
be realistic and always keep some money aside for a rainy day for the mortgage -lrb- say six months worth -rrb- .good luck .
bobby ghosh , uk make a written offer to the vendor via the agent , subject to survey and contract .
ask the agent to forward your offer to the vendor with his recommendation / opinion on your offer in writing offer and provide you with a copy of his letter to the vendor .
remember if it 's not written down it might not have happened .
make sure the agent works for his fee and the vendor is aware of your interest in the property .
best of luck .
david , uk will people stop bashing solicitors ?
they do far more work for far lower fees than estate agents and most high street lawyers earn less than plumbers or electricians yet work longer hours .
a good solicitor will save you far more than he costs you .
nick , uk how much is your time worth ?
i mean , how much do you really value your personal time ?
do you enjoy the delays and congestion on public transport ?
can you suffer the long daily commute , just for the chance to own your own slice of the ¿ country ¿ ?
long walks home from remote stations -lrb- return trip -rrb- .
the decision to purchase a property should be made with the view of how you value your life -lrb- style -rrb- present and future .
the whinge on london price increases is as old as the properties in the capital .
better to accept it , take a modest leap and be happy .
you 're worth it .
gerard , london my advice to adrian would be to rent for a while , i think everyone is talking down the market , and being realistic .
the wages in london just do not allow the average person a chance of getting on the ladder on their own .
as the need for single occupant dwellings is increasing , it makes getting the first step of the ladder even harder , if your on your own .
this is going to lead to a shortage of skilled professionals and the infrastructure of london and the south east is suffering .
brad cutter , london uk house price inflation has been greater in spain than in the uk over the last few years .
you are n't going to get value for money in barcelona or madrid relative to local wages either , so ignore the " go back to spain " posters .
they do n't know what they are talking about .
russ , uk i sympathise .
i moved back to the uk at the end of october 2002 after 18 years in asia to work in east anglia .
i will rent while it looks like property prices are likely to fall .
luckily i have the option of waiting as my family wo n't move here for some time due to school issues .
chris , uk as a first time buyer you have to be cautious , but do n't be under any illusions that prices will ' crash ' in london .
interest rates are low and the amount of good property actually available will always sustain the market to a certain degree .
furthermore , if prices dropped 10 % -20 % , speculators , etc. would possibly move in .
the key in uncertain times is to purchase in a ' good area ' , this should help protect you in the long run .
gary cox , london , uk i can fully empathise with adrian 's situation - canny estate agents , gazumping and the costs of hunting around etc etc .
we solved the problem by using a homesearch / aquisition agent - there are plenty in your part of the world - a relatively new industry but takes the pain away , that 's for sure , look in your yellow pages / internet or under ' relocation agents ' or homesearch .
we did and have never looked back .
g t leatherdale , uk a few words of advice : be patient , prices are falling and do n't be afraid to haggle .
use the net to help you during the initial searches , will help identify the state of the market !

during the hunt , he will talk to bbc news online about his trials and tribulations .
adrian plant is shocked at the level of uk house prices .
" it is incredible !
for what i am facing paying for a two or three bedroom terraced house in london , i could buy a villa near barcelona with a pool and an acre of land . "
things have moved in the buyer 's favour of late adrian plant returning to the uk after 15 years based in barcelona , adrian has decided it is time to lay down some roots and buy a home .
but even though the heady days of double-digit price growth in london are said to be over , he has been looking since last november without success . : uk property market the house price boom railway cottage adrian , who is unmarried , earns an above average income as a sales director for an american multinational food company but his housing ambitions are modest .
adrian has targeted wandsworth " i would like a nice small railway cottage or mews in the tonsley area of wandsworth , london . "
however , the going rate for such a property is between £ 400,000 and half a million pounds .
" i have some savings to call on but i will still need a hefty mortgage , i am not prepared to over-extend myself . "
prices slashed predictions of a fall in the london 's overheated housing market have been welcomed by adrian .
" things have moved in the buyer 's favour of late and i think by taking a strict line over price i can now drive a hard bargain . "
the asking price for one house mr plant was looking at was slashed by £ 40,000 by a frantic seller but it was not enough to tempt him .
" the market has softened to such an extent that if i was to look a little further afield than wandsworth i could secure a heavy discount . "
agent woe however , the shift in the balance of power from seller to buyer has not yet , it seems , been reflected in the attitudes of local estate agents .
my girlfriend just told me get used to it - estate agents think they have buyers over a barrel adrian plant many homebuyers would recognise adrian 's experience with sharp-suited agents .
" i have been appalled at the level of service i have received - the local agent has a virtual monopoly on the area i am looking in .
" the sales people are pushy , increase your offer to suit them and then do not pass on the offer in a reasonable time to the seller . "
' over a barrel ' in december adrian was infuriated when an agent failed to follow up on an offer he had placed on a property .
adrian plans to be a tough negotiator " having told me that there was a lack of properties available they than told me that they had been very busy , which was rubbish .
" it was a very negative experience and although the agent said the seller would accept only £ 5,000 more than i offered i refused to budge .
" my girlfriend just told me get used to it - estate agents think they have buyers over a barrel . "
but by boxing clever during the coming weeks and not being pressured , adrian hopes to turn the tables in his favour .
do you have advice for adrian as he starts his quest ?
how should he deal with pushy agents and what potential pitfalls await ?
your comments : a few words of advice : be patient , prices are falling and do n't be afraid to haggle .
use the net to help you during the initial searches , will help identify the state of the market !
gregory edwards , england take your time adrian .
try not to " fall in love " with a particular property but put very low bids on many .
identify which properties have been on market for some time -lrb- look at property photo trees etc -rrb- .
also , find a seller who really " needs " to move .
communicate with agent and seller directly .
you are probably better at it than most agents .
good luck !
do not hurry .
even rent for 6 months to give yourself time to secure the property you want at the right price .
it is a buyers market not an agent market !
chris , denmark my advice - move to france and commute adrian , uk there really is a two speed britain on house prices .
last year we moved to a four bed detached in a desirable area of a desirable cheshire town -lrb- manchester stock broker belt -rrb- , near all the right schools and in good order .
it cost £ 170,000 .
as i work in berkshire i checked agents prices , and the same house in a very similar location was £ 500,000 .
what worries me is that the government seems to look out of the windows at westminster , put it 's collective digit in the air and decide upon policy to suit their next sound bite in the capital .
richard hough , uk move back to barcelona and get that house with a pool !
jeremy , uk just remember you 're the one with the cash , first time buyer ?
crikey i 'd snap you up !
mark h , england after you view a place - send some mates round to view it and put in much lower offers than yours : - -rrb- pete , uk i would try and keep the agent in the dark as much as possible ! 1. arrange to see the property through the agent .
2. make offer to the agent in writing subject to the outcome of a survey .
3. make contact with the sellers and inform them your offer and that you informed the agent. also leave your contact details with them , try and get theirs .
this way you know for sure that the sellers are aware of your interest and price .
scott rathbone , uk move back to barcelona ! ! , what does britain offer now ?
high house prices combined with a high cost of living and do n't forget all the pension scandals .
rob , kent my advice - move to france and commute .
the uk is too crowded and prices too high .
you will never forgive yourself when you realise how much you 've paid for a pokey pad .
adrian , uk simple solution which as a first time buyer we did in london : after being asked personal questions by agents that have nothing to do with them , like ' what sort of mortgage do you have / how much do you earn etc etc ? ' - in order to fleece you and see if you are worth bothering with we carried out a private sale .
we found property websites and other peoples ' personal sites great .
not only does the seller save on commission but you do n't have to put up with agents and sometimes their dodgy counterparts ... we were showed round some places by an inexperienced ' tv camera operator ' and an ' it recruitment business owner ' who wanted to secretly sell us his house !
who needs estate agents - solicitors , mortgage advisors etc can do the legal and important stuff .
get on the net ! !
kev wilkinson , london are you mad ?
get the first plane back to barcelona .
mike cresswell , uk i know exactly what adrian 's going through andy , uk i completely relate to adrian 's experiences .
at 24 , i moved to finland because an opportunity came up to experience something different in a different country .
along with it came benefits such as free apartment , free utilities costs etc .
because of this , i am able to save £ 400 - £ 600 a month .
in the uk , i was earning around £ 1,000 a month net and my monthly outgoing came to over £ 800 .
how is someone supposed to get together a deposit for a house in this way ?
how old does someone have to be to get the freedom adults deserve ?
maybe they should raise the adult age from 18 to 40 ? !
i 'm staying away from the uk until there 's a recession !
stuart mcnaughton , finland , ex-pat i 'd go back to spain , get the house with the pool , spain is way ahead of this backward country in many aspects of life !
otherwise take your time , estate agents can be very pushy .
russ , uk the best advice i can give to anyone looking to buy a house in london is " do n't buy in london " .
i just moved into my first house in east anglia , three bedrooms and a big garden , which cost less than £ 120,000 .
i still work in london , and the £ 3,500 i pay for an annual rail ticket is far less than the difference i 'd have to pay for a mortgage on a similar property in london .
plus , trains from london run much later than the tubes so i can always get home after a night out on the town ... unlike some of my london-based friends !
jem , uk do n't rely on estate agents - make sure your local knowledge of where you want to live is top notch .
do property searches on the internet , get the local paper for the area each week and you 'll begin to spot which properties sell quickly and which end up being reduced .
the more knowledgeable you are of your subject matter , the stronger your position against the estate agent .
he works for the seller -lrb- who pays his commission -rrb- so you need to be as well informed as possible .
annie , england the comparison with an villa outside barcelona is not fair .
try to compare it with house prices inside the city limits of barcelona or madrid .
for the house prices in london you can buy a nice villa outside of london too . believe me as we have just done that ! !
marco venzelaar , fulham , london , united kingdom go back to spain .
it 's cheaper , more sun and you can always get a low cost airfare back to the uk whenever you want .
what about renting in the uk , and having a place in the sun too ?
david waugh , uk a villa with pool and an acre of land in sunny barcelona or a tiny victorian terrace in rainy wandsworth ?
sounds like a simple choice but what are the equivalent wages in barca ?
i know exactly what adrian 's going through having bought an astronomically charged , shoe box sized , 2 bed victorian terrace in st albans in the past few months -lrb- 1st time buyer also -rrb- .
the problem is caused by low interest rates and a shortage of houses on the market .
houses are being priced depending on what people can get a mortgage for rather than what the houses are really worth .
plus finding a decent estate agents is a huge lottery .
good luck !
andy , uk firstly , i have real sympathy for adrian 's current situation , having been there myself in the past .
i know it is easier said than done but i would recommend that adrian tries to purchase his house directly from a seller .
i am fortunate that i was able to do this with my flat in 1996 .
i am originally from canada and i am appalled at the way the housing market works in this country .
the way i look at it , dealing directly with the seller already eliminates one potential hurdle which is the estate agent .
what surprised me when i was flat hunting was that one property can be on numerous estate agents books at the same time , so you get countless conflicting stories regarding the same property .
the stress that people have to go through in england just should n't be allowed .
the whole process completely suits the solicitors as well because of the lengthy times involved in purchasing a property .
my question to adrian is why leave barcelona ?
james thomson , london u.k. the internet proved a valuable ally in searching for a house .
it gave me a more complete picture of the london market and had the added bonus of keeping interaction with estate agents to a minimal ! !
alex tapaccos , uk if i were you , i 'd move back to barcelona david , uk wait a few months / year until the inevitable crash erwin saxon , uk i 'm going to keep renting , my rent has dropped by 50 % and i live in a beautiful cottage in the new forest .
it 's far cheaper for me to pay rent than a mortgage !
house prices are going to come tumbling down and i will be there to pick up the pieces .
not stuck with negative equity for the next 25yrs .
this is not a good time to invest !
paul , uk i know one property professional who found his ideal house and cut out agents altogether .
he did this by printing letters with details of the kind of property he was seeking and how he could be contacted then he posted these through the letterboxes of all the houses he liked the look of in his target area .
he caught a number of people just before they about to put their houses on the market giving him a good choice .
everyone involved was delighted to dispense with the need for , and expense of , an agent .
sounds time consuming ?
well , yes , you have to post a lot of letters to find your dream home but this need not take more than a few hours if your target area is well defined .
think of all the time saved not being led up various garden paths by those double-talking agents .
always pay for a good surveyor and solicitor and you will ensure there is no more risk buying in this way .
robert , uk remember the place you buy will be your home and you do n't want to resent paying over the odds for it .
most importantly of all do n't stress out .
if you can hold your nerve now you 'll be laughing when the estate agents are crying .
quentin casares , england if i were you , i 'd move back to barcelona .
this country is finished .
david , uk make sure you think how rising water levels and increasingly bad flooding could affect any property you look at - otherwise , you could stand to lose a lot of money .
jo , uk listen to your girlfriend , she know what she is talking about .
at the end of the day if you want something you have to pay the price for it .
to a certain extent you can haggle but the market will dictate what a house is worth !
alan cole , england i think the tide is slowly moving in favour of the buyer kyriakos , uk why buy now ?
the market is on a crest , future sentiment favours a static / negative move .
so probability is a future purchase will be at today 's level or lower .
i 'd rent for a year .
paul , switzerland my husband -lrb- a police officer -rrb- and i -lrb- a pa -rrb- are in our twenties and have a combined income of around 30k .
to purchase even the most basic two up , two down terraced house in southampton we 'd need at least 36k per year not to mention a deposit and legal fees .
the housing market is just a beast looking to devour young couples .
we ca n't even think of starting a family in the present financial climate .
it 's simply unfair .
becky boxall , uk -lrb- southampton -rrb- wait a while ! !
on the top right of this page there is a link with title " 30 % fall ? " .
in short - capital economics think prices will drop by up to 30 % over the next few years .
buying a property now -lrb- especially in london -rrb- would be financial suicide - unless you can haggle about 30 % off the current asking price ! !
owen , uk if people are prepared to look at areas outside the ones deemed ' trendy ' there are plenty of great properties out there .
you 've just got to look a bit harder .
dom cork , london , england i can totally relate with adrian 's experience .
i 'm a first time buyer and have been looking to get on the property ladder in london for over a year .
i think the tide is slowly moving in favour of the buyer as i 've noticed that quite a few vendors are willing to slash the initial offer price by 5 % or 10 % .
my advice is be patient .
buying a house is a big commitment so make sure you stick to your requirements and , most importantly , budget !
good luck !
kyriakos , uk as an agent it does concern me when i hear from people like adrian receiving such a poor service from estate agents .
the industry has improved immensely over the past decade and most agents are genuine hard working professional people .
you will know when you have found a good agent - they will listen too you and build a good rapport - and if you have proved to be reliable and a genuine buyer -lrb- turning up for viewings is always a good start ! -rrb- then you will get the first call when the long awaited gem hits the market .
you must remember , whilst i am not sticking up for bad customer service , an agent can easily receive many more enquires -lrb- a vast number from non-serious time wasting purchasers -rrb- than he can realistically deal with .
you must make sure you stand out from the crowd - befriend your agent and you will be taken seriously making friends with an estate agent might not be everyone ¿ s idea of fun but it will work - after all most of us are human -lrb- apparently ! -rrb-
good luck !
steven herd , london , uk i think the government should step in and force agents to abandon commission on selling in favour of a flat fee - so that they are more impartial throughout the deal .
julian corallo , uk with the same name as me i can empathise with the other adrian plant having recently moved for the seventh time adrian plant , uk several of my friends in the area are trying to sell properties at the moment , with very little success .
agents are still trying to talk it up , but the market is heading lower . take your time & good luck phil , uk try to talk and deal direct with the seller , i only secured my house by constantly talking to the seller and making sure the relationship was strong , you are a no chain individual and as such sellers will like you a lot .
make them aware of this and your offer could be accepted even though it is lower than a chained individual who has a lot of baggage .
good luck richard , uk i 'm so pleased to hear that you 're ignoring the hype from the estate agents .
we 've been looking for a year during which time most undesirable properties have remained unsold , whilst the estate agents criticise us for not finding anywhere ! ! !
we 've been told that we should snap places up at " last years price " , take whatever we can stretch ourselves to buy , etc .
trouble is , there are too many people listening and panic buying - if first time buyers refused to be ripped off by ridiculous prices they would start to return to realistic levels .
my advice - leave england !
carol , uk i 've just sold my house but am reluctant to pay my agent a fee when i appear to have done all the chasing myself !
matthew smith , uk not all agents are useless .
find one in the area you are looking in .
there are no agents in that area that have a monopoly .
i have just counted up 26 agents within two miles of the tonsleys .
find one negotiator if you are truly desperate and retain them with fixed fee to find you a property . £ 2,000 is not a lot to pay to someone to help guide you through a maze , which you have obviously lost touch with whilst you have been in the less frenetic life in spain .
tony d 'alton , uk wish you all the luck as you need it in this business .
we are in a similar position to you .
having lost two properties due to subsidence , and not wanting to lose our buyer , we have gone ahead and moved into a rented property end of november 2002 , and have started looking again , in woodford green .
so the thing to remember is do n't completely rely on estate agents , as all they are after is their commission and they are fast talking salesmen .
form a good rapport with your vendor and communicate directly once you have put the deposit .
once again wish you all the very best in the game of house hunting .
roxana , uk i agree with jeremy - why bother getting yourself in debt to the tune of half a million pounds to buy a modest house in london ?
prices are n't going to come down unless buyers finally decide enough is enough , and that 50-year mortgages are the stuff of sheer madness .
the whole thing is lunacy .
london simply is n't worth this kind of money .
i 'm currently renting in london , but when the time comes to buy i will wave farewell to the capital and it 's mad property prices and move back to my native north-east , where prices are at least vaguely sensible and i can be sure i 'm getting some kind of value for money .
paul , uk well done adrian !
if more people stuck to their guns like you we would n't have such over inflated house prices .
carry on with what your doing and someone will crack in the end .
it 's time for buyers to realise that we control the market price and if you think its over priced do n't buy and do n't panic .
chris , uk just remember , all the talk about it being a buyers markets only serves to fuel the recent dips in house prices .
this is fine as a buyer in the short run , but remember , that housing prices will continue to fall over the longer term if attitudes / talk / media continue to depress them .
large mortgage with negative equity - not a great place to be chris , england with the same name as me i can empathise with the other adrian plant having recently moved for the seventh time .
you need to tell the estate agents what they need to do and if they fail you go direct to the client .
they will get the message eventually .the market will turn in your favour so be patient too .
adrian plant , uk it 's a pity you work in london .
living in north east scotland can be much better .
outside aberdeen you can get a very good house for £ 150,000 or less .
ok you may have to travel 20 miles to work , but it only takes half an hour , and the weather 's not as bad as you may think .
why spend all your money on a house ?
gordon duncan , scotland do you really want to live in london ? ? ?
there are so many nice places around the world where you can spend your money better .
good luck !
paolo , italy i sympathise with you - as a prospective first time buyer in edinburgh i am no further forward than i was over a year ago .
everyone tells me it will happen eventually and that " if it 's meant for you it will not go by you " so keep trying !
angela curran , scotland i agree with jeremy , go back to spain and avoid overcrowded , over-priced and over-rated london .
matt , uk do as thousands of sensible people have done over the past few years - move out of the south east . £ 200k buys you a decent 4 bedroom family home in far more desirable areas of the country -lrb- e.g. cheshire -rrb- than london or its surrounding counties .
people in the south east will realise the true " benefits " of their grossly over-inflated house prices -lrb- and really how well off they are -rrb- when they ca n't educate their children -lrb- no teachers available - even in private schools -rrb- , ca n't find a doctor , have long waiting lists for surgery , ca n't obtain repairs on their houses -lrb- no real tradesmen -rrb- etc etc rising house prices are causing real damage to the country and to our citizens standard of living .
estate agents and solicitors are the few genuine benefactors of over inflated prices .
len powell -lrb- dr -rrb- len , uk do n't believe that prices in london are suddenly going to fall drastically , leaving you and other buyers in a better position .
the london situation remains the same ... that for the majority of mid-range buyers , there are simply not enough properties to go round .
there are simply not enough homes for the number of people joining the property market each year , so modest and mid range properties will continue to sell for inflated prices and we just have to accept it .
trying to ' drive a hard bargain ' or ' wait for the market to fall ' will only result in disappointment ...
chris souvlis , uk i am in the middle of purchasing a property at this moment .
it has been a complete nightmare .
the thing that has struck me is that if we had the scottish system of house buying i would have had no problems what so ever .
why ca n't we adopt their way ?
i have had to endure people putting in offers not just on my property but others in ' the chain ' and then withdraw just before exchange .
i have felt powerless and depressed by the whole experience .
someone needs to do something it 's a joke .
the only people who win at the end are the solicitors who get paid even if there is no sale .
enough is enough , if i move i will never put myself through this again .
lauren hopcutt , england will people stop bashing solicitors ?
nick , uk do n't think it 's over when you finally find a house and have an offer accepted- then the fun really begins with the chain dilemmas !
we made an offer in on a house in april , it was accepted the next day but seven months later the chain of nine buyers / sellers had n't been complete .
the chain feel through 3 times .
just as it began to look promising , our vendor then upped the price by £ 15 , 000 !
needless to say we , withdrew , found another house and made a conditional offer based on it being chain free .
good luck jacqueline bloomfield , uk bide your time and do n't over-commit yourself .
in most areas of england today , house prices are running way ahead of average salaries , making a mockery of the property market vested interest view that housing is still " affordable " .
when interest rates eventually go up , today ¿ s buyers who have stretched themselves will suffer .
buyer beware is sound advice in today ¿ s property market .
martin , uk consider the possibility of a company transfer to america .
my house was $ 85,000 .
for that i got 2,500 square feet -lrb- 3 times the size of my parents house in england -rrb- , basement , 2 car garage .
steve , usa -lrb- ex uk -rrb- i have just come back from london , and what you get for £ 400,000 is rubbish .
in wales you can get a nice house for £ 90,000 , good job , and a lot less traffic .
i can not see why people tie themselves down to a tiny flat costing nearly half a million pounds .
the rest of the country is laughing at londoners , the place is rubbish , traffic nearly worst in the world , high prices everywhere .
i would never live there , even if prices of homes were £ 20,000 .
ian griffiths , south wales i 'm in same situation as adrian as a first time buyer looking in greater london since september .
i have viewed countless properties but my gut feeling is they are simply not worth the hefty price tag despite the agent 's best sales pitch .
i have now taken the decision to continue renting for another year and only buy if and when some sensibility returns to the market .
if not i will simply relocate to somewhere that gives me real value for money .
david , uk build yourself a new home instead .
one in 10 new homes are self-built and for a fraction of the cost .
you do n't have to deal with pesky estate agents and you get to design the house of your dreams .
ricky , uk the insane house price bubble is about to burst .
i currently rent and after reading many articles suggesting that ' buy-to-rent ' people are now struggling to find tenants i asked for a £ 200 / month reduction in my rent for the coming year , the agency agreed immediately ! ! !
i think i 'll just sit tight in my cheap but very well appointed rented accommodation for now and buy a nice house in 18 months or so when house prices massively correct themselves .
james maddison , uk as a first time buyer who moved to scotland for the cheaper house prices , i must say i recommend adrian move here .
you can get a superb house in glasgow for £ 150,000 .
the buying and selling system is vastly superior and the cost of living is around 25 % cheaper .
this more than makes up for the lower wages .
we are planning to buy a 2 bed terrace flat and do it up , and i don ¿ t think it will cost us more than £ 70k .
now that ¿ s what i call a realistic starter home price .
richard muschamp , scotland living in london has very few benefits !
for some time i commuted from hertford shire .
i believed that moving to london would give me more time to myself .
however , all the time saved on commuting is now spent stuck in traffic ¿ or avoiding tube closures .
even a night out is infact more difficult now the tubes stop running at a ridiculously early hour and the night bus is not a comfortable journey .
compared to cities such as paris , sydney and of course barcelona out capital is a complete shambles !
what scares me is that we all know how awful transport and living costs are ¿ but we also know that it seems to be getting worse rather than better .
dawn , uk adrian , if you are looking to own your property long-term -lrb- i.e.5-10 years -rrb- then might i suggest pay a bit extra for a house that can be improved and extended to your own needs .
there will be a slight drop in london by as much as 10 % to 20 % but that would be it in the next 2-3 years .
thereafter it will resort to increase in growth .
the possibility of going into negative equity does depend on how much cash you put in but again that will only be for 2-3 years .
by 2020 -lrb- a long way a way -rrb- there will be an extra 5 million people so your property will always be a wise long term investment .
be realistic and always keep some money aside for a rainy day for the mortgage -lrb- say six months worth -rrb- .good luck .
bobby ghosh , uk make a written offer to the vendor via the agent , subject to survey and contract .
ask the agent to forward your offer to the vendor with his recommendation / opinion on your offer in writing offer and provide you with a copy of his letter to the vendor .
remember if it 's not written down it might not have happened .
make sure the agent works for his fee and the vendor is aware of your interest in the property .
best of luck .
david , uk will people stop bashing solicitors ?
they do far more work for far lower fees than estate agents and most high street lawyers earn less than plumbers or electricians yet work longer hours .
a good solicitor will save you far more than he costs you .
nick , uk how much is your time worth ?
i mean , how much do you really value your personal time ?
do you enjoy the delays and congestion on public transport ?
can you suffer the long daily commute , just for the chance to own your own slice of the ¿ country ¿ ?
long walks home from remote stations -lrb- return trip -rrb- .
the decision to purchase a property should be made with the view of how you value your life -lrb- style -rrb- present and future .
the whinge on london price increases is as old as the properties in the capital .
better to accept it , take a modest leap and be happy .
you 're worth it .
gerard , london my advice to adrian would be to rent for a while , i think everyone is talking down the market , and being realistic .
the wages in london just do not allow the average person a chance of getting on the ladder on their own .
as the need for single occupant dwellings is increasing , it makes getting the first step of the ladder even harder , if your on your own .
this is going to lead to a shortage of skilled professionals and the infrastructure of london and the south east is suffering .
brad cutter , london uk house price inflation has been greater in spain than in the uk over the last few years .
you are n't going to get value for money in barcelona or madrid relative to local wages either , so ignore the " go back to spain " posters .
they do n't know what they are talking about .
russ , uk i sympathise .
i moved back to the uk at the end of october 2002 after 18 years in asia to work in east anglia .
i will rent while it looks like property prices are likely to fall .
luckily i have the option of waiting as my family wo n't move here for some time due to school issues .
chris , uk as a first time buyer you have to be cautious , but do n't be under any illusions that prices will ' crash ' in london .
interest rates are low and the amount of good property actually available will always sustain the market to a certain degree .
furthermore , if prices dropped 10 % -20 % , speculators , etc. would possibly move in .
the key in uncertain times is to purchase in a ' good area ' , this should help protect you in the long run .
gary cox , london , uk i can fully empathise with adrian 's situation - canny estate agents , gazumping and the costs of hunting around etc etc .
we solved the problem by using a homesearch / aquisition agent - there are plenty in your part of the world - a relatively new industry but takes the pain away , that 's for sure , look in your yellow pages / internet or under ' relocation agents ' or homesearch .
we did and have never looked back .
g t leatherdale , uk a few words of advice : be patient , prices are falling and do n't be afraid to haggle .
use the net to help you during the initial searches , will help identify the state of the market !
