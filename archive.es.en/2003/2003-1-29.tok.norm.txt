confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help . on the surface , petra roth sees prosperity when she looks over the skyscraper-filled skyline of frankurt .
but that is only on the surface .
once she takes a deeper look , particularly at the city government 's budget , she sees something that resembles poverty .
" our budgetary situation is a catastrophe , " roth told reporters on monday .
and when she speaks of " we , " roth is talking not only about frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , but also about the state of city budgets across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra roth to sound the alarm about the state of affairs , roth issued an appeal for help to federal officials this week .
" without quick action by federal and state officials , we will soon have to bury the self-administration of german cities , " said roth , who issued her appeal in her function as president of the association of german cities .
anatomy of a crisis as part of the appeal , the association issued a number-filled analysis that detailed the funding woes that have been caused by a mix of tax law changes over the years and the country 's anemic economy : first , the total amount of revenues that flow from the cities ' primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 .
second , the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing - with increases totaling about 5 percent last year alone . third , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
but the crisis is nothing new to josef schmid , the city treasurer in the southern german city of schwäbisch hall .
since 2000 , schmid has watched the revenues generated by the trade tax drop nearly 74 percent in his city .
that is the second worst decrease experienced by a german city , according to the association .
" it is a really difficult situation , " schmid told dw-world on tuesday .
" you have to examine everything and ask : ' do you need this or do n't you need it ? "
as a result of this examination , city officials have taken emergency action to curb their expentitures .
in one action , they decided last year not to fill 120 jobs that became vacant , including 40 full-time positions .
they also jacked up the fees for city services .
monthly kindergarten fees were doubled to € 60 for a family 's first child , and cemetery fees were raised 60 percent .
but schmid said the end was not in sight .
" it remains difficult , " he said .
frankfurt faces fall in revenues roth , too , can tell a similar tale .
the amount of trade taxes frankfurt has had to turn over to federal authorities has tripled since 1992 to € 150 million , she said .
to ease the shorfall , roth is urging the federal government in berlin , which is encountering money troubles of its own , to allow the cities to keep an additional € 2.3 billion from the trade tax .
such an immediate injection of cash would allow cities to carry out much-needed improvements in their infrastructure , she said .
but a spokesman for german finance minister hans eichel said federal officials were unwilling to provide the assistance right now .
instead , they want to await the work of a commission that is to complete its work on a sweeping financial reform proposal for german cities this spring . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help . on the surface , petra roth sees prosperity when she looks over the skyscraper-filled skyline of frankurt .
but that is only on the surface .
once she takes a deeper look , particularly at the city government 's budget , she sees something that resembles poverty .
" our budgetary situation is a catastrophe , " roth told reporters on monday .
and when she speaks of " we , " roth is talking not only about frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , but also about the state of city budgets across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra roth to sound the alarm about the state of affairs , roth issued an appeal for help to federal officials this week .
" without quick action by federal and state officials , we will soon have to bury the self-administration of german cities , " said roth , who issued her appeal in her function as president of the association of german cities .
anatomy of a crisis as part of the appeal , the association issued a number-filled analysis that detailed the funding woes that have been caused by a mix of tax law changes over the years and the country 's anemic economy : first , the total amount of revenues that flow from the cities ' primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 .
second , the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing - with increases totaling about 5 percent last year alone . third , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
but the crisis is nothing new to josef schmid , the city treasurer in the southern german city of schwäbisch hall .
since 2000 , schmid has watched the revenues generated by the trade tax drop nearly 74 percent in his city .
that is the second worst decrease experienced by a german city , according to the association .
" it is a really difficult situation , " schmid told dw-world on tuesday .
" you have to examine everything and ask : ' do you need this or do n't you need it ? "
as a result of this examination , city officials have taken emergency action to curb their expentitures .
in one action , they decided last year not to fill 120 jobs that became vacant , including 40 full-time positions .
they also jacked up the fees for city services .
monthly kindergarten fees were doubled to € 60 for a family 's first child , and cemetery fees were raised 60 percent .
but schmid said the end was not in sight .
" it remains difficult , " he said .
frankfurt faces fall in revenues roth , too , can tell a similar tale .
the amount of trade taxes frankfurt has had to turn over to federal authorities has tripled since 1992 to € 150 million , she said .
to ease the shorfall , roth is urging the federal government in berlin , which is encountering money troubles of its own , to allow the cities to keep an additional € 2.3 billion from the trade tax .
such an immediate injection of cash would allow cities to carry out much-needed improvements in their infrastructure , she said .

confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help . on the surface , petra roth sees prosperity when she looks over the skyscraper-filled skyline of frankurt .
but that is only on the surface .
once she takes a deeper look , particularly at the city government 's budget , she sees something that resembles poverty .
" our budgetary situation is a catastrophe , " roth told reporters on monday .
and when she speaks of " we , " roth is talking not only about frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , but also about the state of city budgets across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra roth to sound the alarm about the state of affairs , roth issued an appeal for help to federal officials this week .
" without quick action by federal and state officials , we will soon have to bury the self-administration of german cities , " said roth , who issued her appeal in her function as president of the association of german cities .
anatomy of a crisis as part of the appeal , the association issued a number-filled analysis that detailed the funding woes that have been caused by a mix of tax law changes over the years and the country 's anemic economy : first , the total amount of revenues that flow from the cities ' primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra roth to sound the alarm about the state of affairs , roth issued an appeal for help to federal officials this week .
" without quick action by federal and state officials , we will soon have to bury the self-administration of german cities , " said roth , who issued her appeal in her function as president of the association of german cities .
anatomy of a crisis as part of the appeal , the association issued a number-filled analysis that detailed the funding woes that have been caused by a mix of tax law changes over the years and the country 's anemic economy : first , the total amount of revenues that flow from the cities ' primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 .
second , the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing - with increases totaling about 5 percent last year alone . third , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
but the crisis is nothing new to josef schmid , the city treasurer in the southern german city of schwäbisch hall .
since 2000 , schmid has watched the revenues generated by the trade tax drop nearly 74 percent in his city .
that is the second worst decrease experienced by a german city , according to the association .
" it is a really difficult situation , " schmid told dw-world on tuesday .
" you have to examine everything and ask : ' do you need this or do n't you need it ? "
as a result of this examination , city officials have taken emergency action to curb their expentitures .
in one action , they decided last year not to fill 120 jobs that became vacant , including 40 full-time positions .
they also jacked up the fees for city services .
monthly kindergarten fees were doubled to € 60 for a family 's first child , and cemetery fees were raised 60 percent .
but schmid said the end was not in sight .
" it remains difficult , " he said .
frankfurt faces fall in revenues roth , too , can tell a similar tale .
the amount of trade taxes frankfurt has had to turn over to federal authorities has tripled since 1992 to € 150 million , she said .
to ease the shorfall , roth is urging the federal government in berlin , which is encountering money troubles of its own , to allow the cities to keep an additional € 2.3 billion from the trade tax .
such an immediate injection of cash would allow cities to carry out much-needed improvements in their infrastructure , she said .
but a spokesman for german finance minister hans eichel said federal officials were unwilling to provide the assistance right now .

confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help . on the surface , petra roth sees prosperity when she looks over the skyscraper-filled skyline of frankurt .
but that is only on the surface .
once she takes a deeper look , particularly at the city government 's budget , she sees something that resembles poverty .
" our budgetary situation is a catastrophe , " roth told reporters on monday .
and when she speaks of " we , " roth is talking not only about frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , but also about the state of city budgets across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra roth to sound the alarm about the state of affairs , roth issued an appeal for help to federal officials this week .
" without quick action by federal and state officials , we will soon have to bury the self-administration of german cities , " said roth , who issued her appeal in her function as president of the association of german cities .
anatomy of a crisis as part of the appeal , the association issued a number-filled analysis that detailed the funding woes that have been caused by a mix of tax law changes over the years and the country 's anemic economy : first , the total amount of revenues that flow from the cities ' primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 .
second , the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing - with increases totaling about 5 percent last year alone . third , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
but the crisis is nothing new to josef schmid , the city treasurer in the southern german city of schwäbisch hall .
since 2000 , schmid has watched the revenues generated by the trade tax drop nearly 74 percent in his city .
that is the second worst decrease experienced by a german city , according to the association .
" it is a really difficult situation , " schmid told dw-world on tuesday .
" you have to examine everything and ask : ' do you need this or do n't you need it ? "
as a result of this examination , city officials have taken emergency action to curb their expentitures .
in one action , they decided last year not to fill 120 jobs that became vacant , including 40 full-time positions .
they also jacked up the fees for city services .
monthly kindergarten fees were doubled to € 60 for a family 's first child , and cemetery fees were raised 60 percent .
but schmid said the end was not in sight .
" it remains difficult , " he said .
frankfurt faces fall in revenues roth , too , can tell a similar tale .
the amount of trade taxes frankfurt has had to turn over to federal authorities has tripled since 1992 to € 150 million , she said .
to ease the shorfall , roth is urging the federal government in berlin , which is encountering money troubles of its own , to allow the cities to keep an additional € 2.3 billion from the trade tax .
such an immediate injection of cash would allow cities to carry out much-needed improvements in their infrastructure , she said .
but a spokesman for german finance minister hans eichel said federal officials were unwilling to provide the assistance right now .

confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help . on the surface , petra roth sees prosperity when she looks over the skyscraper-filled skyline of frankurt .
but that is only on the surface .
once she takes a deeper look , particularly at the city government 's budget , she sees something that resembles poverty .
" our budgetary situation is a catastrophe , " roth told reporters on monday .
and when she speaks of " we , " roth is talking not only about frankfurt , germany 's financial capital , but also about the state of city budgets across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petra roth to sound the alarm about the state of affairs , roth issued an appeal for help to federal officials this week .
" without quick action by federal and state officials , we will soon have to bury the self-administration of german cities , " said roth , who issued her appeal in her function as president of the association of german cities .
anatomy of a crisis as part of the appeal , the association issued a number-filled analysis that detailed the funding woes that have been caused by a mix of tax law changes over the years and the country 's anemic economy : first , the total amount of revenues that flow from the cities ' primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 .
second , the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing - with increases totaling about 5 percent last year alone . third , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
but the crisis is nothing new to josef schmid , the city treasurer in the southern german city of schwäbisch hall .
since 2000 , schmid has watched the revenues generated by the trade tax drop nearly 74 percent in his city .
that is the second worst decrease experienced by a german city , according to the association .
" it is a really difficult situation , " schmid told dw-world on tuesday .
" you have to examine everything and ask : ' do you need this or do n't you need it ? "
as a result of this examination , city officials have taken emergency action to curb their expentitures .
in one action , they decided last year not to fill 120 jobs that became vacant , including 40 full-time positions .
they also jacked up the fees for city services .
monthly kindergarten fees were doubled to € 60 for a family 's first child , and cemetery fees were raised 60 percent .
but schmid said the end was not in sight .
" it remains difficult , " he said .
frankfurt faces fall in revenues roth , too , can tell a similar tale .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- state of the union address : full text news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : americas news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help languages editions change to uk wednesday , 29 january , 2003 , 05:00 gmt state of the union address : full text bush : " call of history has come to the right country " mr speaker , vice president cheney , members of congress , distinguished guests , fellow citizens : this country has many challenges . we will not deny , we will not ignore , we will not pass along our problems to other congresses , to other presidents , and other generations ... we will confront them with focus , and clarity , and courage every year , by law and by custom , we meet here to consider the state of the union . this year , we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead .
you and i serve our country in a time of great consequence . during this session of congress , we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country ... and we have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease . we will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared ... and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the american people . domestic issues in all these days of promise and days of reckoning , we can be confident . in a whirlwind of change , and hope , and peril , our faith is sure , our resolve is firm , and our union is strong . this country has many challenges . we will not deny , we will not ignore , we will not pass along our problems to other congresses , to other presidents , and other generations . we will confront them with focus , and clarity , and courage .
during the last two years , we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together .
to lift the standards of our public schools , we achieved historic education reform - which must now be carried out in every school , and in every classroom , so that every child in america can read , and learn , and succeed in life . to protect our country , we reorganised our government and created the department of homeland security - which is mobilising against the threats of a new era . to bring our economy out of recession , we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation . to insist on integrity in american business , we passed tough reforms , and we are holding corporate criminals to account . some might call this a good record . i call it a good start . tonight i ask the house and senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens . our first goal is clear : we must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job . after recession , terrorist attacks , corporate scandals , and stock market declines , our economy is recovering - yet it is not growing fast enough , or strongly enough .
with unemployment rising , our nation needs more small businesses to open , more companies to invest and expand , more employers to put up the sign that says , " help wanted " .
economy jobs are created when the economy grows ; the economy grows when americans have more money to spend and invest ; and the best and fairest way to make sure americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place . the best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth and to show some spending discipline in washington dc i am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year . and under my plan , as soon as i have signed the bill , this extra money will start showing up in workers ' pay cheques . instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty , we should do it now . instead of slowly raising the child credit to a thousand dollars , we should send the cheques to american families now . this tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes - and it will help our economy immediately . ninety-two million americans will keep - this year - an average of almost $ 1,100 more of their own money . a family of four with an income of $ 40,000 would see their federal income taxes fall from $ 1,178 to $ 45 per year . and our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses . you , the congress , have already passed all these reductions , and promised them for future years . if this tax relief is good for americans three , or five , or seven years from now , it is even better for americans today . we also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws . it is fair to tax a company 's profits .
it is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits . to boost investor confidence , and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income , i ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends . lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand . more jobs mean more taxpayers - and higher revenues to our government . the best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth and to show some spending discipline in washington dc . we must work together to fund only our most important priorities . i will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by four percent next year - about as much as the average family 's income is expected to grow . and that is a good benchmark for us : federal spending should not rise any faster than the pay cheques of american families . a growing economy , and a focus on essential priorities , will also be crucial to the future of social security . as we continue to work together to keep social security sound and reliable , we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own .
healthcare our second goal is high quality , affordable health care for all americans . the american system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation - with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives . yet for many people , medical care costs too much - and many have no health coverage at all . these problems will not be solved with a nationalised health care system that dictates coverage and rations care . instead , we must work toward a system in which all americans have a good insurance policy ... choose their own doctors ... and seniors and low-income americans receive the help they need . instead of bureaucrats , and trial lawyers , and hmos -lsb- health maintenance organisations -rsb- , we must put doctors , and nurses , and patients back in charge of american medicine . health care reform must begin with medicare , because medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society . we must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in america . seniors happy with the current medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is . and just like you , the members of congress , members of your staffs , and other federal employees , all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs . my budget will commit an additional 400 billion dollars over the next decade to reform and strengthen medicare . leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening medicare - i urge the members of this new congress to act this year .
to improve our health care system , we must address one of the prime causes of higher costs - the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued . because of excessive litigation , everybody pays more for health care - and many parts of america are losing fine doctors . no one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit - and i urge the congress to pass medical liability reform . the environment our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country , while dramatically improving the environment .
in this century , the greatest environmental progress will come about , not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations , but through technology and innovation i have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation , to develop cleaner technology , and to produce more energy at home . i have sent you clear skies legislation that mandates a 70 % cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years . i have sent you a healthy forests initiative , to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities , kill wildlife , and burn away millions of acres of treasured forest . i urge you to pass these measures , for the good of both our environment and our economy . even more , i ask you to take a crucial step , and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined . in this century , the greatest environmental progress will come about , not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations , but through technology and innovation . tonight i am proposing $ 1.2bn in research funding so that america can lead the world in developing clean , hydrogen-powered automobiles .
a simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy , which can be used to power a car - producing only water , not exhaust fumes . with a new national commitment , our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom - so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen , and pollution-free . join me in this important innovation - to make our air significantly cleaner , and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy . america 's problems our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of america to the deepest problems of america . tonight i ask congress and the american people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens for so many in our country - the homeless , the fatherless , the addicted - the need is great . yet there is power - wonder-working power - in the goodness , and idealism , and faith of the american people . americans are doing the work of compassion every day - visiting prisoners , providing shelter for battered women , bringing companionship to lonely seniors . these good works deserve our praise ... they deserve our personal support ... and , when appropriate , they deserve the assistance of our government . i urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the citizen service act - to encourage acts of compassion that can transform america , one heart and one soul at a time . last year , i called on my fellow citizens to participate in the usa freedom corps , which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across america . tonight i ask congress and the american people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens - boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention ... and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad . i propose a $ 450m initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners . government will support the training and recruiting of mentors , yet it is the men and women of america who will fill the need . one mentor , one person , can change a life forever - and i urge you to be that one person .
another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs . addiction crowds out friendship , ambition , moral conviction , and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire . as a government , we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies , and reducing demand through anti-drug education programs . yet for those already addicted , the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives .
too many americans in search of treatment can not get it . so tonight i propose a new $ 600m program to help an additional 300,000 americans receive treatment over the next three years .
our nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work . one of them is found at the healing place church in baton rouge , louisiana . a man in the program said , " god does miracles in people 's lives , and you never think it could be you . "
tonight , let us bring to all americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope : the miracle of recovery is possible , and it could be you . by caring for children who need mentors , and for addicted men and women who need treatment , we are building a more welcoming society - a culture that values every life . and in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us . i ask you to protect infants at the very hour of birth , and end the practice of partial-birth abortion . and because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment , i ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning . foreign policy the qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in america also determine our conduct abroad . the american flag stands for more than our power and our interests . our founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity - the rights of every person and the possibilities of every life . this conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted , and defend the peace , and confound the designs of evil men . in afghanistan , we helped to liberate an oppressed people ... and we will continue helping them secure their country , rebuild their society , and educate all their children - boys and girls . in the middle east , we will continue to seek peace between a secure israel and a democratic palestine . across the earth , america is feeding the hungry ; more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the united states .
as our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer , we must also remember our calling , as a blessed country , to make this world better . aids today , on the continent of africa , nearly 30 million people have the aids virus - including three million children under the age of 15 . this nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature there are whole countries in africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection . more than four million require immediate drug treatment . yet across that continent , only 50,000 aids victims - only 50,000 - are receiving the medicine they need . because the aids diagnosis is considered a death sentence , many do not seek treatment . almost all who do are turned away . a doctor in rural south africa describes his frustration . he says , " we have no medicines ... many hospitals tell -lsb- people -rsb- , ' you 've got aids . we ca n't help you . go home and die . " '
in an age of miraculous medicines , no person should have to hear those words . aids can be prevented . anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years . and the cost of those drugs has dropped from $ 12,000 a year to under $ 300 a year - which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp . ladies and gentlemen , seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many . we have confronted , and will continue to confront , hiv / aids in our own country . and to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad , tonight i propose the emergency plan for aids relief - a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of africa . this comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new aids infections ... treat at least two million people with life-extending drugs ... and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from aids , and for children orphaned by aids . i ask the congress to commit $ 15bn over the next five years , including nearly $ 10bn in new money , to turn the tide against aids in the most afflicted nations of africa and the caribbean .
this nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature . war on terror and this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism . all told , more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries , and many others have met a different fate ... let 's put it this way , they are no longer a problem for the united states and our friends and allies there are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror . there is never a day when i do not learn of another threat , or receive reports of operations in progress , or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers . the war goes on , and we are winning . to date we have arrested , or otherwise dealt with , many key commanders of al-qaeda . they include a man who directed logistics and funding for the 11 september attacks ... the chief of al-qaeda operations in the persian gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in east africa and the uss cole ... an al-qaeda operations chief from south east asia ... a former director of al-qaeda 's training camps in afghanistan ... a key al-qaeda operative in europe ... and a major al-qaeda leader in yemen . all told , more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries . and many others have met a different fate . let 's put it this way , they are no longer a problem for the united states and our friends and allies .
we are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks . america and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the american embassy in yemen ... the american embassy in singapore ... a saudi military base ... and ships in the straits of hormuz , and the straits of gibraltar . we have broken al-qaeda cells in hamburg , and milan , and madrid , and london , and paris - as well as buffalo , new york .
we have the terrorists on the run , and we are keeping them on the run . one by one , the terrorists are learning the meaning of american justice .
homeland security as we fight this war , we will remember where it began - here , in our own country . this government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland . we have intensified security at the borders and ports of entry ... posted more than 50,000 newly trained federal screeners in airports ... begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox ... and are deploying the nation 's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack . and this year , for the first time , we are beginning to field a defence to protect this nation against ballistic missiles .
i thank the congress for supporting these measures .
i ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bio-terrorism , called project bioshield . the budget i send you will propose almost six billion dollars to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax , botulinum toxin , ebola , and plague . we must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons , and we must act before the dangers are upon us .
since 11 september , our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists . the fbi is improving its ability to analyze intelligence , and is transforming itself to meet new threats . and tonight , i am instructing the leaders of the fbi , central intelligence , homeland security , and the department of defense to develop a terrorist threat integration center , to merge and analyse all threat information in a single location . our government must have the very best information possible , and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens .
turning to iraq our war against terror is a contest of will , in which perseverance is power . once again , this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace , and a world of chaos and constant alarm in the ruins of two towers , at the western wall of the pentagon , on a field in pennsylvania , this nation made a pledge , and we renew that pledge tonight : whatever the duration of this struggle , and whatever the difficulties , we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men - free people will set the course of history . today , the gravest danger in the war on terror ... the gravest danger facing america and the world ... is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons . these regimes could use such weapons for blackmail , terror , and mass murder . they could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies , who would use them without the least hesitation . this threat is new ; america 's duty is familiar . throughout the 20th century , small groups of men seized control of great nations ... built armies and arsenals ... and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world . in each case , their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit . in each case , the ambitions of hitlerism , militarism , and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples , by the strength of great alliances , and by the might of the united states of america . now , in this century , the ideology of power and domination has appeared again , and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror . once again , this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace , and a world of chaos and constant alarm . once again , we are called to defend the safety of our people , and the hopes of all mankind . and we accept this responsibility . america is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers . iraqi oppression we have called on the united nations to fulfil its charter , and stand by its demand that iraq disarm .
all free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attack ... we are asking them to join us , and many are doing so ... yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others we are strongly supporting the international atomic energy agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world . we are working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former soviet union , and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction . in all of these efforts , however , america 's purpose is more than to follow a process - it is to achieve a result : the end of terrible threats to the civilized world .
all free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attack . we are asking them to join us , and many are doing so . yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others . whatever action is required , whenever action is necessary , i will defend the freedom and security of the american people . different threats require different strategies . other oppressive regimes in iran , we continue to see a government that represses its people , pursues weapons of mass destruction , and supports terror . we also see iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty , human rights , and democracy . iranians , like all people , have a right to choose their own government , and determine their own destiny - and the united states supports their aspirations to live in freedom .
on the korean peninsula , an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation . throughout the 1990s , the united states relied on a negotiated framework to keep north korea from gaining nuclear weapons . we now know that the regime was deceiving the world , and developing those weapons all along . and today the north korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions . america and the world will not be blackmailed .
america is working with the countries of the region - south korea , japan , china , and russia - to find a peaceful solution , and to show the north korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation , economic stagnation , and continued hardship . the north korean regime will find respect in the world , and revival for its people , only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions .
our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the korean peninsula , and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in iraq . iraq 's un defiance a brutal dictator , with a history of reckless aggression ... with ties to terrorism ... with great potential wealth ... will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the united states .
it is up to iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons ... lay those weapons out for the world to see ... and destroy them as directed ... nothing like this has happened twelve years ago , saddam hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost . to spare himself , he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction . for the next 12 years , he systematically violated that agreement . he pursued chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country . nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons - not economic sanctions , not isolation from the civilized world , not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities . almost three months ago , the united nations security council gave saddam hussein his final chance to disarm . he has shown instead his utter contempt for the united nations , and for the opinion of the world . the 108 un weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of california . the job of the inspectors is to verify that iraq 's regime is disarming . it is up to iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons ... lay those weapons out for the world to see ... and destroy them as directed . nothing like this has happened .
the united nations concluded in 1999 that saddam hussein had biological weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25,000 litres of anthrax - enough doses to kill several million people . he has not accounted for that material . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed it . the united nations concluded that saddam hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 litres of botulinum toxin - enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure . he has not accounted for that material . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed it . our intelligence officials estimate that saddam hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin , mustard , and vx nerve agent . in such quantities , these chemical agents also could kill untold thousands . he has not accounted for these materials . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them .
us intelligence indicates that saddam hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents . inspectors recently turned up 16 of them , despite iraq 's recent declaration denying their existence . saddam hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them . from three iraqi defectors we know that iraq , in the late 1990s , had several mobile biological weapons labs . these are designed to produce germ warfare agents , and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors . saddam hussein has not disclosed these facilities . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them . iraq 's deception the international atomic energy agency confirmed in the 1990s that saddam hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program , had a design for a nuclear weapon , and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb . with nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons , saddam hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the middle east , and create deadly havoc in the region the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminium tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production . saddam hussein has not credibly explained these activities . he clearly has much to hide . the dictator of iraq is not disarming . to the contrary , he is deceiving . from intelligence sources , we know , for instance , that thousands of iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the un inspectors - sanitizing inspection sites , and monitoring the inspectors themselves . iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses . iraq is blocking u-2 surveillance flights requested by the united nations . iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview . real scientists have been coached by iraqi officials on what to say . and intelligence sources indicate that saddam hussein has ordered that scientists who co-operate with un inspectors in disarming iraq will be killed , along with their families . year after year , saddam hussein has gone to elaborate lengths , spent enormous sums , taken great risks , to build and keep weapons of mass destruction - but why ? the only possible explanation , the only possible use he could have for those weapons , is to dominate , intimidate , or attack . with nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons , saddam hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the middle east , and create deadly havoc in the region . and this congress and the american people must recognise another threat . links to terror evidence from intelligence sources , secret communications , and statements by people now in custody , reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists , including members of al-qaeda . secretly , and without fingerprints , he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists , or help them develop their own . before 11 september 2001 , many in the world believed that saddam hussein could be contained . but chemical agents and lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained . imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons , and other plans - this time armed by saddam hussein . it would take just one vial , one canister , one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known . we will do everything in our power to make sure that day never comes . some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent . since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions , politely putting us on notice before they strike ? if this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge , all actions , all words , and all recriminations would come too late . trusting in the sanity and restraint of saddam hussein is not a strategy , and it is not an option . this dictator , who is assembling the world 's most dangerous weapons , has already used them on whole villages - leaving thousands of his own citizens dead , blind , or disfigured . iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained - by torturing children while their parents are made to watch . international human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of iraq : electric shock , burning with hot irons , dripping acid on the skin , mutilation with electric drills , cutting out tongues , and rape . if this is not evil , then evil has no meaning . liberating iraq 's people and tonight i have a message for the brave and oppressed people of iraq : your enemy is not surrounding your country - your enemy is ruling your country . and the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation .
the world has waited 12 years for iraq to disarm . america will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country , our friends , and our allies . the united states will ask the un security council to convene on 5 february to consider the facts of iraq 's ongoing defiance of the world . secretary of state -lsb- colin -rsb- powell will present information and intelligence about iraq 's illegal weapons programs ; its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors ; and its links to terrorist groups . we will consult , but let there be no misunderstanding : if saddam hussein does not fully disarm , for the safety of our people , and for the peace of the world , we will lead a coalition to disarm him . tonight i also have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace , members of the american armed forces : many of you are assembling in and near the middle east , and some crucial hours may lie ahead . in those hours , the success of our cause will depend on you . your training has prepared you . your honour will guide you . you believe in america , and america believes in you .
sending americans into battle is the most profound decision a president can make . the technologies of war have changed . the risks and suffering of war have not . for the brave americans who bear the risk , no victory is free from sorrow . this nation fights reluctantly , because we know the cost , and we dread the days of mourning that always come . ' we will prevail ' we seek peace .
we strive for peace . and sometimes peace must be defended . we go forward with confidence , because this call of history has come to the right country a future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all . if war is forced upon us , we will fight in a just cause and by just means - sparing , in every way we can , the innocent . and if war is forced upon us , we will fight with the full force and might of the united states military - and we will prevail . and as we and our coalition partners are doing in afghanistan , we will bring to the iraqi people food , and medicines , and supplies ... and freedom .
many challenges , abroad and at home , have arrived in a single season . in two years , america has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril ... from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes . and we go forward with confidence , because this call of history has come to the right country . americans are a resolute people , who have risen to every test of our time . adversity has revealed the character of our country , to the world , and to ourselves .
america is a strong nation , and honourable in the use of our strength . we exercise power without conquest , and sacrifice for the liberty of strangers . americans are a free people , who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation . the liberty we prize is not america 's gift to the world , it is god 's gift to humanity . we americans have faith in ourselves - but not in ourselves alone . we do not claim to know all the ways of providence , yet we can trust in them , placing our confidence in the loving god behind all of life , and all of history . may he guide us now , and may god continue to bless the united states of america .
thank you .

you and i serve our country in a time of great consequence . during this session of congress , we have the duty to reform domestic programs vital to our country ... and we have the opportunity to save millions of lives abroad from a terrible disease . we will work for a prosperity that is broadly shared ... and we will answer every danger and every enemy that threatens the american people . domestic issues in all these days of promise and days of reckoning , we can be confident . in a whirlwind of change , and hope , and peril , our faith is sure , our resolve is firm , and our union is strong . this country has many challenges . we will not deny , we will not ignore , we will not pass along our problems to other congresses , to other presidents , and other generations . we will confront them with focus , and clarity , and courage .
during the last two years , we have seen what can be accomplished when we work together .
to lift the standards of our public schools , we achieved historic education reform - which must now be carried out in every school , and in every classroom , so that every child in america can read , and learn , and succeed in life . to protect our country , we reorganised our government and created the department of homeland security - which is mobilising against the threats of a new era . to bring our economy out of recession , we delivered the largest tax relief in a generation . to insist on integrity in american business , we passed tough reforms , and we are holding corporate criminals to account . some might call this a good record . i call it a good start . tonight i ask the house and senate to join me in the next bold steps to serve our fellow citizens . our first goal is clear : we must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job . after recession , terrorist attacks , corporate scandals , and stock market declines , our economy is recovering - yet it is not growing fast enough , or strongly enough .
with unemployment rising , our nation needs more small businesses to open , more companies to invest and expand , more employers to put up the sign that says , " help wanted " .
economy jobs are created when the economy grows ; the economy grows when americans have more money to spend and invest ; and the best and fairest way to make sure americans have that money is not to tax it away in the first place . the best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth and to show some spending discipline in washington dc i am proposing that all the income tax reductions set for 2004 and 2006 be made permanent and effective this year . and under my plan , as soon as i have signed the bill , this extra money will start showing up in workers ' pay cheques . instead of gradually reducing the marriage penalty , we should do it now . instead of slowly raising the child credit to a thousand dollars , we should send the cheques to american families now . this tax relief is for everyone who pays income taxes - and it will help our economy immediately . ninety-two million americans will keep - this year - an average of almost $ 1,100 more of their own money . a family of four with an income of $ 40,000 would see their federal income taxes fall from $ 1,178 to $ 45 per year . and our plan will improve the bottom line for more than 23 million small businesses . you , the congress , have already passed all these reductions , and promised them for future years . if this tax relief is good for americans three , or five , or seven years from now , it is even better for americans today . we also strengthen the economy by treating investors equally in our tax laws . it is fair to tax a company 's profits .
it is not fair to again tax the shareholder on the same profits . to boost investor confidence , and to help the nearly 10 million seniors who receive dividend income , i ask you to end the unfair double taxation of dividends . lower taxes and greater investment will help this economy expand . more jobs mean more taxpayers - and higher revenues to our government . the best way to address the deficit and move toward a balanced budget is to encourage economic growth and to show some spending discipline in washington dc . we must work together to fund only our most important priorities . i will send you a budget that increases discretionary spending by four percent next year - about as much as the average family 's income is expected to grow . and that is a good benchmark for us : federal spending should not rise any faster than the pay cheques of american families . a growing economy , and a focus on essential priorities , will also be crucial to the future of social security . as we continue to work together to keep social security sound and reliable , we must offer younger workers a chance to invest in retirement accounts that they will control and they will own .
healthcare our second goal is high quality , affordable health care for all americans . the american system of medicine is a model of skill and innovation - with a pace of discovery that is adding good years to our lives . yet for many people , medical care costs too much - and many have no health coverage at all . these problems will not be solved with a nationalised health care system that dictates coverage and rations care . instead , we must work toward a system in which all americans have a good insurance policy ... choose their own doctors ... and seniors and low-income americans receive the help they need . instead of bureaucrats , and trial lawyers , and hmos -lsb- health maintenance organisations -rsb- , we must put doctors , and nurses , and patients back in charge of american medicine . health care reform must begin with medicare , because medicare is the binding commitment of a caring society . we must renew that commitment by giving seniors access to the preventive medicine and new drugs that are transforming health care in america . seniors happy with the current medicare system should be able to keep their coverage just the way it is . and just like you , the members of congress , members of your staffs , and other federal employees , all seniors should have the choice of a health care plan that provides prescription drugs . my budget will commit an additional 400 billion dollars over the next decade to reform and strengthen medicare . leaders of both political parties have talked for years about strengthening medicare - i urge the members of this new congress to act this year .
to improve our health care system , we must address one of the prime causes of higher costs - the constant threat that physicians and hospitals will be unfairly sued . because of excessive litigation , everybody pays more for health care - and many parts of america are losing fine doctors . no one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit - and i urge the congress to pass medical liability reform . the environment our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country , while dramatically improving the environment .
in this century , the greatest environmental progress will come about , not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations , but through technology and innovation i have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation , to develop cleaner technology , and to produce more energy at home . i have sent you clear skies legislation that mandates a 70 % cut in air pollution from power plants over the next 15 years . i have sent you a healthy forests initiative , to help prevent the catastrophic fires that devastate communities , kill wildlife , and burn away millions of acres of treasured forest . i urge you to pass these measures , for the good of both our environment and our economy . even more , i ask you to take a crucial step , and protect our environment in ways that generations before us could not have imagined . in this century , the greatest environmental progress will come about , not through endless lawsuits or command and control regulations , but through technology and innovation . tonight i am proposing $ 1.2bn in research funding so that america can lead the world in developing clean , hydrogen-powered automobiles .
a simple chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen generates energy , which can be used to power a car - producing only water , not exhaust fumes . with a new national commitment , our scientists and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from laboratory to showroom - so that the first car driven by a child born today could be powered by hydrogen , and pollution-free . join me in this important innovation - to make our air significantly cleaner , and our country much less dependent on foreign sources of energy . america 's problems our fourth goal is to apply the compassion of america to the deepest problems of america . tonight i ask congress and the american people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens for so many in our country - the homeless , the fatherless , the addicted - the need is great . yet there is power - wonder-working power - in the goodness , and idealism , and faith of the american people . americans are doing the work of compassion every day - visiting prisoners , providing shelter for battered women , bringing companionship to lonely seniors . these good works deserve our praise ... they deserve our personal support ... and , when appropriate , they deserve the assistance of our government . i urge you to pass both my faith-based initiative and the citizen service act - to encourage acts of compassion that can transform america , one heart and one soul at a time . last year , i called on my fellow citizens to participate in the usa freedom corps , which is enlisting tens of thousands of new volunteers across america . tonight i ask congress and the american people to focus the spirit of service and the resources of government on the needs of some of our most vulnerable citizens - boys and girls trying to grow up without guidance and attention ... and children who have to go through a prison gate to be hugged by their mom or dad . i propose a $ 450m initiative to bring mentors to more than a million disadvantaged junior high students and children of prisoners . government will support the training and recruiting of mentors , yet it is the men and women of america who will fill the need . one mentor , one person , can change a life forever - and i urge you to be that one person .
another cause of hopelessness is addiction to drugs . addiction crowds out friendship , ambition , moral conviction , and reduces all the richness of life to a single destructive desire . as a government , we are fighting illegal drugs by cutting off supplies , and reducing demand through anti-drug education programs . yet for those already addicted , the fight against drugs is a fight for their own lives .
too many americans in search of treatment can not get it . so tonight i propose a new $ 600m program to help an additional 300,000 americans receive treatment over the next three years .
our nation is blessed with recovery programs that do amazing work . one of them is found at the healing place church in baton rouge , louisiana . a man in the program said , " god does miracles in people 's lives , and you never think it could be you . "
tonight , let us bring to all americans who struggle with drug addiction this message of hope : the miracle of recovery is possible , and it could be you . by caring for children who need mentors , and for addicted men and women who need treatment , we are building a more welcoming society - a culture that values every life . and in this work we must not overlook the weakest among us . i ask you to protect infants at the very hour of birth , and end the practice of partial-birth abortion . and because no human life should be started or ended as the object of an experiment , i ask you to set a high standard for humanity and pass a law against all human cloning . foreign policy the qualities of courage and compassion that we strive for in america also determine our conduct abroad . the american flag stands for more than our power and our interests . our founders dedicated this country to the cause of human dignity - the rights of every person and the possibilities of every life . this conviction leads us into the world to help the afflicted , and defend the peace , and confound the designs of evil men . in afghanistan , we helped to liberate an oppressed people ... and we will continue helping them secure their country , rebuild their society , and educate all their children - boys and girls . in the middle east , we will continue to seek peace between a secure israel and a democratic palestine . across the earth , america is feeding the hungry ; more than 60 percent of international food aid comes as a gift from the people of the united states .
as our nation moves troops and builds alliances to make our world safer , we must also remember our calling , as a blessed country , to make this world better . aids today , on the continent of africa , nearly 30 million people have the aids virus - including three million children under the age of 15 . this nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature there are whole countries in africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection . more than four million require immediate drug treatment . yet across that continent , only 50,000 aids victims - only 50,000 - are receiving the medicine they need . because the aids diagnosis is considered a death sentence , many do not seek treatment . almost all who do are turned away . a doctor in rural south africa describes his frustration . he says , " we have no medicines ... many hospitals tell -lsb- people -rsb- , ' you 've got aids . we ca n't help you . go home and die . " '
in an age of miraculous medicines , no person should have to hear those words . aids can be prevented . anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years . and the cost of those drugs has dropped from $ 12,000 a year to under $ 300 a year - which places a tremendous possibility within our grasp . ladies and gentlemen , seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many . we have confronted , and will continue to confront , hiv / aids in our own country . and to meet a severe and urgent crisis abroad , tonight i propose the emergency plan for aids relief - a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of africa . this comprehensive plan will prevent seven million new aids infections ... treat at least two million people with life-extending drugs ... and provide humane care for millions of people suffering from aids , and for children orphaned by aids . i ask the congress to commit $ 15bn over the next five years , including nearly $ 10bn in new money , to turn the tide against aids in the most afflicted nations of africa and the caribbean .
this nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature . war on terror and this nation is leading the world in confronting and defeating the man-made evil of international terrorism . all told , more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries , and many others have met a different fate ... let 's put it this way , they are no longer a problem for the united states and our friends and allies there are days when our fellow citizens do not hear news about the war on terror . there is never a day when i do not learn of another threat , or receive reports of operations in progress , or give an order in this global war against a scattered network of killers . the war goes on , and we are winning . to date we have arrested , or otherwise dealt with , many key commanders of al-qaeda . they include a man who directed logistics and funding for the 11 september attacks ... the chief of al-qaeda operations in the persian gulf who planned the bombings of our embassies in east africa and the uss cole ... an al-qaeda operations chief from south east asia ... a former director of al-qaeda 's training camps in afghanistan ... a key al-qaeda operative in europe ... and a major al-qaeda leader in yemen . all told , more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries . and many others have met a different fate . let 's put it this way , they are no longer a problem for the united states and our friends and allies .
we are working closely with other nations to prevent further attacks . america and coalition countries have uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies targeting the american embassy in yemen ... the american embassy in singapore ... a saudi military base ... and ships in the straits of hormuz , and the straits of gibraltar . we have broken al-qaeda cells in hamburg , and milan , and madrid , and london , and paris - as well as buffalo , new york .
we have the terrorists on the run , and we are keeping them on the run . one by one , the terrorists are learning the meaning of american justice .
homeland security as we fight this war , we will remember where it began - here , in our own country . this government is taking unprecedented measures to protect our people and defend our homeland . we have intensified security at the borders and ports of entry ... posted more than 50,000 newly trained federal screeners in airports ... begun inoculating troops and first responders against smallpox ... and are deploying the nation 's first early warning network of sensors to detect biological attack . and this year , for the first time , we are beginning to field a defence to protect this nation against ballistic missiles .
i thank the congress for supporting these measures .
i ask you tonight to add to our future security with a major research and production effort to guard our people against bio-terrorism , called project bioshield . the budget i send you will propose almost six billion dollars to quickly make available effective vaccines and treatments against agents like anthrax , botulinum toxin , ebola , and plague . we must assume that our enemies would use these diseases as weapons , and we must act before the dangers are upon us .
since 11 september , our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have worked more closely than ever to track and disrupt the terrorists . the fbi is improving its ability to analyze intelligence , and is transforming itself to meet new threats . and tonight , i am instructing the leaders of the fbi , central intelligence , homeland security , and the department of defense to develop a terrorist threat integration center , to merge and analyse all threat information in a single location . our government must have the very best information possible , and we will use it to make sure the right people are in the right places to protect all our citizens .
turning to iraq our war against terror is a contest of will , in which perseverance is power . once again , this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace , and a world of chaos and constant alarm in the ruins of two towers , at the western wall of the pentagon , on a field in pennsylvania , this nation made a pledge , and we renew that pledge tonight : whatever the duration of this struggle , and whatever the difficulties , we will not permit the triumph of violence in the affairs of men - free people will set the course of history . today , the gravest danger in the war on terror ... the gravest danger facing america and the world ... is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons . these regimes could use such weapons for blackmail , terror , and mass murder . they could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies , who would use them without the least hesitation . this threat is new ; america 's duty is familiar . throughout the 20th century , small groups of men seized control of great nations ... built armies and arsenals ... and set out to dominate the weak and intimidate the world . in each case , their ambitions of cruelty and murder had no limit . in each case , the ambitions of hitlerism , militarism , and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples , by the strength of great alliances , and by the might of the united states of america . now , in this century , the ideology of power and domination has appeared again , and seeks to gain the ultimate weapons of terror . once again , this nation and all our friends are all that stand between a world at peace , and a world of chaos and constant alarm . once again , we are called to defend the safety of our people , and the hopes of all mankind . and we accept this responsibility . america is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers . iraqi oppression we have called on the united nations to fulfil its charter , and stand by its demand that iraq disarm .
all free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attack ... we are asking them to join us , and many are doing so ... yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others we are strongly supporting the international atomic energy agency in its mission to track and control nuclear materials around the world . we are working with other governments to secure nuclear materials in the former soviet union , and to strengthen global treaties banning the production and shipment of missile technologies and weapons of mass destruction . in all of these efforts , however , america 's purpose is more than to follow a process - it is to achieve a result : the end of terrible threats to the civilized world .
all free nations have a stake in preventing sudden and catastrophic attack . we are asking them to join us , and many are doing so . yet the course of this nation does not depend on the decisions of others . whatever action is required , whenever action is necessary , i will defend the freedom and security of the american people . different threats require different strategies . other oppressive regimes in iran , we continue to see a government that represses its people , pursues weapons of mass destruction , and supports terror . we also see iranian citizens risking intimidation and death as they speak out for liberty , human rights , and democracy . iranians , like all people , have a right to choose their own government , and determine their own destiny - and the united states supports their aspirations to live in freedom .
on the korean peninsula , an oppressive regime rules a people living in fear and starvation . throughout the 1990s , the united states relied on a negotiated framework to keep north korea from gaining nuclear weapons . we now know that the regime was deceiving the world , and developing those weapons all along . and today the north korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions . america and the world will not be blackmailed .
america is working with the countries of the region - south korea , japan , china , and russia - to find a peaceful solution , and to show the north korean government that nuclear weapons will bring only isolation , economic stagnation , and continued hardship . the north korean regime will find respect in the world , and revival for its people , only when it turns away from its nuclear ambitions .
our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the korean peninsula , and not allow an even greater threat to rise up in iraq . iraq 's un defiance a brutal dictator , with a history of reckless aggression ... with ties to terrorism ... with great potential wealth ... will not be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the united states .
it is up to iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons ... lay those weapons out for the world to see ... and destroy them as directed ... nothing like this has happened twelve years ago , saddam hussein faced the prospect of being the last casualty in a war he had started and lost . to spare himself , he agreed to disarm of all weapons of mass destruction . for the next 12 years , he systematically violated that agreement . he pursued chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons even while inspectors were in his country . nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these weapons - not economic sanctions , not isolation from the civilized world , not even cruise missile strikes on his military facilities . almost three months ago , the united nations security council gave saddam hussein his final chance to disarm . he has shown instead his utter contempt for the united nations , and for the opinion of the world . the 108 un weapons inspectors were not sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials across a country the size of california . the job of the inspectors is to verify that iraq 's regime is disarming . it is up to iraq to show exactly where it is hiding its banned weapons ... lay those weapons out for the world to see ... and destroy them as directed . nothing like this has happened .
the united nations concluded in 1999 that saddam hussein had biological weapons materials sufficient to produce over 25,000 litres of anthrax - enough doses to kill several million people . he has not accounted for that material . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed it . the united nations concluded that saddam hussein had materials sufficient to produce more than 38,000 litres of botulinum toxin - enough to subject millions of people to death by respiratory failure . he has not accounted for that material . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed it . our intelligence officials estimate that saddam hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin , mustard , and vx nerve agent . in such quantities , these chemical agents also could kill untold thousands . he has not accounted for these materials . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them .
us intelligence indicates that saddam hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents . inspectors recently turned up 16 of them , despite iraq 's recent declaration denying their existence . saddam hussein has not accounted for the remaining 29,984 of these prohibited munitions . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them . from three iraqi defectors we know that iraq , in the late 1990s , had several mobile biological weapons labs . these are designed to produce germ warfare agents , and can be moved from place to place to evade inspectors . saddam hussein has not disclosed these facilities . he has given no evidence that he has destroyed them . iraq 's deception the international atomic energy agency confirmed in the 1990s that saddam hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program , had a design for a nuclear weapon , and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for a bomb . with nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons , saddam hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the middle east , and create deadly havoc in the region the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminium tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production . saddam hussein has not credibly explained these activities . he clearly has much to hide . the dictator of iraq is not disarming . to the contrary , he is deceiving . from intelligence sources , we know , for instance , that thousands of iraqi security personnel are at work hiding documents and materials from the un inspectors - sanitizing inspection sites , and monitoring the inspectors themselves . iraqi officials accompany the inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses . iraq is blocking u-2 surveillance flights requested by the united nations . iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the scientists inspectors are supposed to interview . real scientists have been coached by iraqi officials on what to say . and intelligence sources indicate that saddam hussein has ordered that scientists who co-operate with un inspectors in disarming iraq will be killed , along with their families . year after year , saddam hussein has gone to elaborate lengths , spent enormous sums , taken great risks , to build and keep weapons of mass destruction - but why ? the only possible explanation , the only possible use he could have for those weapons , is to dominate , intimidate , or attack . with nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons , saddam hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the middle east , and create deadly havoc in the region . and this congress and the american people must recognise another threat . links to terror evidence from intelligence sources , secret communications , and statements by people now in custody , reveal that saddam hussein aids and protects terrorists , including members of al-qaeda . secretly , and without fingerprints , he could provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists , or help them develop their own . before 11 september 2001 , many in the world believed that saddam hussein could be contained . but chemical agents and lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are not easily contained . imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons , and other plans - this time armed by saddam hussein . it would take just one vial , one canister , one crate slipped into this country to bring a day of horror like none we have ever known . we will do everything in our power to make sure that day never comes . some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent . since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions , politely putting us on notice before they strike ? if this threat is permitted to fully and suddenly emerge , all actions , all words , and all recriminations would come too late . trusting in the sanity and restraint of saddam hussein is not a strategy , and it is not an option . this dictator , who is assembling the world 's most dangerous weapons , has already used them on whole villages - leaving thousands of his own citizens dead , blind , or disfigured . iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained - by torturing children while their parents are made to watch . international human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of iraq : electric shock , burning with hot irons , dripping acid on the skin , mutilation with electric drills , cutting out tongues , and rape . if this is not evil , then evil has no meaning . liberating iraq 's people and tonight i have a message for the brave and oppressed people of iraq : your enemy is not surrounding your country - your enemy is ruling your country . and the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation .
the world has waited 12 years for iraq to disarm . america will not accept a serious and mounting threat to our country , our friends , and our allies . the united states will ask the un security council to convene on 5 february to consider the facts of iraq 's ongoing defiance of the world . secretary of state -lsb- colin -rsb- powell will present information and intelligence about iraq 's illegal weapons programs ; its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors ; and its links to terrorist groups . we will consult , but let there be no misunderstanding : if saddam hussein does not fully disarm , for the safety of our people , and for the peace of the world , we will lead a coalition to disarm him . tonight i also have a message for the men and women who will keep the peace , members of the american armed forces : many of you are assembling in and near the middle east , and some crucial hours may lie ahead . in those hours , the success of our cause will depend on you . your training has prepared you . your honour will guide you . you believe in america , and america believes in you .
sending americans into battle is the most profound decision a president can make . the technologies of war have changed . the risks and suffering of war have not . for the brave americans who bear the risk , no victory is free from sorrow . this nation fights reluctantly , because we know the cost , and we dread the days of mourning that always come . ' we will prevail ' we seek peace .
we strive for peace . and sometimes peace must be defended . we go forward with confidence , because this call of history has come to the right country a future lived at the mercy of terrible threats is no peace at all . if war is forced upon us , we will fight in a just cause and by just means - sparing , in every way we can , the innocent . and if war is forced upon us , we will fight with the full force and might of the united states military - and we will prevail . and as we and our coalition partners are doing in afghanistan , we will bring to the iraqi people food , and medicines , and supplies ... and freedom .
many challenges , abroad and at home , have arrived in a single season . in two years , america has gone from a sense of invulnerability to an awareness of peril ... from bitter division in small matters to calm unity in great causes . and we go forward with confidence , because this call of history has come to the right country . americans are a resolute people , who have risen to every test of our time . adversity has revealed the character of our country , to the world , and to ourselves .
america is a strong nation , and honourable in the use of our strength . we exercise power without conquest , and sacrifice for the liberty of strangers . americans are a free people , who know that freedom is the right of every person and the future of every nation . the liberty we prize is not america 's gift to the world , it is god 's gift to humanity . we americans have faith in ourselves - but not in ourselves alone . we do not claim to know all the ways of providence , yet we can trust in them , placing our confidence in the loving god behind all of life , and all of history . may he guide us now , and may god continue to bless the united states of america .
thank you .

his aim in the state of the union speech was to remove doubts in the eyes of the american people about the evil nature of the iraqi regime and spell out the exact nature of the threat that it poses .
powell will present evidence to the un by repeatedly giving details of the weapons of mass destruction that iraq possessed , and the nature of the regime , he was confronting head-on the issue of evidence that has been continually raised in the debate so far - although without presenting any new facts .
these may come when the us lays out its full case against iraq before the security council , with officials hinting that new intelligence data will be released .
moral high ground more importantly , the president was also aiming at recapturing the moral high ground , with his assertion that " if this is not evil , then evil has no meaning " .
president bush 's speech at times had the fervour of a religious sermon .
" if war is forced upon us , we will fight in a just cause and by just means , " he said .
the weapons inspectors say there has not been full co-operation mr bush was also preparing the nation - and the armed forces - for war , outlining his role as commander-in-chief and his reluctance to send men and women into battle unless it was absolutely necessary .
in recent days , the democrats have rediscovered their voice of opposition by attacking the president for his tax plan and rush to war .
the president 's speech will have silenced some of the critics , but not all of them .
and the democrats ' response will depend in large part how the opinion polls judge the speech .
appeal to the nation mr bush was also prepared to appeal to the country on the domestic front , arguing that the nation should face its problems at home with the same moral fervour that it tackled its enemies abroad .
and mr bush was nothing if not adroit in stealing some of the democrats ' clothing , pledging new initiatives on everything from health care to hydrogen-powered cars to help the environment .
whether or not his proposals pass scrutiny - and whether they are affordable - he has put forward a vision of quiet determination that may well capture the imagination of the american people .
allies president bush 's speech was aimed at that domestic audience , and barely mentioned america 's allies , except to say that " we will consult , but let there be no misunderstanding .
if saddam hussein does not disarm , for the sake of the peace of the world , we will lead a coalition to disarm him " .
however , the process of consulting key allies is now about to begin .
on thursday the president will receive italy 's prime minister , silvio berlusconi .
on friday , mr bush will hold talks at camp david in the us with uk prime minister tony blair about their strategy .
and next week , colin powell will try to persuade members of the un security council of the case for action against iraq .
mr bush has made it clear that although he will consult with members of the international community , he will not wait for their judgement before making his decision .
there appears to be little time left to assemble additional members of the coalition of the willing . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's claire bolderson reports from washington " the state of the american nation is also challenged " key stories iraq war cry foreign reaction domestic boldness troubled economic plan $ 15bn aids pledge reference key points full text of speech state of union history looming war iraq in the dock public support declines us military build-up what does us want ?

an inquiry into the central line derailment on saturday at chancery lane tube station , in which 32 people were injured has begun by the health and safety executive .
the central and the waterloo and city lines are likely to stay closed until at least the end of the week , london underground said .
and commuters heading home on tuesday found the northbound victoria line was closed and eastbound piccadilly line services were disrupted .

a further 20 deep-lying stations are closed and services restricted at two stops because of safety concerns during the fire strike which ends on thursday at 0900 gmt .
the investigation into saturday 's derailment could take up to four weeks .
trains will not start running again until " detailed discussions " between the hse and lu have been carried out .
all 85 trains will be examined and the driver , control centre and maintenance staff will also be interviewed .
an estimated 600,000 passengers a day have been displaced by the closure of the central line - the longest on the tube network - and the waterloo and city line .
but mayor of london ken livingstone has refused to postpone his scheme to charge £ 5 to drive into central london until the tube is running at full capacity .
safety hotline at his weekly press conference on tuesday , he said the closure would not effect the start of congestion charging on 17 february .
he said the level of disruption caused by the derailment experience only proved how important it was to manage congestion properly .
mr livingstone , who is offering a confidential hotline for tube drivers to report safety concerns , said he would increase confidence in the network when he takes control of the underground .
he said : " i do n't think you can say to londoners they are safe on the underground , they take a risk every time they get on and that is a disgrace . "
there have been very few accidents on london underground in its 140-year history and tube managers insist their record is " second to none " . watch / listen on this story bbc london 's jon craig " the mayor was speaking publicly for the first time since saturday 's derailment . "

the reform of health care has been a political graveyard of many politicians , and almost brought the clinton presidency to an early close .
and the president 's plan to expand the economy through tax cuts during a period of rising deficits and recession will raise fears on wall street about the size of the deficit - and fears among democrats about pressure for spending cuts in many domestic programmes .
elderly americans have to pay for their medicines but mr bush clearly feels that , with the democrats off-balance after their unexpected mid-term election defeat in november , now is the time to press forward with his stalled agenda .
and he is hoping that by demonstrating to the american people that he understands their main worries , and is prepared to do something about them , he will lay the groundwork for his 2004 election campaign .
mr bush was also striking a balance , in his brand of " compassionate conservatism " , between the responsibilities of the government , for example for more health care , and the responsibilities of individuals , in working to help transform the lives of people suffering from addiction or loneliness .
risky strategy mr bush 's economic proposals - for acceleration of his earlier tax cuts , and the abolition of taxes on dividends - are highly partisan proposals which got little applause from the democrats listening to his speech .
and his own treasury secretary admitted that they are not designed to act so much as an immediate stimulus but as part of a plan for a long-term transformation of the tax system .
some republicans as well as democrats are arguing for a postponement of the dividend tax cut , in favour of more immediate measures .
and in embracing both tax cuts and health care reforms , the president has signalled that he is prepared to allow the budget deficit to grow sharply .
next week the president will release details of his budget plans for next year , which will show a deficit of nearly $ 300bn , close to the record deficit of $ 290bn in 1992 , and almost double last year 's deficit of $ 159bn .
budget director mitch daniels has said that the priorities will be increased spending on the new department of homeland security , which is expected to get an 8 % budget increase , and further money for the defence department , whose funding will rise by around 5 % - and perhaps more if there is a protracted war in iraq .
that will leave other domestic programmes with increases of less than 4 % , and government employees will have pay increases of only 2 % .
and those cutbacks will make it more difficult for the president to sell his tax package , with democrats sure to point out the disparity between tax cuts for the rich and budget cuts for the poor .
health care crisis the budget crisis has also limited the president 's options in regard to the reform of health care .
like president clinton , george w bush has admitted that " for many people , health are costs too much - and many have no coverage at all " .
but his health care reform proposals are a careful balancing act between the need to provide new benefits - notably for prescription drugs for senior citizens , at a cost of $ 400bn over 10 years - and the need to contain costs .
mr bush is taking a risk in requiring senior citizens to choice health maintenance organisations if they are get the new drug benefit .
many rural states which are strong supporters of mr bush do not offer such plans , and previous attempts to tempt the elderly to join such plans have ended in failure .
and he has little to offer those who are uninsured , other than reductions in medical malpractice lawsuits by reforming the law .
and as he moved to expand medicare , many of the budget-strapped states have moved to reduce eligibility for medicaid , the government programme that provides health care for the poor .
faith-based initiative mr bush also gave support , much of it indirect , for the other wing of his party , the christian conservatives .
his hope to expand his faith-based initiatives in welfare reform , drug treatment , and job creation , would give federal help to churches .
and his pledge to try and block partial-birth abortions and human cloning will also appeal to that audience .
but , with opinion sharply divided on these and other issues like affirmative action , the president has to move more cautiously - and probably through the courts - to achieve his objectives .
delicate balance despite his november mid-term electoral victory in congress , mr bush still faces difficulty in getting many of his proposals through the senate , which includes many moderates and many more opportunities for obstruction .
but that might not worry mr bush too much .
he would be able to satisfy his conservative supporters without offending the moderates he will need for re-election in 2004 .
but it still could be the economy that proves george w bush 's achilles heel if his tax-cutting plan does not deliver the growth he is hoping for .

seats in parliament likud 37 labour 19 shinui 15 shas 11 national union bloc 7 meretz 6 nat .
religious party 5 united torah judaism 5 hadash 4 balad 3 yisrael b 'aliyah 2 one nation 4 ra 'am 3 ale yarok 0 herut 0 source : provisional official result in a vote which produced the lowest turnout in israeli election history , likud captured 37 seats - almost doubling its representation in the knesset -lrb- parliament -rrb- .
the emphatically secular shinui party also did well , becoming the third largest grouping in parliament .
however the main opposition labour party suffered its worst ever election defeat , having failed to woo voters frustrated by continued palestinian suicide attacks .
party leader amram mitzna has ruled out joining a right-wing coalition .
palestinians have described the outcome as counter to the interests of peace , and warned their situation was likely to deteriorate further .
' unity government ' addressing a crowd of cheering supporters in tel aviv in the early hours of wednesday morning , mr sharon called for israelis to unite against external threats . "
it is no shame to be in the opposition , and i promise you that our time there will be short " labour leader amram mitzna " the differences between us are dwarfed by the murderous hatred of the terror organisations , " he said .
he added that differences " should not become a barrier for national unity " , and called on zionist parties to aid the formation of a " unity government " .
but mr mitzna remained defiant , saying the labour party wanted to replace mr sharon not join him .
" politics are a marathon , and we are only in the first few kilometres , " he said as he acknowledged defeat .
" it is no shame to be in the opposition , and i promise you that our time there will be short . "
and the centrist shinui party further complicated matters when its leader , yosef ' tommy ' lapid , said that it would only join a coalition in which right-wing religious parties were not represented .
political horse-trading the crushing blow inflicted on israel 's left-wing parties contrasted with the successes of centrist and right-wing parties , with centrist , secular shinui party surpassing the ultra-orthodox shas party to become the new third-largest party , taking 15 seats in the 120-member knesset .
the leader of the dovish meretz party , yossi sarid , resigned after early exit polls showed his party had lost four seats .
although the results represent a victory for mr sharon , he now faces a period of political horse-trading as he attempts to build a coalition government .
the israeli leader may have to lead a coalition comprising right-wing and religious parties such as shas , which won 11 seats .
correspondents say such a narrow coalition would inhibit mr sharon 's ability to make concessions to the palestinians and would likely be short-lived .
palestinians dismay palestinian officials voiced disappointment with the results .
" this is a heavy blow to a peaceful settlement .
the israelis have committed an historic mistake which they and the palestinians will regret , " said palestinian information minister yasser abed rabbo .
israeli election officials said turnout among voters was the lowest in the state 's 55-year history , with 69 % of the 4.7 million-strong electorate participating .

prison officers ' association chairman finlay spratt said officers who thought they qualified had now been refused because their current addresses did not feature on the files .
" we settled this dispute but now they are weeding people out and refusing them , " he said .
" this is totally unacceptable and i can see us out protesting again . "
' turned down ' during past strike action , police officers were called in to staff the prisons .
it had been agreed all officers on the list could access one of three schemes to move house or install new home alarm systems .
finlay spratt : " about 150 have been turned down " however , mr spratt said many officers who thought they qualified were refused as their addresses did not feature on recovered files .
" about 150 have been turned down when we were assured everybody whose name was on the list was included , " he said .
" names , rank and place of work were included , so i do n't think it 's good enough to use the excuse that an address has not been compromised when that information is already known .
" the government is nit-picking and penny-pinching .
people were allowed to move and now they are coming back and saying ' you ca n't ' . "
a northern ireland prisons service spokeswoman said a final decision had not been made on every case .
" we have approved over 80 % of all applications to a range of schemes for staff whose details were compromised , " she said .
" a number of applications are still being considered . "
it is illegal for the officers to go on strike .
