program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution germany -pipe- 02.07.2003 germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already home to millions of immigrants and asylum seekers , germany is reluctant to hand power on immigration policy to brussels .
after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .
other european members of parliament in the convention have also made calls for more major changes - including dropping the veto on foreign policy .
britain , meanwhile , is concerned that eu member states would keep the right to veto decisions on tax policy .
the convention is set to meet on friday to make last adjustments to the draft , including finalizing the questions of whether the eu should drop national vetoes on foreign policy , defense , taxation and cultural issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 german kebab company plans döner domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a fast food outlet near you - wherever you may be .
the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

under the provisions of an anti-terror law , the united states is cutting military aid to countries that back the international criminal court and are unwilling to grant immunity to americans . making good on its pledge to penalize countries that have signed up for the international criminal court but have failed to sign bilateral agreements giving americans immunity , the united states said tuesday it would cut military aid and training to at least 35 countries next year . among the countries hit by the decision are six eastern european states slated to join nato next year including bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia .
all have refused to support u.s. demands that american citizens be given immunity from the court . the deadline for concluding bilateral agreements with the u.s. ran out on tuesday .
state department spokesman richard boucher said the u.s. would cut aid to the countries in an effort to force them into agreements . " we 're not attempting to infringe upon the rights of countries that have decided to sign and implement the treaty involving the international criminal court and we ask that our right and our decision , our sovereignty in deciding not to be a party to that treaty , is similarly respected , " boucher told journalists , explaining the bush administration 's position . millions in cuts the state department said the cuts in military aid would not affect the countries until the next u.s. budget goes into effect in september .

however , the state department said it would not cut aid to current nato members and other close u.s. allies .
u.s. president george w. bush also issued waivers for 22 other countries that had signed but not yet ratified agreements . to date , 50 countries have signed bilateral agreements with the u.s. that promise not to extradite americans if they are indicted by the international criminal court .

under the provisions of an anti-terror law , the united states is cutting military aid to countries that back the international criminal court and are unwilling to grant immunity to americans . making good on its pledge to penalize countries that have signed up for the international criminal court but have failed to sign bilateral agreements giving americans immunity , the united states said tuesday it would cut military aid and training to at least 35 countries next year . among the countries hit by the decision are six eastern european states slated to join nato next year including bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia .
all have refused to support u.s. demands that american citizens be given immunity from the court . the deadline for concluding bilateral agreements with the u.s. ran out on tuesday .
state department spokesman richard boucher said the u.s. would cut aid to the countries in an effort to force them into agreements . " we 're not attempting to infringe upon the rights of countries that have decided to sign and implement the treaty involving the international criminal court and we ask that our right and our decision , our sovereignty in deciding not to be a party to that treaty , is similarly respected , " boucher told journalists , explaining the bush administration 's position . millions in cuts the state department said the cuts in military aid would not affect the countries until the next u.s. budget goes into effect in september .
for the months between september and december , a total of $ 47.6 million is expected to be withheld .
normally , the monies are used for weapons and equipment purchases , education and training . the american servicemembers ' protection act recently passed by congress requires that military aid be cut to all countries that refuse to support the immunity of americans from prosecution by the new court .
however , the state department said it would not cut aid to current nato members and other close u.s. allies .
u.s. president george w. bush also issued waivers for 22 other countries that had signed but not yet ratified agreements . to date , 50 countries have signed bilateral agreements with the u.s. that promise not to extradite americans if they are indicted by the international criminal court . " mean spirited " human rights organizations have criticized the tactics used by the bush administration to secure bilateral agreements .

germany 's railway deutsche bahn has decided to reinstate the popular " bahn card " discount card , in an effort to boost flagging rail travel in germany .
a recent overhaul of the bahn ’ s price system has been a major flop . amid much fanfare in december 2002 , deutsche bahn rolled out a new pricing system aimed at filling empty seats . the system used yield management pricing methods similar to those of airlines . it gave big discounts to travelers who booked far in advance , as well as to families with young children . at the time , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn called the system “ clear and transparent , ” and said it was more logical and intuitive than the “ tariff jungle ” that preceded it . “ rail travel for millions of people will be cheaper than ever , ” he said . but under the new system , last-minute ticket buying and late-date changes were strongly penalized .
at the same time , the bahn card formula was changed , costing less initially but offering only a 25 percent discount . only half a year later , the bahn was forced to admit the new system had been a colossal failure , as passengers fled the railways in droves .
in an effort to avoid further damage , mehdorn on wednesday announced the railway operator was re-tweaking the pricing system once again . new “ old ” discount while mehdorn had previously said he wouldn ’ t change the new pricing system for at least a year , he gave in to consumer pressure after a mere seven months , reinstating the “ old ” bahn card , which will now cost € 200 instead of € 140 and offers 50 percent discount . the new bahn card 25 - which costs an initial € 60 , offers only a 25 percent discount - will also be continued . pro bahn , a consumer group acting on behalf of train travelers , loudly cheered the reinstatement of the old bahn card .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 german kebab company plans döner domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a fast food outlet near you - wherever you may be .
the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .
if the environmentalists succeed , it could put an end to the production of the a380 super jumbo in finkenwerder altogether , leaving toulouse , france , as the exclusive assembly location .
but with whole portions of the facility already completed and full government support behind airbus , it is likely that after assembly begins on the first plane in august , the a380 will become an important symbol of hamburg 's economic might .
meanwhile , airbus 's finkenwerder plant has grown to become the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris air show highlights transatlantic tug of war the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .
both public and private funding are nowadays , sadly , increasingly hard to come by . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .
two months prior to that , a 22-year-old shot and killed three people and wounded one at his former voacational college .

after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 german kebab company plans döner domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a fast food outlet near you - wherever you may be .
the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .
if the environmentalists succeed , it could put an end to the production of the a380 super jumbo in finkenwerder altogether , leaving toulouse , france , as the exclusive assembly location .
but with whole portions of the facility already completed and full government support behind airbus , it is likely that after assembly begins on the first plane in august , the a380 will become an important symbol of hamburg 's economic might .
meanwhile , airbus 's finkenwerder plant has grown to become the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris air show highlights transatlantic tug of war the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "

airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 german kebab company plans döner domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a fast food outlet near you - wherever you may be .
the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.07.2003 economic crisis puts the squeeze on arts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin philharmonic , directed by sir simon rattle -lrb- shown here -rrb- , has turned itself into a public foundation , helping to shield it from money troubles .
in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .
both public and private funding are nowadays , sadly , increasingly hard to come by . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .

critics at home say the several conflicts of interests that have shadowed his political tenure make him unfit for office .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .

state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 german railway re-tweaks prices amid complaints großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the cards : germany 's railway chief hopes to make riders happy by bringing back old discounts .
germany 's railway deutsche bahn has decided to reinstate the popular " bahn card " discount card , in an effort to boost flagging rail travel in germany .
a recent overhaul of the bahn ’ s price system has been a major flop . amid much fanfare in december 2002 , deutsche bahn rolled out a new pricing system aimed at filling empty seats . the system used yield management pricing methods similar to those of airlines . it gave big discounts to travelers who booked far in advance , as well as to families with young children . at the time , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn called the system “ clear and transparent , ” and said it was more logical and intuitive than the “ tariff jungle ” that preceded it . “ rail travel for millions of people will be cheaper than ever , ” he said . but under the new system , last-minute ticket buying and late-date changes were strongly penalized .

under the provisions of an anti-terror law , the united states is cutting military aid to countries that back the international criminal court and are unwilling to grant immunity to americans . making good on its pledge to penalize countries that have signed up for the international criminal court but have failed to sign bilateral agreements giving americans immunity , the united states said tuesday it would cut military aid and training to at least 35 countries next year . among the countries hit by the decision are six eastern european states slated to join nato next year including bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia .
all have refused to support u.s. demands that american citizens be given immunity from the court . the deadline for concluding bilateral agreements with the u.s. ran out on tuesday .
state department spokesman richard boucher said the u.s. would cut aid to the countries in an effort to force them into agreements . " we 're not attempting to infringe upon the rights of countries that have decided to sign and implement the treaty involving the international criminal court and we ask that our right and our decision , our sovereignty in deciding not to be a party to that treaty , is similarly respected , " boucher told journalists , explaining the bush administration 's position . millions in cuts the state department said the cuts in military aid would not affect the countries until the next u.s. budget goes into effect in september .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution germany -pipe- 02.07.2003 germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already home to millions of immigrants and asylum seekers , germany is reluctant to hand power on immigration policy to brussels .
after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .
other european members of parliament in the convention have also made calls for more major changes - including dropping the veto on foreign policy .
britain , meanwhile , is concerned that eu member states would keep the right to veto decisions on tax policy .
the convention is set to meet on friday to make last adjustments to the draft , including finalizing the questions of whether the eu should drop national vetoes on foreign policy , defense , taxation and cultural issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution germany -pipe- 02.07.2003 germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already home to millions of immigrants and asylum seekers , germany is reluctant to hand power on immigration policy to brussels .
after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .

the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution germany -pipe- 02.07.2003 germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already home to millions of immigrants and asylum seekers , germany is reluctant to hand power on immigration policy to brussels .
after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .
other european members of parliament in the convention have also made calls for more major changes - including dropping the veto on foreign policy .
britain , meanwhile , is concerned that eu member states would keep the right to veto decisions on tax policy .
the convention is set to meet on friday to make last adjustments to the draft , including finalizing the questions of whether the eu should drop national vetoes on foreign policy , defense , taxation and cultural issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .
if the environmentalists succeed , it could put an end to the production of the a380 super jumbo in finkenwerder altogether , leaving toulouse , france , as the exclusive assembly location .
but with whole portions of the facility already completed and full government support behind airbus , it is likely that after assembly begins on the first plane in august , the a380 will become an important symbol of hamburg 's economic might .

cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .
if the environmentalists succeed , it could put an end to the production of the a380 super jumbo in finkenwerder altogether , leaving toulouse , france , as the exclusive assembly location .
but with whole portions of the facility already completed and full government support behind airbus , it is likely that after assembly begins on the first plane in august , the a380 will become an important symbol of hamburg 's economic might .
meanwhile , airbus 's finkenwerder plant has grown to become the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris air show highlights transatlantic tug of war the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states .

the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .

with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .

the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .

" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "

germany 's railway deutsche bahn has decided to reinstate the popular " bahn card " discount card , in an effort to boost flagging rail travel in germany .
a recent overhaul of the bahn ’ s price system has been a major flop . amid much fanfare in december 2002 , deutsche bahn rolled out a new pricing system aimed at filling empty seats . the system used yield management pricing methods similar to those of airlines . it gave big discounts to travelers who booked far in advance , as well as to families with young children . at the time , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn called the system “ clear and transparent , ” and said it was more logical and intuitive than the “ tariff jungle ” that preceded it . “ rail travel for millions of people will be cheaper than ever , ” he said . but under the new system , last-minute ticket buying and late-date changes were strongly penalized .
at the same time , the bahn card formula was changed , costing less initially but offering only a 25 percent discount . only half a year later , the bahn was forced to admit the new system had been a colossal failure , as passengers fled the railways in droves .
in an effort to avoid further damage , mehdorn on wednesday announced the railway operator was re-tweaking the pricing system once again . new “ old ” discount while mehdorn had previously said he wouldn ’ t change the new pricing system for at least a year , he gave in to consumer pressure after a mere seven months , reinstating the “ old ” bahn card , which will now cost € 200 instead of € 140 and offers 50 percent discount . the new bahn card 25 - which costs an initial € 60 , offers only a 25 percent discount - will also be continued . pro bahn , a consumer group acting on behalf of train travelers , loudly cheered the reinstatement of the old bahn card .

a recent overhaul of the bahn ’ s price system has been a major flop . amid much fanfare in december 2002 , deutsche bahn rolled out a new pricing system aimed at filling empty seats . the system used yield management pricing methods similar to those of airlines . it gave big discounts to travelers who booked far in advance , as well as to families with young children . at the time , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn called the system “ clear and transparent , ” and said it was more logical and intuitive than the “ tariff jungle ” that preceded it . “ rail travel for millions of people will be cheaper than ever , ” he said . but under the new system , last-minute ticket buying and late-date changes were strongly penalized .
at the same time , the bahn card formula was changed , costing less initially but offering only a 25 percent discount . only half a year later , the bahn was forced to admit the new system had been a colossal failure , as passengers fled the railways in droves .
in an effort to avoid further damage , mehdorn on wednesday announced the railway operator was re-tweaking the pricing system once again . new “ old ” discount while mehdorn had previously said he wouldn ’ t change the new pricing system for at least a year , he gave in to consumer pressure after a mere seven months , reinstating the “ old ” bahn card , which will now cost € 200 instead of € 140 and offers 50 percent discount . the new bahn card 25 - which costs an initial € 60 , offers only a 25 percent discount - will also be continued . pro bahn , a consumer group acting on behalf of train travelers , loudly cheered the reinstatement of the old bahn card .
“ our group was bound and determined that the consumers using this means of price reduction shouldn ’ t be knocked around , ” spokesman rainer engel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn by reinstating the bahn card in its original form , mehdorn hopes to lure back frustrated passengers , who are increasingly fleeing train travel for alternatives such as discount airlines . too many empty seats the earlier-than-expected changes came as a result of steadily falling traffic figures . deutsche bahn lost 10.6 percent of its passengers in the first quarter of 2003 , with revenue from long-haul journeys down 14 percent . the lower numbers are due at least in part to the pricing changes , government statisticians said . for its part , however , the railway blames the unexpectedly low ridership on bad weather , the faltering economy , and a surge in low-cost airlines serving inter-german and other nearby european destinations . the fare changes come amid growing signs that mehdorn will have to postpone his ambitious plans to take deutsche bahn public in 2005 . behind closed doors , politicians expect the government , burned after its troublesome privatization experience with phone giant deutsche telekom , to delay any listing until at least early 2006 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism of new german train fares grows politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .
two months prior to that , a 22-year-old shot and killed three people and wounded one at his former voacational college .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .
two months prior to that , a 22-year-old shot and killed three people and wounded one at his former voacational college .

not so as italy took over on tuesday . since being elected italian prime minister in 2001 , many in europe have been uncomfortable with billionaire media baron-cum politician silvio berlusconi .
critics at home say the several conflicts of interests that have shadowed his political tenure make him unfit for office .
now the idea of having a man accused of dubious financial dealings and of bending the law to avoid prosecution on bribery charges is too much for some in europe . " berlusconi damages italy and now all of europe , he is corruption personified , " wrote michael müller , a senior leader of germany 's ruling social democratic party in an open letter to newspapers earlier this week .
" italy 's head of government is dismantling the independence of the courts , he 's custom tailoring laws to fit his needs , " he wrote , adding that berlusconi was also harming the media by mixing his own interests with those of the state .

whether it be italy 's resistance to a europe-wide arrest warrant or its demand that farmers be cut a special , unrelated deal before it signed on to an eu agreement that would eliminate tax evasion by people who hold money in secret foreign bank accounts , eu officials in brussels complain that italy has recently shown little willingness to compromise on important issues . rome has also been critical of the restrictive deficit-spending caps stipulated by the growth and stability pact ensuring the stability of the euro . the go-it-alone trend against brussels is aided little by flippant remarks made by berlusconi 's senior cabinet officials .
in response to the growing problem of illegal immigration from northern africa , umberto bossi , berlusconi 's flamboyant minister for reforms , said the country should call in the navy and fire on the boats to keep them from landing on italian shores . a hazy plan for the presidency little concrete will be known about italy 's plans for its eu presidency before wednesday , when berlusconi is expected to present his agenda before the european parliament in strasbourg .
but rome has said that opening the intergovernmental conference responsible for ushering through and approving a european constitution would be its highest priority .
approval of the successor to 1957 's treaty of rome , which created the european union , would be a nice feather in the cap for the italian presidency . illegal immigration and people trafficking is also expected to be a dominant issue .
italy has called for the creation of a joint european border guard to protect the mediterranean shores from illegal immigrants as well as controversial protection centers for immigrants outside the eu . it is also expected to give higher priority to promoting transatlantic relations and ties between europe , the mediterranean and the western balkans .
" europe must be complementary to the united states , " berlusconi recently told europe 1 radio .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .
two months prior to that , a 22-year-old shot and killed three people and wounded one at his former voacational college .

after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .
other european members of parliament in the convention have also made calls for more major changes - including dropping the veto on foreign policy .
britain , meanwhile , is concerned that eu member states would keep the right to veto decisions on tax policy .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .
both public and private funding are nowadays , sadly , increasingly hard to come by . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .

not so as italy took over on tuesday . since being elected italian prime minister in 2001 , many in europe have been uncomfortable with billionaire media baron-cum politician silvio berlusconi .
critics at home say the several conflicts of interests that have shadowed his political tenure make him unfit for office .
now the idea of having a man accused of dubious financial dealings and of bending the law to avoid prosecution on bribery charges is too much for some in europe .

whether it be italy 's resistance to a europe-wide arrest warrant or its demand that farmers be cut a special , unrelated deal before it signed on to an eu agreement that would eliminate tax evasion by people who hold money in secret foreign bank accounts , eu officials in brussels complain that italy has recently shown little willingness to compromise on important issues . rome has also been critical of the restrictive deficit-spending caps stipulated by the growth and stability pact ensuring the stability of the euro . the go-it-alone trend against brussels is aided little by flippant remarks made by berlusconi 's senior cabinet officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 hamburg readies for arrival of super jumbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's new mighty bird will take to the skies in 2006 .
but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .

airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .

the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .

not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .

the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution germany -pipe- 02.07.2003 germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already home to millions of immigrants and asylum seekers , germany is reluctant to hand power on immigration policy to brussels .
after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .
other european members of parliament in the convention have also made calls for more major changes - including dropping the veto on foreign policy .
britain , meanwhile , is concerned that eu member states would keep the right to veto decisions on tax policy .
the convention is set to meet on friday to make last adjustments to the draft , including finalizing the questions of whether the eu should drop national vetoes on foreign policy , defense , taxation and cultural issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .

about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .
other european members of parliament in the convention have also made calls for more major changes - including dropping the veto on foreign policy .
britain , meanwhile , is concerned that eu member states would keep the right to veto decisions on tax policy .
the convention is set to meet on friday to make last adjustments to the draft , including finalizing the questions of whether the eu should drop national vetoes on foreign policy , defense , taxation and cultural issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .
two months prior to that , a 22-year-old shot and killed three people and wounded one at his former voacational college .

under the provisions of an anti-terror law , the united states is cutting military aid to countries that back the international criminal court and are unwilling to grant immunity to americans . making good on its pledge to penalize countries that have signed up for the international criminal court but have failed to sign bilateral agreements giving americans immunity , the united states said tuesday it would cut military aid and training to at least 35 countries next year . among the countries hit by the decision are six eastern european states slated to join nato next year including bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia .
all have refused to support u.s. demands that american citizens be given immunity from the court . the deadline for concluding bilateral agreements with the u.s. ran out on tuesday .
state department spokesman richard boucher said the u.s. would cut aid to the countries in an effort to force them into agreements . " we 're not attempting to infringe upon the rights of countries that have decided to sign and implement the treaty involving the international criminal court and we ask that our right and our decision , our sovereignty in deciding not to be a party to that treaty , is similarly respected , " boucher told journalists , explaining the bush administration 's position . millions in cuts the state department said the cuts in military aid would not affect the countries until the next u.s. budget goes into effect in september .
for the months between september and december , a total of $ 47.6 million is expected to be withheld .
normally , the monies are used for weapons and equipment purchases , education and training . the american servicemembers ' protection act recently passed by congress requires that military aid be cut to all countries that refuse to support the immunity of americans from prosecution by the new court .
however , the state department said it would not cut aid to current nato members and other close u.s. allies .
u.s. president george w. bush also issued waivers for 22 other countries that had signed but not yet ratified agreements . to date , 50 countries have signed bilateral agreements with the u.s. that promise not to extradite americans if they are indicted by the international criminal court .

a recent overhaul of the bahn ’ s price system has been a major flop . amid much fanfare in december 2002 , deutsche bahn rolled out a new pricing system aimed at filling empty seats . the system used yield management pricing methods similar to those of airlines . it gave big discounts to travelers who booked far in advance , as well as to families with young children . at the time , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn called the system “ clear and transparent , ” and said it was more logical and intuitive than the “ tariff jungle ” that preceded it . “ rail travel for millions of people will be cheaper than ever , ” he said . but under the new system , last-minute ticket buying and late-date changes were strongly penalized .
at the same time , the bahn card formula was changed , costing less initially but offering only a 25 percent discount . only half a year later , the bahn was forced to admit the new system had been a colossal failure , as passengers fled the railways in droves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.07.2003 economic crisis puts the squeeze on arts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin philharmonic , directed by sir simon rattle -lrb- shown here -rrb- , has turned itself into a public foundation , helping to shield it from money troubles .
in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .

arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution germany -pipe- 02.07.2003 germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already home to millions of immigrants and asylum seekers , germany is reluctant to hand power on immigration policy to brussels .
after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .
other european members of parliament in the convention have also made calls for more major changes - including dropping the veto on foreign policy .
britain , meanwhile , is concerned that eu member states would keep the right to veto decisions on tax policy .
the convention is set to meet on friday to make last adjustments to the draft , including finalizing the questions of whether the eu should drop national vetoes on foreign policy , defense , taxation and cultural issues . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law on friday .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .
two months prior to that , a 22-year-old shot and killed three people and wounded one at his former voacational college .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .

the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 hamburg readies for arrival of super jumbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus 's new mighty bird will take to the skies in 2006 .
but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .
if the environmentalists succeed , it could put an end to the production of the a380 super jumbo in finkenwerder altogether , leaving toulouse , france , as the exclusive assembly location .
but with whole portions of the facility already completed and full government support behind airbus , it is likely that after assembly begins on the first plane in august , the a380 will become an important symbol of hamburg 's economic might .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .
if the environmentalists succeed , it could put an end to the production of the a380 super jumbo in finkenwerder altogether , leaving toulouse , france , as the exclusive assembly location .
but with whole portions of the facility already completed and full government support behind airbus , it is likely that after assembly begins on the first plane in august , the a380 will become an important symbol of hamburg 's economic might .
meanwhile , airbus 's finkenwerder plant has grown to become the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris air show highlights transatlantic tug of war the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states .

more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .
if the environmentalists succeed , it could put an end to the production of the a380 super jumbo in finkenwerder altogether , leaving toulouse , france , as the exclusive assembly location .
but with whole portions of the facility already completed and full government support behind airbus , it is likely that after assembly begins on the first plane in august , the a380 will become an important symbol of hamburg 's economic might .
meanwhile , airbus 's finkenwerder plant has grown to become the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris air show highlights transatlantic tug of war the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states .

whether it be italy 's resistance to a europe-wide arrest warrant or its demand that farmers be cut a special , unrelated deal before it signed on to an eu agreement that would eliminate tax evasion by people who hold money in secret foreign bank accounts , eu officials in brussels complain that italy has recently shown little willingness to compromise on important issues . rome has also been critical of the restrictive deficit-spending caps stipulated by the growth and stability pact ensuring the stability of the euro . the go-it-alone trend against brussels is aided little by flippant remarks made by berlusconi 's senior cabinet officials .
in response to the growing problem of illegal immigration from northern africa , umberto bossi , berlusconi 's flamboyant minister for reforms , said the country should call in the navy and fire on the boats to keep them from landing on italian shores . a hazy plan for the presidency little concrete will be known about italy 's plans for its eu presidency before wednesday , when berlusconi is expected to present his agenda before the european parliament in strasbourg .
but rome has said that opening the intergovernmental conference responsible for ushering through and approving a european constitution would be its highest priority .
approval of the successor to 1957 's treaty of rome , which created the european union , would be a nice feather in the cap for the italian presidency . illegal immigration and people trafficking is also expected to be a dominant issue .
italy has called for the creation of a joint european border guard to protect the mediterranean shores from illegal immigrants as well as controversial protection centers for immigrants outside the eu . it is also expected to give higher priority to promoting transatlantic relations and ties between europe , the mediterranean and the western balkans .
" europe must be complementary to the united states , " berlusconi recently told europe 1 radio .
" i think the west must be united .
there ca n't be competition between us and america . " as one of a group of eu leaders who supported u.s. president george w. bush during the iraq war , berlusconi is likely to find a more sympathetic ear in washington .
as for his critics , many are just buckling up their seat belts and hoping little will transpire during the next six months . " now we just have to be observant and hope that this time passes by quickly , without any further damage , " germany ’ s müller said on monday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does berlusconi mix state power with his own interests ?
the trial of italy 's prime minister comes under the scope of europe 's editorial pages - and most conclude that he 'll get off scott free - even if , as some papers allude , he deserves to be convicted .
-lrb- may 6 , 2003 -rrb- wave of immigrants laps at italy 's door as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean .
-lrb- june 24 , 2003 -rrb- the houdini of italian politics does it again brought before a milan court on corruption charges , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi managed to postpone his involvement in the case just a day before proceedings are due to be frozen by parliament .

under the provisions of an anti-terror law , the united states is cutting military aid to countries that back the international criminal court and are unwilling to grant immunity to americans . making good on its pledge to penalize countries that have signed up for the international criminal court but have failed to sign bilateral agreements giving americans immunity , the united states said tuesday it would cut military aid and training to at least 35 countries next year . among the countries hit by the decision are six eastern european states slated to join nato next year including bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia .
all have refused to support u.s. demands that american citizens be given immunity from the court . the deadline for concluding bilateral agreements with the u.s. ran out on tuesday .
state department spokesman richard boucher said the u.s. would cut aid to the countries in an effort to force them into agreements . " we 're not attempting to infringe upon the rights of countries that have decided to sign and implement the treaty involving the international criminal court and we ask that our right and our decision , our sovereignty in deciding not to be a party to that treaty , is similarly respected , " boucher told journalists , explaining the bush administration 's position . millions in cuts the state department said the cuts in military aid would not affect the countries until the next u.s. budget goes into effect in september .
for the months between september and december , a total of $ 47.6 million is expected to be withheld .
normally , the monies are used for weapons and equipment purchases , education and training . the american servicemembers ' protection act recently passed by congress requires that military aid be cut to all countries that refuse to support the immunity of americans from prosecution by the new court .
however , the state department said it would not cut aid to current nato members and other close u.s. allies .
u.s. president george w. bush also issued waivers for 22 other countries that had signed but not yet ratified agreements . to date , 50 countries have signed bilateral agreements with the u.s. that promise not to extradite americans if they are indicted by the international criminal court . " mean spirited " human rights organizations have criticized the tactics used by the bush administration to secure bilateral agreements . " u.s. ambassadors have been acting like schoolyard bullies , " said richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch .
" the u.s. campaign has not succeeded in undermining global support for the court .
but it has succeeded in making the u.s. government look foolish and mean-spirited . " despite heavy opposition from the united states , at least 90 nations have signed up to become members of the international criminal court in the hague , the netherlands , which was established to prosecute war crimes and other atrocities as a successor organization to the united nations war crimes tribunals .
the court began its work in earnest in this spring . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chief prosecutor joins war crimes court as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .

germany 's railway deutsche bahn has decided to reinstate the popular " bahn card " discount card , in an effort to boost flagging rail travel in germany .
a recent overhaul of the bahn ’ s price system has been a major flop . amid much fanfare in december 2002 , deutsche bahn rolled out a new pricing system aimed at filling empty seats . the system used yield management pricing methods similar to those of airlines . it gave big discounts to travelers who booked far in advance , as well as to families with young children . at the time , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn called the system “ clear and transparent , ” and said it was more logical and intuitive than the “ tariff jungle ” that preceded it . “ rail travel for millions of people will be cheaper than ever , ” he said . but under the new system , last-minute ticket buying and late-date changes were strongly penalized .
at the same time , the bahn card formula was changed , costing less initially but offering only a 25 percent discount . only half a year later , the bahn was forced to admit the new system had been a colossal failure , as passengers fled the railways in droves .
in an effort to avoid further damage , mehdorn on wednesday announced the railway operator was re-tweaking the pricing system once again . new “ old ” discount while mehdorn had previously said he wouldn ’ t change the new pricing system for at least a year , he gave in to consumer pressure after a mere seven months , reinstating the “ old ” bahn card , which will now cost € 200 instead of € 140 and offers 50 percent discount . the new bahn card 25 - which costs an initial € 60 , offers only a 25 percent discount - will also be continued . pro bahn , a consumer group acting on behalf of train travelers , loudly cheered the reinstatement of the old bahn card .

“ our group was bound and determined that the consumers using this means of price reduction shouldn ’ t be knocked around , ” spokesman rainer engel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn by reinstating the bahn card in its original form , mehdorn hopes to lure back frustrated passengers , who are increasingly fleeing train travel for alternatives such as discount airlines . too many empty seats the earlier-than-expected changes came as a result of steadily falling traffic figures . deutsche bahn lost 10.6 percent of its passengers in the first quarter of 2003 , with revenue from long-haul journeys down 14 percent . the lower numbers are due at least in part to the pricing changes , government statisticians said . for its part , however , the railway blames the unexpectedly low ridership on bad weather , the faltering economy , and a surge in low-cost airlines serving inter-german and other nearby european destinations . the fare changes come amid growing signs that mehdorn will have to postpone his ambitious plans to take deutsche bahn public in 2005 . behind closed doors , politicians expect the government , burned after its troublesome privatization experience with phone giant deutsche telekom , to delay any listing until at least early 2006 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism of new german train fares grows politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .
two months prior to that , a 22-year-old shot and killed three people and wounded one at his former voacational college .

continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .
both public and private funding are nowadays , sadly , increasingly hard to come by . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .

after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .
other european members of parliament in the convention have also made calls for more major changes - including dropping the veto on foreign policy .
britain , meanwhile , is concerned that eu member states would keep the right to veto decisions on tax policy .

after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .
about 154,500 foreigners were naturalized in germany in the course of 2002 .
the conservative opposition parties argue that immigration is too often a source of social conflict , that the interests of the german economic and labor market need to take priority , and that the asylum system is already swamped .
though cdu leader angela merkel has asked for the constitution 's immigration policy to include the right to veto , she has not threatened to block its ratification as her bavarian colleague edmund stoiber of the csu has done .
" eu majority voting will give asylum seekers access to labor markets through the back door , " the bavarian premier recently told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
" this is not acceptable from a german point of view .
all things unchanged , we will not approve this in the bundestag and bundesrat , " he said , referring to germany 's parliament and upper legislative chamber .
recently , the parties blocked the passage in the bundesrat of germany 's first-ever immigration policy , saying it would have opened the floodgates to foreign workers at a time when german unemployment is at a record high .
speaking at the final press conference on june 21 , chancellor schröder said the european union was not yet ready for a common immigration policy and that germany would only consider signing on to one if it could be assured that the " existing and ongoing burden " of immigration was shared across europe .
joschka fischer is not the only one calling for substantial changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.07.2003 economic crisis puts the squeeze on arts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin philharmonic , directed by sir simon rattle -lrb- shown here -rrb- , has turned itself into a public foundation , helping to shield it from money troubles .
in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .
both public and private funding are nowadays , sadly , increasingly hard to come by . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live arts.21 we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .

after initially supporting the european union 's draft constitution , the german government now says it is too early for a joint immigration policy and asks for a change in the draft constitution . german foreign minister joschka fischer , joined by two delegates at the convention drafting a constitution for europe , has appealed to convention president valery giscard d 'estaing to allow member states to veto immigration policies that would conflict with national interests .
the request , first published on tuesday by the berlin daily der tagesspiegel and later confirmed by the german foreign ministry , stated that immigration policy needed to remain in the hands of member states because " the issues raised by immigration policy are among the most sensitive areas of internal policy .
from germany 's point of view , a transition to majority decisions in this area is currently not acceptable . "
the draft constitution submitted to all member states at the thessaloniki summit in june foresees a common eu immigration policy .
but considerable domestic opposition has made it difficult for germany to transfer responsibility for immigration and asylum policy over to brussels .
split opinions at home the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have jointly contested the draft 's immigration provisions , which would enable decisions to be made in brussels by a majority vote .
germany has said member states alone should be responsible for determining how many non-eu immigrants can live and work in their country .
according to germany 's federal statistics office , from 1991 to 2001 , 8.6 million foreigners came to germany with the intention of staying not just for a short period of time .
among them , just under 1.9 million – that is about 22 percent of all foreigners – applied for asylum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 german kebab company plans döner domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a fast food outlet near you - wherever you may be .
the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

but construction in hamburg starts this august .
with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august . the buzz at the airbus plant in hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood is palpable .
one and a half years ago , this was one of the largest fresh-water mudflats in germany .
today , it 's a massive 140 hectare -lrb- 346 acre -rrb- sand landfill , complete with its own mini-saharan sand storms .
cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .
" our market research has shown that the asia-pacific region , especially , will be a growth market .
in that regard , it 's going to be a very important market for us – and we 'll be concentrating on this world region , " says benien .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus plant in hamburg-finkenwerder in recent months , airbus has shown great success in tapping that market .
the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .
airbus , meanwhile , is planning on adding 2,000 new jobs related to the a380 project at finkenwerder alone .
and that 's only part of the good news .
last month , it announced it had surpassed boeing for the number of passenger jets on order .
but that wo n't be enough to transform hamburg 's finkenwerder neighborhood into a german seattle overnight – there are still considerable hurdles to be cleared .
not in our backyard lawsuits for example , airbus is still at odds with neighbors in finkenwerder and the posh , villa-speckled hillsides of blankenese , just across the elbe river , over the extension of the plant 's runway .
local residents even purchased land from farmers to prevent airbus from expanding its production facilities or stretching its landing pad .
but the city-state is planning the passage of a new law that would ease airbus ' future expansion .
and german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will support legislation in the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , that would permit the government to expropriate private property for the benefit of corporate airports like the one maintained by airbus .
the battle with environmentalists over the filling of the mühlenberger loch also persists .
hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .
the plaintiffs are seeking a court ruling that would require airbus to halt construction and return the land to its original wetlands state .
environmentalists have argued that the wetland mudflats are an important station on migratory and breeding paths for volatile species of birds and fish along the elbe river .
" wetlands recovery would mean that the 170 hectare area would be reproduced in its original constitution , " said manfred braasch of the environmental and conservation group bund hamburg .
but a considerable amount of construction work has already been completed .
in may , chancellor schröder visited finkenwerder for the opening of the first production hangar , which measures an impressive 228 meters -lrb- 748 feet -rrb- long and 120 meters wide , roughly the length of two football fields .
if the environmentalists succeed , it could put an end to the production of the a380 super jumbo in finkenwerder altogether , leaving toulouse , france , as the exclusive assembly location .
but with whole portions of the facility already completed and full government support behind airbus , it is likely that after assembly begins on the first plane in august , the a380 will become an important symbol of hamburg 's economic might .
meanwhile , airbus 's finkenwerder plant has grown to become the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paris air show highlights transatlantic tug of war the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.07.2003 the eu presidency according to silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his court battles behind him , silvio berlusconi will now lead italy and europe for the next six months .
his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .
now silvio berlusconi is at the helm of europe and some fear scandal will overshadow his term as eu president . historically , the handover between european union presidencies has been a quiet affair . every six months a new country is placed at the helm of the rotating presidency , a largely symbolic office responsible for the organization and agenda-setting at major european summits .
not so as italy took over on tuesday . since being elected italian prime minister in 2001 , many in europe have been uncomfortable with billionaire media baron-cum politician silvio berlusconi .
critics at home say the several conflicts of interests that have shadowed his political tenure make him unfit for office .
now the idea of having a man accused of dubious financial dealings and of bending the law to avoid prosecution on bribery charges is too much for some in europe . " berlusconi damages italy and now all of europe , he is corruption personified , " wrote michael müller , a senior leader of germany 's ruling social democratic party in an open letter to newspapers earlier this week .
" italy 's head of government is dismantling the independence of the courts , he 's custom tailoring laws to fit his needs , " he wrote , adding that berlusconi was also harming the media by mixing his own interests with those of the state .
-lrb- as the owner of three mediaset stations and head of the government that manages the state-funded public broadcaster rai , berlusconi has either direct control or considerable influence on 90 percent of italy 's tv broadcasters . -rrb- " the godfather , " coming soon as he takes up the helm of the eu , europe ’ s media are also taking berlusconi to task .
he graces the cover of germany 's newsmagazine der spiegel this week , his headshot appearing over the headline : " the godfather : now appearing all across europe . "
the french newspaper le monde , meanwhile , predicts a difficult six months for berlusconi .
and only two years after it wrote that berlusconi was " unfit to rule italy , " the economist wrote recently that he was " unfit to rule europe . " the latest editorial tirades against berlusconi have been launched in the wake of a ruling on monday in a milan court that formally suspended a bribery trial against the italian prime minister after parliament passed a law last month granting immunity to sitting prime ministers .
the vote permitted berlusconi to neatly tie up any legal loose ends before assuming his role as eu president ; otherwise , his position would likely have embarrassed both italy and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to blame the bad press on the left-wing media in italy .
" the leftist italian press has been waging a war against me since i entered into politics , " he recently said . trepidation in brussels but criticism of berlusconi is n't isolated to the media - there 's also considerable concern he will bring too much political baggage with him as the symbolic head of the eu .
graham watson , head of the european parliament 's liberal democrats , said many europeans are shaken by the fact that the italian prime minister was able to change the law in order to avoid a conviction .
if italy were currently a candidate country for the european union , it probably would n't be granted admission , watson has argued . others have been critical of the policy course taken by berlusconi on pan-european issues , some even accusing it of having made a 180-degree u-turn .
whether it be italy 's resistance to a europe-wide arrest warrant or its demand that farmers be cut a special , unrelated deal before it signed on to an eu agreement that would eliminate tax evasion by people who hold money in secret foreign bank accounts , eu officials in brussels complain that italy has recently shown little willingness to compromise on important issues . rome has also been critical of the restrictive deficit-spending caps stipulated by the growth and stability pact ensuring the stability of the euro . the go-it-alone trend against brussels is aided little by flippant remarks made by berlusconi 's senior cabinet officials .
in response to the growing problem of illegal immigration from northern africa , umberto bossi , berlusconi 's flamboyant minister for reforms , said the country should call in the navy and fire on the boats to keep them from landing on italian shores . a hazy plan for the presidency little concrete will be known about italy 's plans for its eu presidency before wednesday , when berlusconi is expected to present his agenda before the european parliament in strasbourg .
but rome has said that opening the intergovernmental conference responsible for ushering through and approving a european constitution would be its highest priority .
approval of the successor to 1957 's treaty of rome , which created the european union , would be a nice feather in the cap for the italian presidency . illegal immigration and people trafficking is also expected to be a dominant issue .
italy has called for the creation of a joint european border guard to protect the mediterranean shores from illegal immigrants as well as controversial protection centers for immigrants outside the eu . it is also expected to give higher priority to promoting transatlantic relations and ties between europe , the mediterranean and the western balkans .
" europe must be complementary to the united states , " berlusconi recently told europe 1 radio .
" i think the west must be united .
there ca n't be competition between us and america . " as one of a group of eu leaders who supported u.s. president george w. bush during the iraq war , berlusconi is likely to find a more sympathetic ear in washington .
as for his critics , many are just buckling up their seat belts and hoping little will transpire during the next six months . " now we just have to be observant and hope that this time passes by quickly , without any further damage , " germany ’ s müller said on monday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does berlusconi mix state power with his own interests ?
the trial of italy 's prime minister comes under the scope of europe 's editorial pages - and most conclude that he 'll get off scott free - even if , as some papers allude , he deserves to be convicted .

germany 's railway deutsche bahn has decided to reinstate the popular " bahn card " discount card , in an effort to boost flagging rail travel in germany .
a recent overhaul of the bahn ’ s price system has been a major flop . amid much fanfare in december 2002 , deutsche bahn rolled out a new pricing system aimed at filling empty seats . the system used yield management pricing methods similar to those of airlines . it gave big discounts to travelers who booked far in advance , as well as to families with young children . at the time , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn called the system “ clear and transparent , ” and said it was more logical and intuitive than the “ tariff jungle ” that preceded it . “ rail travel for millions of people will be cheaper than ever , ” he said . but under the new system , last-minute ticket buying and late-date changes were strongly penalized .

germany 's railway deutsche bahn has decided to reinstate the popular " bahn card " discount card , in an effort to boost flagging rail travel in germany .
a recent overhaul of the bahn ’ s price system has been a major flop . amid much fanfare in december 2002 , deutsche bahn rolled out a new pricing system aimed at filling empty seats . the system used yield management pricing methods similar to those of airlines . it gave big discounts to travelers who booked far in advance , as well as to families with young children . at the time , deutsche bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn called the system “ clear and transparent , ” and said it was more logical and intuitive than the “ tariff jungle ” that preceded it . “ rail travel for millions of people will be cheaper than ever , ” he said . but under the new system , last-minute ticket buying and late-date changes were strongly penalized .
at the same time , the bahn card formula was changed , costing less initially but offering only a 25 percent discount . only half a year later , the bahn was forced to admit the new system had been a colossal failure , as passengers fled the railways in droves .
in an effort to avoid further damage , mehdorn on wednesday announced the railway operator was re-tweaking the pricing system once again . new “ old ” discount while mehdorn had previously said he wouldn ’ t change the new pricing system for at least a year , he gave in to consumer pressure after a mere seven months , reinstating the “ old ” bahn card , which will now cost € 200 instead of € 140 and offers 50 percent discount . the new bahn card 25 - which costs an initial € 60 , offers only a 25 percent discount - will also be continued . pro bahn , a consumer group acting on behalf of train travelers , loudly cheered the reinstatement of the old bahn card .
“ our group was bound and determined that the consumers using this means of price reduction shouldn ’ t be knocked around , ” spokesman rainer engel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn by reinstating the bahn card in its original form , mehdorn hopes to lure back frustrated passengers , who are increasingly fleeing train travel for alternatives such as discount airlines . too many empty seats the earlier-than-expected changes came as a result of steadily falling traffic figures . deutsche bahn lost 10.6 percent of its passengers in the first quarter of 2003 , with revenue from long-haul journeys down 14 percent . the lower numbers are due at least in part to the pricing changes , government statisticians said . for its part , however , the railway blames the unexpectedly low ridership on bad weather , the faltering economy , and a surge in low-cost airlines serving inter-german and other nearby european destinations . the fare changes come amid growing signs that mehdorn will have to postpone his ambitious plans to take deutsche bahn public in 2005 . behind closed doors , politicians expect the government , burned after its troublesome privatization experience with phone giant deutsche telekom , to delay any listing until at least early 2006 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism of new german train fares grows politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.07.2003 the eu presidency according to silvio großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his court battles behind him , silvio berlusconi will now lead italy and europe for the next six months .
his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .
now silvio berlusconi is at the helm of europe and some fear scandal will overshadow his term as eu president . historically , the handover between european union presidencies has been a quiet affair . every six months a new country is placed at the helm of the rotating presidency , a largely symbolic office responsible for the organization and agenda-setting at major european summits .
not so as italy took over on tuesday . since being elected italian prime minister in 2001 , many in europe have been uncomfortable with billionaire media baron-cum politician silvio berlusconi .
critics at home say the several conflicts of interests that have shadowed his political tenure make him unfit for office .
now the idea of having a man accused of dubious financial dealings and of bending the law to avoid prosecution on bribery charges is too much for some in europe . " berlusconi damages italy and now all of europe , he is corruption personified , " wrote michael müller , a senior leader of germany 's ruling social democratic party in an open letter to newspapers earlier this week .
" italy 's head of government is dismantling the independence of the courts , he 's custom tailoring laws to fit his needs , " he wrote , adding that berlusconi was also harming the media by mixing his own interests with those of the state .
-lrb- as the owner of three mediaset stations and head of the government that manages the state-funded public broadcaster rai , berlusconi has either direct control or considerable influence on 90 percent of italy 's tv broadcasters . -rrb- " the godfather , " coming soon as he takes up the helm of the eu , europe ’ s media are also taking berlusconi to task .
he graces the cover of germany 's newsmagazine der spiegel this week , his headshot appearing over the headline : " the godfather : now appearing all across europe . "
the french newspaper le monde , meanwhile , predicts a difficult six months for berlusconi .
and only two years after it wrote that berlusconi was " unfit to rule italy , " the economist wrote recently that he was " unfit to rule europe . " the latest editorial tirades against berlusconi have been launched in the wake of a ruling on monday in a milan court that formally suspended a bribery trial against the italian prime minister after parliament passed a law last month granting immunity to sitting prime ministers .
the vote permitted berlusconi to neatly tie up any legal loose ends before assuming his role as eu president ; otherwise , his position would likely have embarrassed both italy and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to blame the bad press on the left-wing media in italy .
" the leftist italian press has been waging a war against me since i entered into politics , " he recently said . trepidation in brussels but criticism of berlusconi is n't isolated to the media - there 's also considerable concern he will bring too much political baggage with him as the symbolic head of the eu .
graham watson , head of the european parliament 's liberal democrats , said many europeans are shaken by the fact that the italian prime minister was able to change the law in order to avoid a conviction .
if italy were currently a candidate country for the european union , it probably would n't be granted admission , watson has argued . others have been critical of the policy course taken by berlusconi on pan-european issues , some even accusing it of having made a 180-degree u-turn .
whether it be italy 's resistance to a europe-wide arrest warrant or its demand that farmers be cut a special , unrelated deal before it signed on to an eu agreement that would eliminate tax evasion by people who hold money in secret foreign bank accounts , eu officials in brussels complain that italy has recently shown little willingness to compromise on important issues . rome has also been critical of the restrictive deficit-spending caps stipulated by the growth and stability pact ensuring the stability of the euro . the go-it-alone trend against brussels is aided little by flippant remarks made by berlusconi 's senior cabinet officials .
in response to the growing problem of illegal immigration from northern africa , umberto bossi , berlusconi 's flamboyant minister for reforms , said the country should call in the navy and fire on the boats to keep them from landing on italian shores . a hazy plan for the presidency little concrete will be known about italy 's plans for its eu presidency before wednesday , when berlusconi is expected to present his agenda before the european parliament in strasbourg .
but rome has said that opening the intergovernmental conference responsible for ushering through and approving a european constitution would be its highest priority .
approval of the successor to 1957 's treaty of rome , which created the european union , would be a nice feather in the cap for the italian presidency . illegal immigration and people trafficking is also expected to be a dominant issue .
italy has called for the creation of a joint european border guard to protect the mediterranean shores from illegal immigrants as well as controversial protection centers for immigrants outside the eu . it is also expected to give higher priority to promoting transatlantic relations and ties between europe , the mediterranean and the western balkans .
" europe must be complementary to the united states , " berlusconi recently told europe 1 radio .
" i think the west must be united .
there ca n't be competition between us and america . " as one of a group of eu leaders who supported u.s. president george w. bush during the iraq war , berlusconi is likely to find a more sympathetic ear in washington .
as for his critics , many are just buckling up their seat belts and hoping little will transpire during the next six months . " now we just have to be observant and hope that this time passes by quickly , without any further damage , " germany ’ s müller said on monday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does berlusconi mix state power with his own interests ?
the trial of italy 's prime minister comes under the scope of europe 's editorial pages - and most conclude that he 'll get off scott free - even if , as some papers allude , he deserves to be convicted .
-lrb- may 6 , 2003 -rrb- wave of immigrants laps at italy 's door as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean .

cranes on the horizon are putting together the pieces of the massive hangars where the assembly of the company 's new super jumbo jet will commence in august .
the manufacture of airbus 's a380 is considered the most ambitious industrial project currently underway in germany .
the largest passenger jet in history , the a380 will carry over 500 passengers over distances as great as 16,000 kilometers -lrb- 9,942 miles -rrb- per flight .
by comparison , u.s. competitor boeing 's 747 jumbo jet can carry about 400 people , while traveling a maximum distance of 14,000 kilometers .
though the a380 has not yet been built , airbus executives are already rattling off superlatives and calling it the " flagship of the 21st century . "
when the first plane goes into service in 2006 , it will mark the first time airbus competes with boeing with a full fleet of aircraft – from small commuter-friendly jets to luxury wide-body jumbos for longer hauls .
the universal cockpit designs on many airbus planes means that pilots trained on one plane can fly on many others , reducing staff costs and adding to airbus ' attraction for airlines .
" a very important advantage of the a380 is it offers 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs for airlines than the biggest aircraft in use today , " says airbus spokesman theodor benien .
" it can also carry up to 550 passengers .
those are economic considerations that are very important for an airline . "
a multi-billion euro investment but those savings have come with considerable research and development costs .
airbus plans to spend a total of € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 13.5 billion -rrb- for the development of its super jumbo , including € 2.5 billion in government loans .
so far at least , its risk appears to be paying off .
despite the slump in air flight due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of a terrorist attack , the company has already booked 129 orders for the new jet , primarily from asia and the middle east .
most recently , at june 's paris air show , airbus announced orders from korean air and emirates for the a380 in deals totaling close to € 6.5 billion -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- .
airbus executives have projected that they must sell a minimum of 250 planes in order to make the expensive project pay off .

the company recently announced purchasing agreements for 81 airbus planes , totaling more than € 17.4 billion -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- , with pledged purchases of the a380 particularly strong .
the recent growth in sales represents a stark contrast to boeing , which in recent months has been forced to cut 30,000 jobs due to shrinking sales .

hamburg spent more than € 675 million to complete the landfill project , which eliminated 20 percent of the mudflats .
more than 200 lawsuits brought on by neighbors and environmental groups have been filed in court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.07.2003 german kebab company plans döner domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a fast food outlet near you - wherever you may be .
the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

under the provisions of an anti-terror law , the united states is cutting military aid to countries that back the international criminal court and are unwilling to grant immunity to americans . making good on its pledge to penalize countries that have signed up for the international criminal court but have failed to sign bilateral agreements giving americans immunity , the united states said tuesday it would cut military aid and training to at least 35 countries next year . among the countries hit by the decision are six eastern european states slated to join nato next year including bulgaria , estonia , latvia , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia .
all have refused to support u.s. demands that american citizens be given immunity from the court . the deadline for concluding bilateral agreements with the u.s. ran out on tuesday .
state department spokesman richard boucher said the u.s. would cut aid to the countries in an effort to force them into agreements . " we 're not attempting to infringe upon the rights of countries that have decided to sign and implement the treaty involving the international criminal court and we ask that our right and our decision , our sovereignty in deciding not to be a party to that treaty , is similarly respected , " boucher told journalists , explaining the bush administration 's position . millions in cuts the state department said the cuts in military aid would not affect the countries until the next u.s. budget goes into effect in september .
for the months between september and december , a total of $ 47.6 million is expected to be withheld .
normally , the monies are used for weapons and equipment purchases , education and training . the american servicemembers ' protection act recently passed by congress requires that military aid be cut to all countries that refuse to support the immunity of americans from prosecution by the new court .
however , the state department said it would not cut aid to current nato members and other close u.s. allies .
u.s. president george w. bush also issued waivers for 22 other countries that had signed but not yet ratified agreements . to date , 50 countries have signed bilateral agreements with the u.s. that promise not to extradite americans if they are indicted by the international criminal court . " mean spirited " human rights organizations have criticized the tactics used by the bush administration to secure bilateral agreements . " u.s. ambassadors have been acting like schoolyard bullies , " said richard dicker , director of the international justice program at human rights watch .
" the u.s. campaign has not succeeded in undermining global support for the court .
but it has succeeded in making the u.s. government look foolish and mean-spirited . " despite heavy opposition from the united states , at least 90 nations have signed up to become members of the international criminal court in the hague , the netherlands , which was established to prosecute war crimes and other atrocities as a successor organization to the united nations war crimes tribunals .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .
a police spokesperson said investigations had turned up evidence to suggest the pupil may have been interested in satanism , and went on to say that the two shotguns belonged to the pupil 's father .
coburg 's mayor norbert kastner described the family as a " traditional family of marksmen . "
the shooting in coburg is the latest in a series of similar incidents to have shaken germany in recent years . the country 's worst post-war shooting spree occurred in april 2002 , when a student returned to a high school he 'd recently been expelled from and killed 16 fellow students and teachers , before turning the gun on himself .
two months prior to that , a 22-year-old shot and killed three people and wounded one at his former voacational college .

the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience – courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier . it ’ s such a simple idea for a fast food meal .
grilled meat combined with salad and dressing in a lightly toasted bread pocket .
turkish in origin , the meat was traditionally served on a bed of rice .
but the döner bread sandwich common throughout germany was supposedly invented in berlin in the 1970s . far from being simply the staple diet of drunken hordes on their way home from sampling the local brew , the döner kebab has become big business in countries all over the world .
none more so than in germany , the country with the largest turkish population outside turkey itself .
a speciality of the land at the crossroads of europe and asia , the döner kebab is a symbol of the multi-cultural exchanges that have taken place in germany in the last 40 years . döner , by the way , comes from the turkish word “ döndurmek ” which roughly means “ it spins ” , in reference to the spinning vertical spits that the kebab meat is on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yummy , twenty per cent fat .
according to figures from the center for turkish studies in essen , there are over 400 hundred providers of kebab meat in germany , serving 12,000 outlets which in turn provide employment for 42,000 people . such is the demand for the humble kebab that the total number of outlets in germany have a combined turnover higher than that of mcdonalds , burger king and wienerwald , the german sausage vendor , put together .
the annual sales of döner kebabs in germany total almost € 1.5 billion with 720 million meat pockets sold every year . international reach one of the largest providers of all things döner is the karmez company , based in frankfurt .
with a yearly turnover of € 20 million and subsidiaries in paris , antwerp and barcelona , karmez provides the european kebab market with everything from aprons and masks to plastic table cloths and , of course , döner meat .
“ a good döner has a maximum of 20 percent fat , ” says enfil tütücünbasi , the sales manager for karmez .
each day , his company produces and sends out over 20 tons of said meat to europe ’ s vendors . tütücünbasi ’ s family came to germany in the 1970s and became involved in the business in the early 1980s , working in established kebab shops and delivering döner meat to vendors , supermarkets and restaurants .
that is , until enfil tütücünbasi ’ s brother came up with a great , yet simple , idea .
instead of delivering other people ’ s meat , they should produce and deliver their own .
the rest is fast food history . now the family business has turned into an international concern with 140 people working at their frankfurt base alone .
and the workforce is not only made up of turks .
“ we have a multi-cultural workforce , ” said önder tütücünbasi , the company ’ s director of finance .
two thirds come from turkey with the remainder coming from germany and other european countries , and some from as far away as africa . quality , diversity , innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " they ordered what ? "
karmez operates with a strategy of only three words , according to önder tütücünbasi : quality , diversity and innovation .
the quality of the company ’ s products does not seem to be in question .
for the past five years , karmez has been awarded the seal of approval by both the german agricultural society -lrb- dlg -rrb- and the central marketing association of german grocers -lrb- cma -rrb- . and in the areas of diversity and innovation , it seems that karmez and the family tütücünbasi are not ones to rest on their pita breads .
they plan to expand into serving canteens , catering firms and restaurants in an attempt to attract a new clientele .
there are even plans for a franchise network of their own outlets . with sales already outstripping their more global minded competitors in the fast food sector , karmez may be preparing to take its first steps towards döner domination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.07.2003 economic crisis puts the squeeze on arts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin philharmonic , directed by sir simon rattle -lrb- shown here -rrb- , has turned itself into a public foundation , helping to shield it from money troubles .
in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .
but they have more independence and flexibility , which allows them to react better to the market and decide how to spend their funds than if they were under closer government oversight .
and as a foundation , the philharmonic is free to take money from corporate sponsors .
for other berlin arts institutions , like the opera companies , this level of independence is enviable .
" as far as i know , other institutions which are still part of the berlin bureaucracy want to obtain this status , and there must be a certain rational for that , " dr. helge grünewald , the press spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told dw-world .
corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .
" if they back out , then you 'll have problems and no arts institution should find themselves in this position . "
the message : corporate funding is helpful and welcome , but not the end-all answer to the financial crisis .
both public and private funding are nowadays , sadly , increasingly hard to come by . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine . a fatal shooting at a school in the bavarian town of coburg left one dead and another injured . the event brings up memories of last year 's school shooting in erfurt . according to initial police reports , an eye witness reported that the 16-year-old pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , standing just a few meters in front of him .
unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as school counsellor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself .
the wounded teacher is being treated in a local hospital and her condition is not thought to be critical .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier , who immediately visited the scene of the crime , said at a press conference that the pupil was not considered an outsider and was expected to pass the year .
so far , details regarding his motive remain unclear .
according to hohlmeier , it 's believed the boy may have undergone recent upheavals in his personal life and that his academic performance suffered as a result .

his party changed the law to to make him immune from prosecution and his criminal case was dropped .
now silvio berlusconi is at the helm of europe and some fear scandal will overshadow his term as eu president . historically , the handover between european union presidencies has been a quiet affair . every six months a new country is placed at the helm of the rotating presidency , a largely symbolic office responsible for the organization and agenda-setting at major european summits .
not so as italy took over on tuesday . since being elected italian prime minister in 2001 , many in europe have been uncomfortable with billionaire media baron-cum politician silvio berlusconi .
critics at home say the several conflicts of interests that have shadowed his political tenure make him unfit for office .
now the idea of having a man accused of dubious financial dealings and of bending the law to avoid prosecution on bribery charges is too much for some in europe . " berlusconi damages italy and now all of europe , he is corruption personified , " wrote michael müller , a senior leader of germany 's ruling social democratic party in an open letter to newspapers earlier this week .
" italy 's head of government is dismantling the independence of the courts , he 's custom tailoring laws to fit his needs , " he wrote , adding that berlusconi was also harming the media by mixing his own interests with those of the state .
-lrb- as the owner of three mediaset stations and head of the government that manages the state-funded public broadcaster rai , berlusconi has either direct control or considerable influence on 90 percent of italy 's tv broadcasters . -rrb- " the godfather , " coming soon as he takes up the helm of the eu , europe ’ s media are also taking berlusconi to task .
he graces the cover of germany 's newsmagazine der spiegel this week , his headshot appearing over the headline : " the godfather : now appearing all across europe . "
the french newspaper le monde , meanwhile , predicts a difficult six months for berlusconi .
and only two years after it wrote that berlusconi was " unfit to rule italy , " the economist wrote recently that he was " unfit to rule europe . " the latest editorial tirades against berlusconi have been launched in the wake of a ruling on monday in a milan court that formally suspended a bribery trial against the italian prime minister after parliament passed a law last month granting immunity to sitting prime ministers .
the vote permitted berlusconi to neatly tie up any legal loose ends before assuming his role as eu president ; otherwise , his position would likely have embarrassed both italy and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi likes to blame the bad press on the left-wing media in italy .
" the leftist italian press has been waging a war against me since i entered into politics , " he recently said . trepidation in brussels but criticism of berlusconi is n't isolated to the media - there 's also considerable concern he will bring too much political baggage with him as the symbolic head of the eu .
graham watson , head of the european parliament 's liberal democrats , said many europeans are shaken by the fact that the italian prime minister was able to change the law in order to avoid a conviction .
if italy were currently a candidate country for the european union , it probably would n't be granted admission , watson has argued . others have been critical of the policy course taken by berlusconi on pan-european issues , some even accusing it of having made a 180-degree u-turn .
whether it be italy 's resistance to a europe-wide arrest warrant or its demand that farmers be cut a special , unrelated deal before it signed on to an eu agreement that would eliminate tax evasion by people who hold money in secret foreign bank accounts , eu officials in brussels complain that italy has recently shown little willingness to compromise on important issues . rome has also been critical of the restrictive deficit-spending caps stipulated by the growth and stability pact ensuring the stability of the euro . the go-it-alone trend against brussels is aided little by flippant remarks made by berlusconi 's senior cabinet officials .
in response to the growing problem of illegal immigration from northern africa , umberto bossi , berlusconi 's flamboyant minister for reforms , said the country should call in the navy and fire on the boats to keep them from landing on italian shores . a hazy plan for the presidency little concrete will be known about italy 's plans for its eu presidency before wednesday , when berlusconi is expected to present his agenda before the european parliament in strasbourg .
but rome has said that opening the intergovernmental conference responsible for ushering through and approving a european constitution would be its highest priority .
approval of the successor to 1957 's treaty of rome , which created the european union , would be a nice feather in the cap for the italian presidency . illegal immigration and people trafficking is also expected to be a dominant issue .
italy has called for the creation of a joint european border guard to protect the mediterranean shores from illegal immigrants as well as controversial protection centers for immigrants outside the eu . it is also expected to give higher priority to promoting transatlantic relations and ties between europe , the mediterranean and the western balkans .
" europe must be complementary to the united states , " berlusconi recently told europe 1 radio .
" i think the west must be united .
there ca n't be competition between us and america . " as one of a group of eu leaders who supported u.s. president george w. bush during the iraq war , berlusconi is likely to find a more sympathetic ear in washington .
as for his critics , many are just buckling up their seat belts and hoping little will transpire during the next six months .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .

the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .

corporate money , a knight in shining army ?
flexibility to manage one ’ s finances is one thing .
but should cultural institutions be so quick to turn to private and corporate funding to fill the gap left by declining government support ?
not necessarily .
in germany , sponsorship currently covers just four percent of arts funding -lrb- this is largely due to the fact that public investment is seven times higher in germany than in , say , england -rrb- .
that 's a lot of ground to cover with new corporate sponsorship in a country where arts administrators are not used to asking for hand-outs .
for one thing , the institutions lack the personal to do so .
at the london covent garden opera , a department of 27 people tend to fund-raising along with an additional 54 people in the marketing department .
that 's more than the entire administration of the bavarian state opera .
and if america is any kind of example , then corporate funding is every bit as vulnerable to the ups and downs of the market as government funding .
it , too , can dry up in times of crisis .
in the u.s. , total gifts by the nation ’ s top 60 donors fell from $ 12.7 billion in 2001 to $ 4.6 billion in 2002 , according to a survey by the chronicle for philanthropy .
rolf bolwin , director of the german stage association , has no illusions that private money will pick up the slack .
the german arts community has long cooperated with sponsors , but the contributions from private sources has remained modest , he observes .
over at the berlin philharmonic , dr. grünewald cautions arts institutions not to rely too heavily on sponsorship to cover the day-to-day costs of doing business .
surely the berlin philharmonic has benefited greatly from the support of deutsche bank , whose contributions are used for things like the educational program .
" if you have a sponsor , this sponsor should never contribute money to pay the salaries of the personal or cover the costs of running the institution - it should be used for special projects , " says dr. grünewald .

in times of economic crisis , money for culture is drying up .
european arts institutions are feeling the drought , but will private funding save the day ? it 's gone from boom to bust in the arts community .
the 90 's - a decade of almost unprecedented prosperity - saw a huge rise in arts funding the world over , with many a city and state budget devoting millions to the building of new concert halls and museums -lrb- designed by pricey big-name architects like frank gehry -rrb- .
but as corporate profits start hitting the skids and unemployment skyrockets , incredible-shrinking federal and state budgets are spoiling the convivial atmosphere .
arts institutions are under pressure .
where 's the money for cultural funding going to come from at a time when politicians are talking about slashing meat and potato benefits like health-care ?
as politicians in germany - and europe - struggle to find solutions to the budgetary crisis , they are turning their attention to private arts funding .
continental european cultural institutions have long been the benefactors of generous government support -lrb- either federal , state , or both -rrb- - unlike their counterparts in great britain and the united states .
but with less money to go around , will that continue to be the case ?
the situation in germany : the federal government to the rescue ?
do n't count on it .
because of germany 's federal structure , competencies are divided up between federal and state governments , with the latter responsible for culture -lrb- that 's why there 's no federal minister for culture in germany -rrb- .
state governments decide who - which museum , theater , orchestra - gets money and how much .
it 's no secret that state and local jurisdictions are in trouble - berlin , for example , is broke - but can arts institutions turn to the federal government to bail them out ?
not easily .
a federal cultural foundation was recently created , but came into conflict with the cultural foundation of the states , which was established over fifteen years ago .
attempts to unite the two , and thereby create one of the largest and most financially solvent cultural foundations in europe with a budget of € 46 million per year , have been plagued by prickly and , thus far , not entirely successful negotiations .
from public to private funding but while the german federal and state governments bicker , publicly-funded arts institutions throughout europe are thinking about how to cut costs , and whether they can offset sinking public funding with more private money .
they certainly do n't want to raise the cost of admission and drive away the public .
unlike the united states , where cultural institutions are used to dwindling state support -lrb- according to the national assembly of state arts agencies , 42 american states cut their arts budgets last year , with state arts funding decreasing from $ 410 million in 2001-02 to $ 310 million in 2002-2003 -rrb- , continental europe has enjoyed generous public funding .
but european governments are now taking a tougher stance , urging arts institutions to balance their budgets and increase profitability .
this has some european culture insiders worried that they could face the same fate as their counterparts across the pond and that they may therefore be forced to aggressively seek out more private funding and corporate sponsorship .
many wonder if the american-modeled option is the right answer to the budgetary crisis .
milan , giving private funding a try the world-famous milan-based scala opera house has for some time now - officially - been a semi-private foundation , though in actuality the personal costs are still covered by the state .
but a 1998 change in status allowed the opera house to seek more sponsorship money , without the conflicts faced by a publicly-funded institution .
complete renovation of the historic opera house , for example , has been completely financed by the italian tire manufacturer pirelli .
the scala itself is a world-wide recognized and esteemed " brand . "
large firms - so it would seem - are eager to associate themselves with such organizations , garnering a reputation as " supporters of excellence . "
berlin arts community , staying afloat in a troubled city the city-state of berlin is currently € 36 billion in dept , and this has no doubt taken its toll on the arts community .
recently , berlin 's culture senator thomas flierl announced a plan to reduce staff and jointly administer the city 's three opera houses , the staatsoper , the deutsche oper , and the komische oper .
under the plan , profitable opera houses , such as the staatsoper , which currently has a surplus of several million , would be required to fork over excess funds to bail out other ailing institutions , instead of re-investing it in their own house .
that 's the danger of coming under the umbrella of cultural institutions closely overseen by the government in a cash-strapped city .
berlin philharmonic , gaining financial independence the hugely popular berlin philharmonic , which signed sir simon rattle as its artistic director in 2001 , has managed to insulate itself from such fiscally and politically motivated moves and has attained a fair degree of independence in terms of how it handles its finances .
sir rattle made it a condition of his signing with the city , that the berlin philharmonic be turned into a public foundation , whereby it would become self-governing with the power to make artistic and financial decisions .
this required a change to state law , which was approved in 2001 .
the philharmonic gets a guaranteed allowance from the state , which is renegotiated every few years , and currently supports the philharmonic through 2004 .
of course , administrators at the philharmonic must make a case for this allowance , currently about € 14 million per year , and may face decreased funding should times turn bad .

they are the first boat people to have been stopped in australian waters since december 2001 .
they were detained by customs officers and will be transferred to christmas island to have their asylum claims processed .
a spokeswoman for the immigration department said she believed the boat was not part of a fresh wave of asylum seekers heading to australia .
' major failure ' the vessel , a fishing boat , was carrying about 50 men , women and children along with a baby .
it 's believed it had sailed within a few kilometres of the coast near the town of port hedland before it was spotted , having breached australia 's border security .
immigration officials have said they did know the boat was on its way from indonesia but had somehow lost track of it .
an internal review will try to find out why .
opposition politicians have described it as a " major failure in coastal surveillance " .
the immigration minister , philip ruddock , has refused to blame the navy or the coastguard .
he said it was often difficult to detect small boats in a " very large ocean " .
he also played downs suggestions that indonesia , with whom australia signed a deal in 1999 to try to prevent illegal migration , had failed to intercept the boat .
" i think it has to be seen as an isolated incident and certainly not a lack of cooperation on indonesia 's part , " said mr ruddock .
" they 've been very supportive of our regional efforts to combat people smuggling , " he added .
' immigration ' island these are the first asylum seekers to have made it so close to australia for 18 months .
the group will be taken to a detention centre on christmas island .
this remote territory in the indian ocean - about 1,800 kilometres from western australia - is part of a special immigration zone where those seeking asylum have fewer rights to apply for visas than on the mainland .
it also includes the ashmore and cartier islands in the timor sea , where many boatpeople have landed in the past .
these measures were designed to deter those planning to make the hazardous journey to australia from indonesia .
at least two other vessels carrying vietnamese asylum-seekers have attempted the crossing in recent months .
they were forced to abandon their trip when their boats threatened to sink .

from the chartist 's march of 1848 to cabbies ' fare protests in 2003 , suffragettes , cnd supporters , anti-apartheid campaigners and poll tax objectors have flocked to central london .
and the artistic merits of trafalgar square 's installations and spiralling costs , since it was first approved in 1826 , have ensured it remains as controversial as its protests .
while nelson 's column might be the its most recognisable feature , it was opposed by the square 's architect sir charles barry who thought it would dwarf its surroundings .
arguments over the column 's escalating costs prompted rows , refusals to pay and walkouts by contractors .
battles over what could , and could not , be installed in one of london 's most important urban squares continued into the 20th century . "
trafalgar square is so famous , no-one can agree on what is appropriate " prue leith , royal society of arts attempts to put statues of world war i admirals jellicoe and beatty on two plinths were fought off by the royal fine art commission , which thought they would upset the design of the square .
and more than 150 years after william wilkins 's designs for the national gallery were criticised as " weak " , prince charles used a 1984 speech to refer to the original modernist extension plans as a " monstrous carbuncle " .
ten years later the royal society of the arts -lrb- rsa -rrb- started putting forward proposals to finally fill the fourth plinth .
but within two years it had given up trying to find a permanent fixture because it was proving too controversial .
at a debate at the rsa in january 2000 , deputy chairwoman prue leith , recalled : " we thought it might be a good idea to fill the plinth .
" the trouble is that trafalgar square is so famous , no-one can agree on what is appropriate . "
although the problem was solved by using the plinth to display ever-changing pieces of modern art , the rows do not end there .
mr livingstone has recently waded into battle with westminster city council 's public art advisory committee over his plan to put a statue of nelson mandela on the newly-pedestrianised north terrace .
the committee thinks the bronze statue would be out of place because it is too big .
but mr livingstone has pledged to fight them all the way , ensuring battles of trafalgar square continue .

work is estimated to take up to five years to complete , opening up to the public a series of tunnels running around the castle for the first time in more than 50 years .
internationally-acclaimed stone masons have been drafted in to re-point the walls surrounding the castle - which include the remains of roman work .

we hope that 100 % of the tunnels will be open to the public " john edwards the castle 's wine cellar is planned to be opened to the public for the first time complete with the presses and vats which were last used to make cardiff castle wine in 1914 .
scaffolding has been erected around the exterior of the castle but a series of photographs featuring scenes from inside the house are planned to be hung on the outside of the castle walls .
john edwards , who is leading the project said the work was part of a long term strategy to preserve the castle .
sensitive " at the moment we are working on the masonry and have carried out detailed research over the last 18 months in order to make sure that the work is sensitive to the castle , " he said .
" we have consulted with international masonry experts for this phase of the work who are working here at the moment .
" we are going to be working on the tunnels which go right around the site .
" at the moment only about 15 % are open to the public , but we hope that 100 % will be open when the work is completed . "
shelters " they were last used as shelters during the war , " he added .
" we are also planning to open the wine cellars and who knows we may even start wine production again , " he joked .
as part of the restoration scheme , professor john ashurst and master mason colin burns are leading a team of skilled masons to work on the walls of the castle .
prof ashurst said : " this has to be one of the most interesting projects we have worked on . "
