berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .
" china is a nuclear state and has sufficient fissile material for its arms program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.12.2003 right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher 's brand of populist rhetoric has struck a nerve in switzerland .
when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .
he 's also announced he 'll be stepping down as chief executive of the swiss plastics and chemicals giant ems chemie , the company with which he made his fortune , by the end of the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election upsets traditional stability switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party -lrb- oct .

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.12.2003 right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher 's brand of populist rhetoric has struck a nerve in switzerland .
when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .
he 's also announced he 'll be stepping down as chief executive of the swiss plastics and chemicals giant ems chemie , the company with which he made his fortune , by the end of the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election upsets traditional stability switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party -lrb- oct .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .
" china is a nuclear state and has sufficient fissile material for its arms program .
so , why the controls ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.12.2003 right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher 's brand of populist rhetoric has struck a nerve in switzerland .
when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .
he 's also announced he 'll be stepping down as chief executive of the swiss plastics and chemicals giant ems chemie , the company with which he made his fortune , by the end of the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election upsets traditional stability switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party -lrb- oct .

in a special media partnership , deutsche welle is running a series of interviews in which leading experts of the united nations climate secretariat explain how global warming is affecting the planet and what can be done to combat climate change or least mitigate its effects .
the floods , droughts and fires which many experts attribute to global warming are leading to a large loss of human life every year and destroying or endangering the livelihood of many people .
climate change is also speeding up the extinction of the planet 's already dwindling animal and plant species .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the rapidly accelerating warming the world is now experiencing could trigger dramatic climatic changes across the entire planet which go beyond the loss of entire islands through rising sea levels .
these include the onset of a new ice age in the northern hemisphere , brought about by the shut-down of the gulf stream .
there is no longer a serious scientific debate as to whether global warming is taking place or not and whether or not it is being caused by humankind .

the international community took the first decisive steps to act against global warming at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 .
at the summit , it was agreed to establish the united nations climate convention , which in turn led to the development of the kyoto protocol .
the protocol was first drawn up in japan in 1997 and is designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
the kyoto agreement has yet to be ratified by enough industrialised countries to enter into force .
and it has been repudiated by the usa , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .

in a special media partnership , deutsche welle is running a series of interviews in which leading experts of the united nations climate secretariat explain how global warming is affecting the planet and what can be done to combat climate change or least mitigate its effects .
the floods , droughts and fires which many experts attribute to global warming are leading to a large loss of human life every year and destroying or endangering the livelihood of many people .
climate change is also speeding up the extinction of the planet 's already dwindling animal and plant species .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the rapidly accelerating warming the world is now experiencing could trigger dramatic climatic changes across the entire planet which go beyond the loss of entire islands through rising sea levels .
these include the onset of a new ice age in the northern hemisphere , brought about by the shut-down of the gulf stream .
there is no longer a serious scientific debate as to whether global warming is taking place or not and whether or not it is being caused by humankind .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change , made up of the world 's leading climate experts , has established this as a fact .
the international community took the first decisive steps to act against global warming at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 .
at the summit , it was agreed to establish the united nations climate convention , which in turn led to the development of the kyoto protocol .
the protocol was first drawn up in japan in 1997 and is designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
the kyoto agreement has yet to be ratified by enough industrialised countries to enter into force .
and it has been repudiated by the usa , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
however , many nongovernmental organisations and the united nations climate secretariat have managed to raise public awareness with regard to the issue in recent times .
in a special series of interviews , conducted with un experts , deutsche welle looks at issues such as emission trends , clean technologies and mobility and at what the world 's emerging economies are doing to adapt to the effects of climate change . dw-world.de the work of the un climate secretariat in bonn john hay from dw talked with joke waller-hunter , unfccc executive secretary , and asked her about her mission to persuade the international community of the need to act against global warming and the work of her organisation .

in a special media partnership , deutsche welle is running a series of interviews in which leading experts of the united nations climate secretariat explain how global warming is affecting the planet and what can be done to combat climate change or least mitigate its effects .
the floods , droughts and fires which many experts attribute to global warming are leading to a large loss of human life every year and destroying or endangering the livelihood of many people .
climate change is also speeding up the extinction of the planet 's already dwindling animal and plant species .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the rapidly accelerating warming the world is now experiencing could trigger dramatic climatic changes across the entire planet which go beyond the loss of entire islands through rising sea levels .
these include the onset of a new ice age in the northern hemisphere , brought about by the shut-down of the gulf stream .
there is no longer a serious scientific debate as to whether global warming is taking place or not and whether or not it is being caused by humankind .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change , made up of the world 's leading climate experts , has established this as a fact .
the international community took the first decisive steps to act against global warming at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 .
at the summit , it was agreed to establish the united nations climate convention , which in turn led to the development of the kyoto protocol .
the protocol was first drawn up in japan in 1997 and is designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
the kyoto agreement has yet to be ratified by enough industrialised countries to enter into force .
and it has been repudiated by the usa , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
however , many nongovernmental organisations and the united nations climate secretariat have managed to raise public awareness with regard to the issue in recent times .
in a special series of interviews , conducted with un experts , deutsche welle looks at issues such as emission trends , clean technologies and mobility and at what the world 's emerging economies are doing to adapt to the effects of climate change . dw-world.de the work of the un climate secretariat in bonn john hay from dw talked with joke waller-hunter , unfccc executive secretary , and asked her about her mission to persuade the international community of the need to act against global warming and the work of her organisation .
sustainable development as a tool to combat climate change john hay from dw talked to janos pasztor , coordinator of the unfccc ’ s sustainable development programme and asked him first about the potential india and other asian countries had to implement the type of clean technologies presented at the new delhi climate change technology bazaar .
greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions the unfccc implementation programme is responsible for gathering data concerning the amount of greenhouse gases emitted .
how intelligent transport policies can help stabilise emissions dw 's john hay talked with unfccc 's dr. harald diaz-bone , review officer and transport expert with the un climate secretariat 's implementation programme , about how intelligent , so-called ' integrated ' transport policies can help stabilise emissions .

the floods , droughts and fires which many experts attribute to global warming are leading to a large loss of human life every year and destroying or endangering the livelihood of many people .
climate change is also speeding up the extinction of the planet 's already dwindling animal and plant species .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the rapidly accelerating warming the world is now experiencing could trigger dramatic climatic changes across the entire planet which go beyond the loss of entire islands through rising sea levels .
these include the onset of a new ice age in the northern hemisphere , brought about by the shut-down of the gulf stream .
there is no longer a serious scientific debate as to whether global warming is taking place or not and whether or not it is being caused by humankind .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change , made up of the world 's leading climate experts , has established this as a fact .
the international community took the first decisive steps to act against global warming at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 .
at the summit , it was agreed to establish the united nations climate convention , which in turn led to the development of the kyoto protocol .
the protocol was first drawn up in japan in 1997 and is designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
the kyoto agreement has yet to be ratified by enough industrialised countries to enter into force .
and it has been repudiated by the usa , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
however , many nongovernmental organisations and the united nations climate secretariat have managed to raise public awareness with regard to the issue in recent times .
in a special series of interviews , conducted with un experts , deutsche welle looks at issues such as emission trends , clean technologies and mobility and at what the world 's emerging economies are doing to adapt to the effects of climate change . dw-world.de the work of the un climate secretariat in bonn john hay from dw talked with joke waller-hunter , unfccc executive secretary , and asked her about her mission to persuade the international community of the need to act against global warming and the work of her organisation .
sustainable development as a tool to combat climate change john hay from dw talked to janos pasztor , coordinator of the unfccc ’ s sustainable development programme and asked him first about the potential india and other asian countries had to implement the type of clean technologies presented at the new delhi climate change technology bazaar .
greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions the unfccc implementation programme is responsible for gathering data concerning the amount of greenhouse gases emitted .
how intelligent transport policies can help stabilise emissions dw 's john hay talked with unfccc 's dr. harald diaz-bone , review officer and transport expert with the un climate secretariat 's implementation programme , about how intelligent , so-called ' integrated ' transport policies can help stabilise emissions .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.12.2003 right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher 's brand of populist rhetoric has struck a nerve in switzerland .
when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .
he 's also announced he 'll be stepping down as chief executive of the swiss plastics and chemicals giant ems chemie , the company with which he made his fortune , by the end of the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election upsets traditional stability switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party -lrb- oct .

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .

until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .
he 's also announced he 'll be stepping down as chief executive of the swiss plastics and chemicals giant ems chemie , the company with which he made his fortune , by the end of the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election upsets traditional stability switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party -lrb- oct .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .

brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .
" china is a nuclear state and has sufficient fissile material for its arms program .
so , why the controls ?

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .

the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .

in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .

the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .
" china is a nuclear state and has sufficient fissile material for its arms program .
so , why the controls ?

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .
he 's also announced he 'll be stepping down as chief executive of the swiss plastics and chemicals giant ems chemie , the company with which he made his fortune , by the end of the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election upsets traditional stability switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party -lrb- oct .

in a special media partnership , deutsche welle is running a series of interviews in which leading experts of the united nations climate secretariat explain how global warming is affecting the planet and what can be done to combat climate change or least mitigate its effects .
the floods , droughts and fires which many experts attribute to global warming are leading to a large loss of human life every year and destroying or endangering the livelihood of many people .
climate change is also speeding up the extinction of the planet 's already dwindling animal and plant species .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the rapidly accelerating warming the world is now experiencing could trigger dramatic climatic changes across the entire planet which go beyond the loss of entire islands through rising sea levels .
these include the onset of a new ice age in the northern hemisphere , brought about by the shut-down of the gulf stream .
there is no longer a serious scientific debate as to whether global warming is taking place or not and whether or not it is being caused by humankind .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change , made up of the world 's leading climate experts , has established this as a fact .
the international community took the first decisive steps to act against global warming at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 .
at the summit , it was agreed to establish the united nations climate convention , which in turn led to the development of the kyoto protocol .
the protocol was first drawn up in japan in 1997 and is designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
the kyoto agreement has yet to be ratified by enough industrialised countries to enter into force .
and it has been repudiated by the usa , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
however , many nongovernmental organisations and the united nations climate secretariat have managed to raise public awareness with regard to the issue in recent times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2003 focus on climate climate change is the biggest over-arching environmental challenge presently facing humankind .
in a special media partnership , deutsche welle is running a series of interviews in which leading experts of the united nations climate secretariat explain how global warming is affecting the planet and what can be done to combat climate change or least mitigate its effects .
the floods , droughts and fires which many experts attribute to global warming are leading to a large loss of human life every year and destroying or endangering the livelihood of many people .
climate change is also speeding up the extinction of the planet 's already dwindling animal and plant species .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the rapidly accelerating warming the world is now experiencing could trigger dramatic climatic changes across the entire planet which go beyond the loss of entire islands through rising sea levels .
these include the onset of a new ice age in the northern hemisphere , brought about by the shut-down of the gulf stream .
there is no longer a serious scientific debate as to whether global warming is taking place or not and whether or not it is being caused by humankind .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change , made up of the world 's leading climate experts , has established this as a fact .
the international community took the first decisive steps to act against global warming at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 .
at the summit , it was agreed to establish the united nations climate convention , which in turn led to the development of the kyoto protocol .
the protocol was first drawn up in japan in 1997 and is designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
the kyoto agreement has yet to be ratified by enough industrialised countries to enter into force .
and it has been repudiated by the usa , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
however , many nongovernmental organisations and the united nations climate secretariat have managed to raise public awareness with regard to the issue in recent times .
in a special series of interviews , conducted with un experts , deutsche welle looks at issues such as emission trends , clean technologies and mobility and at what the world 's emerging economies are doing to adapt to the effects of climate change . dw-world.de the work of the un climate secretariat in bonn john hay from dw talked with joke waller-hunter , unfccc executive secretary , and asked her about her mission to persuade the international community of the need to act against global warming and the work of her organisation .
sustainable development as a tool to combat climate change john hay from dw talked to janos pasztor , coordinator of the unfccc ’ s sustainable development programme and asked him first about the potential india and other asian countries had to implement the type of clean technologies presented at the new delhi climate change technology bazaar .
greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions the unfccc implementation programme is responsible for gathering data concerning the amount of greenhouse gases emitted .
how intelligent transport policies can help stabilise emissions dw 's john hay talked with unfccc 's dr. harald diaz-bone , review officer and transport expert with the un climate secretariat 's implementation programme , about how intelligent , so-called ' integrated ' transport policies can help stabilise emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.12.2003 right-wing populist wins seat in swiss cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph blocher 's brand of populist rhetoric has struck a nerve in switzerland .
when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .
he 's also announced he 'll be stepping down as chief executive of the swiss plastics and chemicals giant ems chemie , the company with which he made his fortune , by the end of the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss election upsets traditional stability switzerland was shocked out of its apathy on sunday when , for the first time in decades , the election of a new parliament resulted in a turn-around of the status quo and a triumph of the right-wing people 's party -lrb- oct .

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .
restraints of referendum system the swiss government is required to hold referendums on controversial issues if campaigners have collected 100,000 signatures - a tradition which helps limit a single party 's effectiveness in pushing through their own agenda .
until now , blocher has used this to his own advantage .
in 1986 , he founded the campaign for an independent and neutral switzerland -lrb- cins -rrb- and organized campaigns and referendums to maintain swiss neutrality and keep the country out of international organizations such as the un .
-lrb- swiss voters finally approved the country 's entry into the international body in 2002 . -rrb-
the ultra-conservative svp has also frequently used the referendum system to counter government policy on issues including european integration and immigration .
it is not yet clear which portfolio blocher will be given , but he 's been widely tipped as finance minister .
if so , he 's expected to push ahead with reforms aimed at reducing low economic growth , cutting taxes and tackling the country 's growing unemployment problem .

when the swiss parliament voted to build a new government cabinet on wednesday , it may well have ushered in an era of political change . just weeks after the right-wing swiss people 's party swept to victory in october 's elections , the party has won a second seat in the cabinet , switzerland 's executive body on wednesday .
it 's a development that alters the face of swiss politics for the first time in 44 years . a cat among the pigeons the appointment of industrialist billionaire christoph blocher , best known for his outspoken views on asylum seekers and immigrants and his criticism of the eu , marks the most serious political upset in switzerland in years .
estimated to be the ninth-richest person in switzerland , the 63-year-old populist politician 's arrival in the cabinet certainly puts the cat among the pigeons . the same four parties have governed switzerland since 1959 with what 's called " a magic formula " - a seven-member cabinet carved up between two socialist ministers -lrb- sp -rrb- , two radicals -lrb- fdp -rrb- , two christian democrats -lrb- cvp -rrb- and one member of the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- .
blocher responded to his appointment by saying " i will do everything in my power within this government to solve the problems facing this country - and which i believe to be more serious than so far assumed . "
blocher 's election gives his party two seats instead of their usual one , while the christian democrats have lost the seat held by justice minister ruth metzler-arnold - leaving just one woman in the cabinet , foreign minister micheline calmy-rey .
metzler-arnold described the move as " a black day for women and the younger generation . "
appointment stirs protests many agreed , with some 2,500 demonstrators taking to switzerland 's streets to protest at blocher 's appointment .
although conflicting policies will be inevitable , blocher maintains he will not rock the traditional consensus and that he can work within the coalition .
observers are keen to see if the increase in the isolationist people 's party power will have an impact on swiss policy .
while many are concerned by the increased extremist presence within the cabinet , others believe that anchoring this sort of firebrand party within government will keep its more controversial policies from spreading further .
swing to the right in recent years , the people 's party has moved increasingly to the right , doubling its support in the process .
in october 's elections , the party scooped 27.7 percent of the votes , the highest share of the vote for a political party in switzerland in some 60 years .
with asylum applications in switzerland rising by over 25 percent in 2002 , the country has seen a recent rise in xenophobia .
in the run-up to the general elections , the people 's party drew criticism for its inflammatory , anti-immigration campaign .
when the un 's refugee body condemned the campaign 's message , which appeared to blame the country 's rising crime rate on asylum seekers , a series of posters that featured what critics described as racist caricatures were withdrawn .
after wednesday 's vote , hildegard fessler from the socialists said " mr blocher ... marginalizes minorities and fans the flames of xenophobia " , adding that " he breaches values important to the swiss people , such as tolerance . "
nonetheless , blocher 's party seems to have touched a national nerve .
it was the increased support for the people 's party reflected in the general elections that prompted them to demand greater representation in parliament .
but his power may be restrained by the country 's traditional referendum system .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .

the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .

berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s junior coalition partners from the environmentalist greens party might just get their way in a row over the sale of mothballed plutonium plant to china .
on thursday , greens experts said they were confident the deal would now fall through .
" i no longer believe that the sale of the hanau plutonium plant to china will now take place , " michaele hustedt , green party spokesperson on energy affairs told daily berliner zeitung .
" the project will most likely be covertly and silently buried , " she said .
the issue has sparked an uproar among the green party , who fear china could use the plant to produce weapons-grade plutonium for military use .
they say the export also smacks of hypocrisy , since berlin is committed to phasing out nuclear power on german soil .
the plant , built by industrial group siemens ag in hanau near frankfurt , was closed down in 1995 without ever going into service .
despite schröder ’ s instance that beijing has assured him the plant would not be used for military purposes and there are no legal grounds to ban the sale , critics say the plant , designed to reprocess plutonium to make so-called mixed-oxide or mox fuel rods for nuclear power stations , could be used to manufacture atomic weapons .
spd , greens agree on international checks after days of wrangling , the schröder ’ s social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens agreed this week that they would approve the export of the plant only if china formally agreed to let the plant be supervised by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna .
in addition , stringent regulations would be put in place to ensure that the plant could not be used for military purposes .
the greens believe the strict checks will now effectively make it tougher for the planned sale to reach completion .
green politician winfried hermann said the planned obligatory supervision would spell " the death of the deal . "
a further hurdle for the planned € 50 million -lrb- $ 61.29 million -rrb- deal surfaced this week when brussels announced it would check the legality of the proposed sale .
eu eyes plutonium export the eu commission is reported to be probing whether the deal violates european union export rules .
eu law states the export of material that can possibly be used for military purposes is subject to the obtaining of a permit .
green members of the european parliament announced on wednesday that the sale of the plutonium plant also breached a eu commission decree drawn up in 2000 , which bans the export of all goods that can be used " in any form to aid the production of nuclear weapons . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protests against plutonium export greens european parliament member daniel cohn-bendit wrote in a letter to the eu commission that the planned deal would " threaten military and other security interests of europe and its allies . "
according to reports in the german media , eu experts also believ the plutonium deal would run counter to the eu ’ s new strategy against the spread of weapons of mass destruction . the intergovernmental conference of eu leaders this weekend also are expected to pass a resolution over tightening existing eu export regulations .
iaea confused schröder ’ s social democrats , however , say the deal could yet be salvaged . government spokesman bela anda said on wednesday that the sale wasn ’ t threatened by the planned regulations .
ditmar staffelt , deputy economics minister echoed that view , but added the success of the deal hinged on china and its readiness to comply with international controls .
but mark gwozdecky , a spokesman for the iaea , said the checks demanded by the spd and the greens suggested didn ’ t make much sense .
" i don ’ t know what such controls on-site are supposed to achieve , " gwozdecky told the financial times deutschland on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2003 focus on climate climate change is the biggest over-arching environmental challenge presently facing humankind .
in a special media partnership , deutsche welle is running a series of interviews in which leading experts of the united nations climate secretariat explain how global warming is affecting the planet and what can be done to combat climate change or least mitigate its effects .
the floods , droughts and fires which many experts attribute to global warming are leading to a large loss of human life every year and destroying or endangering the livelihood of many people .
climate change is also speeding up the extinction of the planet 's already dwindling animal and plant species .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the rapidly accelerating warming the world is now experiencing could trigger dramatic climatic changes across the entire planet which go beyond the loss of entire islands through rising sea levels .
these include the onset of a new ice age in the northern hemisphere , brought about by the shut-down of the gulf stream .
there is no longer a serious scientific debate as to whether global warming is taking place or not and whether or not it is being caused by humankind .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change , made up of the world 's leading climate experts , has established this as a fact .
the international community took the first decisive steps to act against global warming at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 .
at the summit , it was agreed to establish the united nations climate convention , which in turn led to the development of the kyoto protocol .
the protocol was first drawn up in japan in 1997 and is designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
the kyoto agreement has yet to be ratified by enough industrialised countries to enter into force .
and it has been repudiated by the usa , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
however , many nongovernmental organisations and the united nations climate secretariat have managed to raise public awareness with regard to the issue in recent times .
in a special series of interviews , conducted with un experts , deutsche welle looks at issues such as emission trends , clean technologies and mobility and at what the world 's emerging economies are doing to adapt to the effects of climate change . dw-world.de the work of the un climate secretariat in bonn john hay from dw talked with joke waller-hunter , unfccc executive secretary , and asked her about her mission to persuade the international community of the need to act against global warming and the work of her organisation .
sustainable development as a tool to combat climate change john hay from dw talked to janos pasztor , coordinator of the unfccc ’ s sustainable development programme and asked him first about the potential india and other asian countries had to implement the type of clean technologies presented at the new delhi climate change technology bazaar .
greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions the unfccc implementation programme is responsible for gathering data concerning the amount of greenhouse gases emitted .
how intelligent transport policies can help stabilise emissions dw 's john hay talked with unfccc 's dr. harald diaz-bone , review officer and transport expert with the un climate secretariat 's implementation programme , about how intelligent , so-called ' integrated ' transport policies can help stabilise emissions .

in a special media partnership , deutsche welle is running a series of interviews in which leading experts of the united nations climate secretariat explain how global warming is affecting the planet and what can be done to combat climate change or least mitigate its effects .
the floods , droughts and fires which many experts attribute to global warming are leading to a large loss of human life every year and destroying or endangering the livelihood of many people .
climate change is also speeding up the extinction of the planet 's already dwindling animal and plant species .
a growing body of evidence suggests that the rapidly accelerating warming the world is now experiencing could trigger dramatic climatic changes across the entire planet which go beyond the loss of entire islands through rising sea levels .
these include the onset of a new ice age in the northern hemisphere , brought about by the shut-down of the gulf stream .
there is no longer a serious scientific debate as to whether global warming is taking place or not and whether or not it is being caused by humankind .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change , made up of the world 's leading climate experts , has established this as a fact .
the international community took the first decisive steps to act against global warming at the rio de janeiro earth summit in 1992 .
at the summit , it was agreed to establish the united nations climate convention , which in turn led to the development of the kyoto protocol .
the protocol was first drawn up in japan in 1997 and is designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
the kyoto agreement has yet to be ratified by enough industrialised countries to enter into force .
and it has been repudiated by the usa , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
however , many nongovernmental organisations and the united nations climate secretariat have managed to raise public awareness with regard to the issue in recent times .
in a special series of interviews , conducted with un experts , deutsche welle looks at issues such as emission trends , clean technologies and mobility and at what the world 's emerging economies are doing to adapt to the effects of climate change . dw-world.de the work of the un climate secretariat in bonn john hay from dw talked with joke waller-hunter , unfccc executive secretary , and asked her about her mission to persuade the international community of the need to act against global warming and the work of her organisation .

experts at cambridge university have found the traditional " wedding cake " shape - a wide bottom tapering elegantly to a pointed top - is slowly giving way to one that is squat and bushy .
they say the change is due to extra nitrogen in the air caused by pollution .
the nitrogen acts like fertiliser , making the trees grow more branches .
but , far from being seen as environmental damage , the trend is bringing comfort and joy to england 's christmas tree growers - mainly based in east anglia .
christmas tree facts about 65 million christmas trees are currently growing across britain british growers sell about seven million trees a year , some of which are exported an additional one million trees are imported into britain from abroad .
dr david hanke , from the university of cambridge , led a three-year study in which spruce trees were sprayed with a range of chemicals to see how they were affected by pollution .
" we found that nitrogen caused a big rise in levels of a hormone called cytokinin that causes christmas trees to grow more branches , " said dr hanke .
" the level goes up five-fold , which is quite a large increase . "
farms were releasing nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere from fertilisers and animal sewage , said dr hanke .
pigs and battery chickens were two of the biggest culprits .
christmas trees easily absorb ammonia , which contains nitrogen , given off by their waste .
" it 's coming down in the rain and being blown over the trees , " said dr hanke .
but , dr hanke warned , not everyone was going to cheer the growth of the shorter and fatter trees .
science museum " the germans are going to be hopping mad , " he said .
they prefer sparser trees , often regarded as too spindly in britain .
roger hay , secretary of the british christmas tree growers ' association , said the effects of pollution on christmas trees might even be helpful to the industry .
" we have to make christmas trees bushier by pruning and shearing , so this will save the growers some work , " he said .
the new research was highlighted in new scientist magazine and will also be featured in a display opening at the science museum in london on thursday .

the commission has made revisions to its original proposals .
however , the plans will still result in the number of westminster seats being reduced from 72 to 59 .
the commission is also likely to forge ahead with its requirement to look at holyrood 's seats , despite a government commitment to retain all 129 msps .
the proposals for each scottish constituency are the result of a lengthy consultation exercise and a series of public inquiries .
among those whose seat is in danger is that of scottish secretary alistair darling himself , who will receive the plans from the commission .

talland house in st ives was the childhood holiday home of the novelist virginia woolf and the view over st ives bay inspired her novel to the lighthouse .
on monday , penwith district council planners will consider an application to build 20 flats on the property 's old garden , which is now a car park .
the house itself is now divided up into apartments .
i can understand people naturally being wary of any change mike bradbury , architect vanessa curtis from the virginia woolf society of great britain says the view is worthy of preservation .
" it 's already upsetting in that what used to be the orchard of talland house is now a public car park .
" but at least at the moment you can still stand on the balconies at talland house and see the view virginia saw as a little girl , " said ms curtis .
' world ' opinion " but if an apartment block is built there , then that view will be completely blocked . "
but the architect behind the £ 3m plan to build the 20 luxury apartments has defended the project .
mike bradbury says the high number of objections does not truly reflect local opinion .
" i can understand people naturally being wary of any change , it 's something we find on a regular basis in st ives , " he said .
" but i think the reason we 've got a lot of objections here is that the virginia woolf society of great britain have solicited a lot of objections not just from england but all over the world . "
the owner of the site already holds full planning permission to build 13 flats .

the decision will allow the two water companies to increase charges from april 2004 to march 2005 .
the average water and sewerage bill for united 's customers - in september 2003 prices - will increase by around £ 21 to £ 273 next year , ofwat said .
northumbrian , which also operates in essex and suffolk , will see average bills rise by around £ 21 to £ 233 .
the increases come after both companies asked for help to cover rising customer debt problems , as well as the cost of monitoring water standards .
ofwat regrets united said it was also facing rising construction costs , while northumbrian said that falling water demand was an issue .
ofwat director general philip fletcher said : " i regret the need for an increase , but i have a responsibility to ensure that prudent and well-managed water companies can finance the services they provide to customers . "
he said : " the extra costs the two companies face are substantial enough to require an increase in bills . "
water companies across britain have been pressuring ofwat to allow them to raise prices to help pay for improvements to services .
united utilities , which operates in north west england , welcomed ofwat 's decision , which it said recognised the " additional costs " the firm faced .

the decision will allow the two water companies to increase charges from april 2004 to march 2005 .
the average water and sewerage bill for united 's customers - in september 2003 prices - will increase by around £ 21 to £ 273 next year , ofwat said .
northumbrian , which also operates in essex and suffolk , will see average bills rise by around £ 21 to £ 233 .
the increases come after both companies asked for help to cover rising customer debt problems , as well as the cost of monitoring water standards .
ofwat regrets united said it was also facing rising construction costs , while northumbrian said that falling water demand was an issue .
ofwat director general philip fletcher said : " i regret the need for an increase , but i have a responsibility to ensure that prudent and well-managed water companies can finance the services they provide to customers . "
he said : " the extra costs the two companies face are substantial enough to require an increase in bills . "

the deal , worth more than $ 1bn , was completed in adelaide on thursday and signed by the two countries ' foreign ministers .
it is part of australia 's new role as peacekeeper in the south pacific .
earlier this year australia led a force of 2,000 regional troops to restore order in the solomon islands .
thursday 's deal will mean that up to 230 australian police will arrive in papua new guinea next year to fight crime , and also to ensure that the country does not become a base for terrorism .
" our close historical ties and the extensive personal relationships between australians and papua new guineans underpin a common interest in peace and stability in a region free from terrorism , " australia 's foreign minister , alexander downer , said in a statement .
his papua new guinea counterpart , rabbie namaliu , said that the deployment of australian police would in no way affect the sovereignty of his country , which became independent from australia in 1975 .
the deal was instigated by australia and initially opposed by papua new guinea 's nationalist prime minister , michael somare .
as well as providing police officers , around 70 australian officials will also take up positions in papua new guinea 's public sector .
at least four australian judges will sit on the papua new guinea bench and an australian will become the country 's top lawyer , the solicitor-general , to try and improve the justice system .
australian civil servants will also take on senior roles in economic management , immigration and prisons .

the first of south central 's old carriages was ripped apart on wednesday in a railway scrapyard in grimsby .
after the clapham rail disaster in 1988 which killed 35 people , the slam-door trains were criticised by the health and safety executive .
six hundred more of the 40-year-old carriages will be scrapped during the next two years .
replacements are being phased in over the next 18 months .
much of the scrapped carriage material will be recycled , said tim gooseman from the railyard in which they are being scrapped .
" for a 35 tonne train you get 32 tonnes of metal recycled into the manufacturing industry , and there 's three tonnes of waste , " he said .

director peter jackson himself has also had to deal with changing fortunes - not least the fact he can no longer walk down the street without being recognised .
more than 100,000 people lined wellington 's courtenay place last week to welcome the director and the stars at the return of the king 's world première .
" for a brief moment in time i knew what it was like to be one of the beatles , " the 42-year-old director said .

when auditions for the lord of the rings took place , many of the actors were told filming the trilogy would take up about nine months of their time .
not quite true - it was , as arwen actress liv tyler has testified , more like four years .
but few are complaining .
taking part in jackson 's trilogy has transformed careers .
take christopher lee -lrb- saruman -rrb- - notwithstanding a last minute argument over his return of the king scenes being cut - he has gained a new generation of fans unaware of his past as the 1950s hammer dracula .
to an actor afraid for decades of being typecast as the fanged villain , that will undoubtedly come as a relief .
orlando bloom -lrb- right -rrb- went on to star with johnny depp in pirates of the caribbean orlando bloom , who plays elf legolas , has capitalised on his rings fame the quickest .
just months after the release of the fellowship of the ring he was starring in black hawk down , ridley scott 's tale of a botched us military operation in somalia in 1993 .
iconic hero but it was this summer that he really showed his post-rings mettle , starring as the dashing will turner in the massive hit pirates of the caribbean : the curse of the black pearl .
bloom has already signed up to a sequel - but even before then adds to a heroic cv with a part in the upcoming troy , playing the warrior paris .
viggo mortensen , who plays the brooding aragorn , has capped a long career playing enigmatic heroes .
but it was lord of the rings that made him a star .
his final portrayal of aragorn could make him an oscar contender .
having played the most iconic movie maverick since han solo , a late start as an action hero seems to beckon .
but the danish-speaking mortensen 's post aragorn roles in the future are in an adventure about a horse-rider -lrb- hidalgo -rrb- and voice work in the sci-fi animation live freaky die freaky .
billy boyd , right , full-size in master and commander as for the hobbits , billy boyd -lrb- pippin -rrb- has already starred in another blockbuster , russell crowe 's master and commander : the far side of the world .
he played coxswain barrett bonden - though the part required the actor to say little more than " south , southwest , sir " .
elijah wood , who plays frodo , is playing a darker role as one of his next projects - that of a harvard student-turned football yob in the film hooligans .
before that he will be seen in next year 's eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , a script from being john malkovich and adaptation writer charlie kaufman , where a couple try to halt their failing relationship by having their bad memories erased .
in a lighter moment , he has also given his voice to happy feet , an animated adventure about a musical penguin which will be released in 2006 .
director peter jackson himself has also had to deal with changing fortunes - not least the fact he can no longer walk down the street without being recognised .
jackson has said the fans ' adulation made him feel like a beatle more than 100,000 people lined wellington 's courtenay place last week to welcome the director and the stars at the return of the king 's world première .
" for a brief moment in time i knew what it was like to be one of the beatles , " the 42-year-old director said .
the trilogy has turned the director from a cult film-maker into a hollywood goldmine , with a real chance of walking away with a major oscar in 2004 .
he has been handed an upfront fee of over £ 12m - the highest in cinema history - to direct his next film , a remake of king kong .
painstaking ten years ago alien movie bad taste , filmed in any spare time he had from his job on a wellington newspaper , saw jackson directing , filming , making his own props - and even starring as a hapless commando .
but for lord of the rings more than 15,000 people were involved in making the films , and jackson developed his special effects workshop into a state-of-the-art complex to rival anything in hollywood .
wellington has thrown its weight behind rings fever another big winner has been new zealand itself .
the new zealand tourist authorities have leaped on the publicity opportunities , using slogans such as " you 've seen it for three hours - now see it for three weeks " - and " best supporting country in a motion picture " .
now some talk of a " frodo economy " - it is reported that one in 10 of new zealand 's tourists are making their visits because of lord of the rings .

people living in church street , spent the night in the town 's leisure centre after being moved from their homes shortly after the fire was reported at 2300 gmt on wednesday .

the fire was 150ft above ground level , which was high for firefighters to tackle " fire officer dave morris an 18-month programme of renovation work has been in progress at the church for the last six months .
scaffolding was already in place around the spire and there were fears over the damage caused by the fire .

structural engineers , have visited the site and remedial work is being undertaken to make the spire safe .
the rector , geoff waggett said he was relieved that the damage was contained .
" we thought it was going to be a lot worse than it has actually turned out to be , " he said .
fire officer dave morris , from south wales fire service , said the height of the fire in the church spire made it difficult to tackle .
he told bbc radio wales : " the fire was 150ft above ground level , which was high for firefighters to tackle .
" with severe winds at that time of night , it was a tough job to extinguish .
' severe damage ' " we had to tackle it from outside the spire and on the scaffolding that was being used to renovate the church . "
mr morris added that it took crews with three fire engines , a hydraulic platform and special line rescue unit , between three and four hours to put out the flames .
" there is severe damage to structural supporting elements and the main beams holding it together were badly damaged , " he said .
" the spire is structurally unstable with a possible risk of collapse .
