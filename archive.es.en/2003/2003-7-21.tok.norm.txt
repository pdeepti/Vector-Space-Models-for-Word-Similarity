germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales . it ’ s summer in germany , the evenings are warm and long and life has taken on a relaxed air .
especially since june .
that ’ s when the german parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays -lrb- till 8 p.m. -rrb- , spelling an end to the nightmarish saturday afternoon rush to buy weekend groceries before 4 p.m.
germany ’ s limited shopping hours , among the most restrictive in the industrialized world , have long been criticized by foreigners for making the shopping experience too stressful .
even domestic retail and industry associations have opined that stringent regulations choke consumer spending and contribute towards the general economic downturn .
first set in stone in 1956 , the law dictating germany 's restrictive shopping hours was last reformed in the 1990s , when lawmakers extended weekday shopping to 8 p.m.
backed by retail associations and industry and strongly opposed by the unions , chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social-democrat-green coalition finally pushed through the amendments in june .
department chains rake in profits less than one month later , the move has already begun to pay off .
retail stores , especially in downtown districts , have begun to profit from the new saturday opening hours .
last week kaufhof warenhäuser ag , one of the country ’ s largest department store chains , registered a marked increase in sales .
a spokesman cited the greater customer turnout on saturdays as the reason .
competing retailer karstadtquelle also reported an overall jump in business on saturdays with a profit increase in the " high two-digit region . "
however , most department chain stores say it ’ s too early to release official figures on their profits .
karstadtquelle spokesman elmar kratz told deutsche welle that customers made use of the new opportunity to shop beyond the earlier limit of 4 p.m. and new customers actually poured in late evening .
he however didn ’ t want to risk concluding the new shopping hours had spurred spending-wary germans to splurge .
relaxed and leisurely shopping but kratz added the atmosphere was distinctly more relaxed and hassle-free .
" the stores are all reporting the same : the shopping experience is clearly more relaxed , the customers come without time pressures .
after all , before june when shops closed at 4 p.m. , the customers had to be forced out of the shops and at the time they argued ‘ i have time now , i want to shop and you ’ re closing the shop , ’ " he said .
kratz said customers making use of the longer opening hours mainly consisted of families .
clothing were the fastest-selling items - including summer apparel , swimwear and children ’ s fashions .
less enthusiasm in southern states but retail associations have reported that not all germans are making use of the " shop longer saturdays . "
according to the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- shoppers enthusiastically spilled out onto the sidewalks of cities such as düsseldorf , kiel , hamburg and leipzig to shop in the weeks since the " shop till you drop saturdays " were introduced .
but the atmosphere has been more subdued in southern germany .
shopping meccas such as munich and stuttgart remained relatively calm and immune from the shopping frenzy apparent in other parts of the country on saturdays .
the same disinterest is also evident in smaller retail shops that still close early despite the opportunity to stay open longer .
karin wiethege , who works in a small specialty shop selling exclusive gift items such as soap and perfumes from the french region of provence on the outskirts of bonn , told deutsche welle she could n't possibly remain in the shop till 8 p.m.
besides , she said , she understood the displeasure of her colleagues regarding longer working hours .
" sure , i understand that .
i would also protest .
if this shop here also remained open till 8 p.m. , i would say : ‘ i ’ m not coming anymore .
my family is too important to me for that . "
no new jobs but creating new jobs to avoid disgruntled employees does n't seem to have been the antidote so far . elmar kratz of karstadtquelle said further jobs weren ’ t planned .
" we ’ re trying to work it out so that employees ’ work routines are adjusted to the new timings .
when there are many customers , there are more employees , when there are less customers , naturally there are less employees – that ’ s how we ’ ve regulated it to start with . "
but while the industry might still be waiting for the expected economic benefits and jobs to materialize from the extended shop opening hours , there ’ s no denying that shopping in germany actually means no more nerve-jangling , shove-jostle-wait matches for groceries on saturday afternoons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .
his departure marks a defeat for modernists at europe 's largest industrial union . klaus zwickel , 64 , has never been secretive about his differences with deputy chairman jürgen peters .
but since an abortive strike last month in eastern germany over working hours , zwickel had gone on the offensive , blaming peters ' old-school tactics for pitting the public against the union and handing ig metall its worst defeat since 1954 . what followed was a public mud-slinging match that had each side accusing the other of mean-spiritedness and ad hominem attacks .
zwickel repeatedly urged peters to resign .
peters held his ground and went on the counteroffensive . on monday morning , zwickel conceded defeat .
at a press conference in frankfurt , he said he was stepping down immediately , before his planned retirement in october .
but he refused to completely shoulder the blame for the failed labor action in june and fired a final shot at his designated successor . " with this step , i do n't take sole responsibility , " said zwickel .
" the main responsibility for the failed strike is with the deputy chairman and the regional leader for berlin , brandenburg and saxony . " he added : " at no point have they shown a willingness to accept personal consequences for the situation . " two at the top despite his best efforts , zwickel had failed in securing support for another leadership constellation and announced that a " tandem solution " will likely be put in place : peters will lead the union along with berthold huber , a regional leader from the federal state of baden-württemberg -lrb- photo , huber left -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall board had tapped the two men for the post-zwickel leadership positions in april , but the subsequent internal strife led huber to withdraw his candidacy .
he agreed to stand for the deputy post again just last week .
zwickel said he could not support such a solution . " today i can definitely say that there will not be a new beginning at ig metall , " said zwickel .
" something i think is urgently needed . " the appointments are expected to be ratified at a special union congress in august . zwickel 's resignation marks the end of his ten-year career at the ig metall helm and of a three-week leadership struggle that came close to tearing the 2.6-million strong metal workers union apart .
it also marked a fight for the future direction of the union .
zwickel , who had planned to step down in october , had hoped to put a reformer in the top spot that could turn the tide at ig metall , which has seen membership decline sharply in the last decade and its influence wane as demands have grown for more flexible wage bargaining . traditionalist jürgen peters is leading figure in the traditionalist camp of the divided union who still supports the ideology of the exploitation of the working class , according to analysts .
he has fiercely opposed any reforms which might been seen as weakening german unions ' traditional strength and collective-bargaining power .
he has been a vocal opponent of chancellor gerhard schröder 's structural reform package that would ease some workers protections and cut welfare for the long-term employed . since joining the union in 1961 , peters has worked his way toward the top .
until the recent strike fiasco , the 59 year old had received high marks for his instincts , tactical skill and ability to play the game of power politics .
even though zwickel opposed his candidacy as chairman back in april , peters was able to mobilize forces among the rank and file and prevail against his own boss . but the failed action in eastern germany for a 35-hour week looked like it could mark the end of his sparkling career .
even those in his own camp criticized him sharply for dragging out a strike that proved highly unpopular with businesses , the government and even the public .
zwickel had accused peters , who is in charge of collective bargaining , of misleading his colleagues about the effects of the strike , which led to shutdowns of auto plants in western germany .
numerous influential union members besides zwickel pushed for him to resign from his deputy position and withdraw his candidacy for the leadership post . peters ignored such entreaties and sat the leadership storm out , working in the background to gather his forces around him .
it was a strategy that worked in the end . long-term effects it is not clear , however , what peters ' victory will mean for the germany 's second-largest union in the long run .
the ascent of a traditionalist could have a negative effect on the german union movement as a whole , say labor analysts . the traditional industry-wide collective-bargaining agreements that german unions have spearheaded for decades are coming under fire as being too inflexible for today 's economy .
some companies are choosing to opt out of collective bargaining agreements , preferring to bypass union leaders and negotiate with workers directly . unions are also suffering from massive membership losses and are increasingly losing their standing among the public , who perceive them as stubbornly blocking structural reform that might pull germany out of its three years of economic stagnation .

1,200 years ago three men set off on a journey from europe to the middle east and back .
today their trip across three cultures and religions is recreated in the aachen exhibit " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . " baghdad and jerusalem .
today the cities conjure up images of armed conflict and religious strife .
for many they are the epitome of the collision between the orient and occident , the battlefields of global interests , where the foreign other is so different and distant from europe .
but a thousand years ago the cities represented the pinnacle of cultural and religious symbiosis and were the choice destination for one of history ’ s lesser-known but certainly more interesting journeys .
the year was 797 in the christian calendar -lrb- 4557 in the jewish and 175 in the muslim dating system -rrb- .
charlemagne , king of the francs , had sent forth two of his envoys and the jewish merchant isaac to the court of harun al rashid , caliph of baghdad .
their mission : establish contact with the ruler of the abbasids and observe the ways of the city on the euphrates .
compared to the town of aachen with its 400 some residents , baghdad was a flourishing metropolis , a renowned place of learning and a melting point for various cultures and religions .
when the envoys departed from charlemagne ’ s court in western germany , the distant lands of the orient were still largely unknown and exotic .
the envoy ’ s route led them first to upper italy , then by ship to the holy city of jerusalem , and from there to baghdad , the seat of the abbasid caliph .
all in all , the men traversed a good portion of the known world at the time , passing through the territories of the three great monotheistic religions : christianity , judaism and islam .
after several months in baghdad , the men embarked on their return journey , laden with gifts , the most impressive of which was a white indian elephant , abu abbas – a symbol of friendship from the muslim caliph to the christian king .
but because the pachyderm was so much slower than a horse , the return voyage turned into an arduous four-year adventure along the southern mediterranean from jerusalem to carthage , where isaac – who was now traveling alone – and abu abbas set sail to italy .
in the spring of 802 , isaac crossed the alps on elephant-back and rode on to aachen in the kingdom of the francs .
today , the story sounds like something straight out of " 1001 arabian nights " and indeed the historical circumstances of the journey are somewhat clouded in legend .
charlemagne ’ s own court chronicler einhart is unusually vague about the envoys ’ journey .
only the return of isaac and the white elephant and their festive reception in aachen ’ s coronation hall on july 20 , 802 , were dutifully recorded in the annals of history .
the rest is left largely up to speculation .
whether or not the men actually stayed at harun al rashid ’ s palace in baghdad , what observations they made and which route they took on their round-trip voyage is still a point of discussion for historians .
near certain , however , is that the entire journey took five years and connected two worlds , the orient and the occident .
follow the elephant it is this centuries-old bridge between the cultures , the link between different religions that serves as the thematic compass for the current exhibit in aachen " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . "
the historical journey from baghdad to aachen via jerusalem winds its way like a red carpet through the exhibit space , guiding visitors through geographically separate locations in aachen , each intended to " recreate " one of the three cities .
ex oriente ’ s overriding themes of inter-cultural dialogue , reciprocal influences and demarcations are superimposed on the rather sketchy historical timeline sprinkled with artifacts garnered from various periods and places along the white elephant ’ s route .
from medieval maps , books and religious manuscripts to tapestry , pottery and jewelry , the exhibit seeks to conjure up the era of charlemagne and the spirit of the journey while juxtaposing it with the tensions of the present day through contemporary art work interspersed throughout the display area .
thus , the visitor is led on a journey through time and space but is at every step of the way conscious of present day limitations , boundaries , and conflicts .
in fact , the visitor is never able to escape these modern road signs , despite the exhibit ’ s attempts to encourage otherwise .
at numerous points on the journey , the visitor is encouraged to " experience the feeling " of baghdad , jerusalem and aachen around 800 , to relive the cultural exchange and the intense blending of various ethnic and religious groups – and yet this is nearly impossible .
at the intersection between cultures , video screens point out that today ’ s trade with the orient rests largely on oil and drugs and that the ancient pilgrimage routes are today ’ s border crossings for refugees and illegal aliens .
over-sized paintings recall the decades of conflict in the middle east while photo montages and installations offer a running commentary on the collision of the religions and the failure to find a lasting peace .
as the exhibit itself proclaims , the combination of historical and contemporary objects intends to provoke the visitor to ask questions about his or her own cultural background and to think about ways to recreate , or better yet emulate , isaac ’ s cultural mission of observing , appreciating and respecting the other .
unfortunately , the visitor leaves wanting to have other more mundane questions addressed like how the elephant survived the northern climate , what political connection charlemagne had with harun al rashid and why isaac ’ s journey never warranted more than a footnote in history books .
but then again maybe these rather pointed historical questions can serve as the departure point for further investigations into inter-cultural history , because such travels certainly weren ’ t limited to charlemagne ’ s period .
and in the end it might just be the curious pursuers of historical facts who , in the exhibit ’ s frequently quoted words of aristotle , wonder and marvel and thereby create the basis for all quests of knowledge and understanding .
in the case of " ex oriente , " it is the visitor who leaves the exhibit enchanted with the concept of documenting a 1,200 year old journey and questions its relevance to today 's realities .

saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales . it ’ s summer in germany , the evenings are warm and long and life has taken on a relaxed air .

1,200 years ago three men set off on a journey from europe to the middle east and back .
today their trip across three cultures and religions is recreated in the aachen exhibit " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . " baghdad and jerusalem .
today the cities conjure up images of armed conflict and religious strife .
for many they are the epitome of the collision between the orient and occident , the battlefields of global interests , where the foreign other is so different and distant from europe .
but a thousand years ago the cities represented the pinnacle of cultural and religious symbiosis and were the choice destination for one of history ’ s lesser-known but certainly more interesting journeys .
the year was 797 in the christian calendar -lrb- 4557 in the jewish and 175 in the muslim dating system -rrb- .
charlemagne , king of the francs , had sent forth two of his envoys and the jewish merchant isaac to the court of harun al rashid , caliph of baghdad .
their mission : establish contact with the ruler of the abbasids and observe the ways of the city on the euphrates .
compared to the town of aachen with its 400 some residents , baghdad was a flourishing metropolis , a renowned place of learning and a melting point for various cultures and religions .
when the envoys departed from charlemagne ’ s court in western germany , the distant lands of the orient were still largely unknown and exotic .
the envoy ’ s route led them first to upper italy , then by ship to the holy city of jerusalem , and from there to baghdad , the seat of the abbasid caliph .
all in all , the men traversed a good portion of the known world at the time , passing through the territories of the three great monotheistic religions : christianity , judaism and islam .
after several months in baghdad , the men embarked on their return journey , laden with gifts , the most impressive of which was a white indian elephant , abu abbas – a symbol of friendship from the muslim caliph to the christian king .
but because the pachyderm was so much slower than a horse , the return voyage turned into an arduous four-year adventure along the southern mediterranean from jerusalem to carthage , where isaac – who was now traveling alone – and abu abbas set sail to italy .
in the spring of 802 , isaac crossed the alps on elephant-back and rode on to aachen in the kingdom of the francs .
today , the story sounds like something straight out of " 1001 arabian nights " and indeed the historical circumstances of the journey are somewhat clouded in legend .
charlemagne ’ s own court chronicler einhart is unusually vague about the envoys ’ journey .
only the return of isaac and the white elephant and their festive reception in aachen ’ s coronation hall on july 20 , 802 , were dutifully recorded in the annals of history .
the rest is left largely up to speculation .
whether or not the men actually stayed at harun al rashid ’ s palace in baghdad , what observations they made and which route they took on their round-trip voyage is still a point of discussion for historians .
near certain , however , is that the entire journey took five years and connected two worlds , the orient and the occident .
follow the elephant it is this centuries-old bridge between the cultures , the link between different religions that serves as the thematic compass for the current exhibit in aachen " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . "
the historical journey from baghdad to aachen via jerusalem winds its way like a red carpet through the exhibit space , guiding visitors through geographically separate locations in aachen , each intended to " recreate " one of the three cities .
ex oriente ’ s overriding themes of inter-cultural dialogue , reciprocal influences and demarcations are superimposed on the rather sketchy historical timeline sprinkled with artifacts garnered from various periods and places along the white elephant ’ s route .
from medieval maps , books and religious manuscripts to tapestry , pottery and jewelry , the exhibit seeks to conjure up the era of charlemagne and the spirit of the journey while juxtaposing it with the tensions of the present day through contemporary art work interspersed throughout the display area .
thus , the visitor is led on a journey through time and space but is at every step of the way conscious of present day limitations , boundaries , and conflicts .
in fact , the visitor is never able to escape these modern road signs , despite the exhibit ’ s attempts to encourage otherwise .
at numerous points on the journey , the visitor is encouraged to " experience the feeling " of baghdad , jerusalem and aachen around 800 , to relive the cultural exchange and the intense blending of various ethnic and religious groups – and yet this is nearly impossible .
at the intersection between cultures , video screens point out that today ’ s trade with the orient rests largely on oil and drugs and that the ancient pilgrimage routes are today ’ s border crossings for refugees and illegal aliens .
over-sized paintings recall the decades of conflict in the middle east while photo montages and installations offer a running commentary on the collision of the religions and the failure to find a lasting peace .
as the exhibit itself proclaims , the combination of historical and contemporary objects intends to provoke the visitor to ask questions about his or her own cultural background and to think about ways to recreate , or better yet emulate , isaac ’ s cultural mission of observing , appreciating and respecting the other .
unfortunately , the visitor leaves wanting to have other more mundane questions addressed like how the elephant survived the northern climate , what political connection charlemagne had with harun al rashid and why isaac ’ s journey never warranted more than a footnote in history books .
but then again maybe these rather pointed historical questions can serve as the departure point for further investigations into inter-cultural history , because such travels certainly weren ’ t limited to charlemagne ’ s period .
and in the end it might just be the curious pursuers of historical facts who , in the exhibit ’ s frequently quoted words of aristotle , wonder and marvel and thereby create the basis for all quests of knowledge and understanding .
in the case of " ex oriente , " it is the visitor who leaves the exhibit enchanted with the concept of documenting a 1,200 year old journey and questions its relevance to today 's realities .

germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales . it ’ s summer in germany , the evenings are warm and long and life has taken on a relaxed air .
especially since june .
that ’ s when the german parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays -lrb- till 8 p.m. -rrb- , spelling an end to the nightmarish saturday afternoon rush to buy weekend groceries before 4 p.m.
germany ’ s limited shopping hours , among the most restrictive in the industrialized world , have long been criticized by foreigners for making the shopping experience too stressful .
even domestic retail and industry associations have opined that stringent regulations choke consumer spending and contribute towards the general economic downturn .
first set in stone in 1956 , the law dictating germany 's restrictive shopping hours was last reformed in the 1990s , when lawmakers extended weekday shopping to 8 p.m.
backed by retail associations and industry and strongly opposed by the unions , chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social-democrat-green coalition finally pushed through the amendments in june .
department chains rake in profits less than one month later , the move has already begun to pay off .
retail stores , especially in downtown districts , have begun to profit from the new saturday opening hours .
last week kaufhof warenhäuser ag , one of the country ’ s largest department store chains , registered a marked increase in sales .
a spokesman cited the greater customer turnout on saturdays as the reason .
competing retailer karstadtquelle also reported an overall jump in business on saturdays with a profit increase in the " high two-digit region . "
however , most department chain stores say it ’ s too early to release official figures on their profits .
karstadtquelle spokesman elmar kratz told deutsche welle that customers made use of the new opportunity to shop beyond the earlier limit of 4 p.m. and new customers actually poured in late evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.07.2003 reform wing loses in union power struggle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwickel steps down amid much union acrimony .
the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .
his departure marks a defeat for modernists at europe 's largest industrial union . klaus zwickel , 64 , has never been secretive about his differences with deputy chairman jürgen peters .
but since an abortive strike last month in eastern germany over working hours , zwickel had gone on the offensive , blaming peters ' old-school tactics for pitting the public against the union and handing ig metall its worst defeat since 1954 . what followed was a public mud-slinging match that had each side accusing the other of mean-spiritedness and ad hominem attacks .
zwickel repeatedly urged peters to resign .
peters held his ground and went on the counteroffensive . on monday morning , zwickel conceded defeat .
at a press conference in frankfurt , he said he was stepping down immediately , before his planned retirement in october .
but he refused to completely shoulder the blame for the failed labor action in june and fired a final shot at his designated successor . " with this step , i do n't take sole responsibility , " said zwickel .
" the main responsibility for the failed strike is with the deputy chairman and the regional leader for berlin , brandenburg and saxony . " he added : " at no point have they shown a willingness to accept personal consequences for the situation . " two at the top despite his best efforts , zwickel had failed in securing support for another leadership constellation and announced that a " tandem solution " will likely be put in place : peters will lead the union along with berthold huber , a regional leader from the federal state of baden-württemberg -lrb- photo , huber left -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall board had tapped the two men for the post-zwickel leadership positions in april , but the subsequent internal strife led huber to withdraw his candidacy .
he agreed to stand for the deputy post again just last week .
zwickel said he could not support such a solution . " today i can definitely say that there will not be a new beginning at ig metall , " said zwickel .
" something i think is urgently needed . " the appointments are expected to be ratified at a special union congress in august . zwickel 's resignation marks the end of his ten-year career at the ig metall helm and of a three-week leadership struggle that came close to tearing the 2.6-million strong metal workers union apart .
it also marked a fight for the future direction of the union .
zwickel , who had planned to step down in october , had hoped to put a reformer in the top spot that could turn the tide at ig metall , which has seen membership decline sharply in the last decade and its influence wane as demands have grown for more flexible wage bargaining . traditionalist jürgen peters is leading figure in the traditionalist camp of the divided union who still supports the ideology of the exploitation of the working class , according to analysts .
he has fiercely opposed any reforms which might been seen as weakening german unions ' traditional strength and collective-bargaining power .
he has been a vocal opponent of chancellor gerhard schröder 's structural reform package that would ease some workers protections and cut welfare for the long-term employed . since joining the union in 1961 , peters has worked his way toward the top .
until the recent strike fiasco , the 59 year old had received high marks for his instincts , tactical skill and ability to play the game of power politics .
even though zwickel opposed his candidacy as chairman back in april , peters was able to mobilize forces among the rank and file and prevail against his own boss . but the failed action in eastern germany for a 35-hour week looked like it could mark the end of his sparkling career .
even those in his own camp criticized him sharply for dragging out a strike that proved highly unpopular with businesses , the government and even the public .
zwickel had accused peters , who is in charge of collective bargaining , of misleading his colleagues about the effects of the strike , which led to shutdowns of auto plants in western germany .
numerous influential union members besides zwickel pushed for him to resign from his deputy position and withdraw his candidacy for the leadership post . peters ignored such entreaties and sat the leadership storm out , working in the background to gather his forces around him .
it was a strategy that worked in the end . long-term effects it is not clear , however , what peters ' victory will mean for the germany 's second-largest union in the long run .
the ascent of a traditionalist could have a negative effect on the german union movement as a whole , say labor analysts . the traditional industry-wide collective-bargaining agreements that german unions have spearheaded for decades are coming under fire as being too inflexible for today 's economy .
some companies are choosing to opt out of collective bargaining agreements , preferring to bypass union leaders and negotiate with workers directly . unions are also suffering from massive membership losses and are increasingly losing their standing among the public , who perceive them as stubbornly blocking structural reform that might pull germany out of its three years of economic stagnation .

1,200 years ago three men set off on a journey from europe to the middle east and back .
today their trip across three cultures and religions is recreated in the aachen exhibit " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . " baghdad and jerusalem .
today the cities conjure up images of armed conflict and religious strife .
for many they are the epitome of the collision between the orient and occident , the battlefields of global interests , where the foreign other is so different and distant from europe .
but a thousand years ago the cities represented the pinnacle of cultural and religious symbiosis and were the choice destination for one of history ’ s lesser-known but certainly more interesting journeys .
the year was 797 in the christian calendar -lrb- 4557 in the jewish and 175 in the muslim dating system -rrb- .
charlemagne , king of the francs , had sent forth two of his envoys and the jewish merchant isaac to the court of harun al rashid , caliph of baghdad .
their mission : establish contact with the ruler of the abbasids and observe the ways of the city on the euphrates .
compared to the town of aachen with its 400 some residents , baghdad was a flourishing metropolis , a renowned place of learning and a melting point for various cultures and religions .
when the envoys departed from charlemagne ’ s court in western germany , the distant lands of the orient were still largely unknown and exotic .
the envoy ’ s route led them first to upper italy , then by ship to the holy city of jerusalem , and from there to baghdad , the seat of the abbasid caliph .
all in all , the men traversed a good portion of the known world at the time , passing through the territories of the three great monotheistic religions : christianity , judaism and islam .
after several months in baghdad , the men embarked on their return journey , laden with gifts , the most impressive of which was a white indian elephant , abu abbas – a symbol of friendship from the muslim caliph to the christian king .
but because the pachyderm was so much slower than a horse , the return voyage turned into an arduous four-year adventure along the southern mediterranean from jerusalem to carthage , where isaac – who was now traveling alone – and abu abbas set sail to italy .
in the spring of 802 , isaac crossed the alps on elephant-back and rode on to aachen in the kingdom of the francs .
today , the story sounds like something straight out of " 1001 arabian nights " and indeed the historical circumstances of the journey are somewhat clouded in legend .
charlemagne ’ s own court chronicler einhart is unusually vague about the envoys ’ journey .
only the return of isaac and the white elephant and their festive reception in aachen ’ s coronation hall on july 20 , 802 , were dutifully recorded in the annals of history .
the rest is left largely up to speculation .
whether or not the men actually stayed at harun al rashid ’ s palace in baghdad , what observations they made and which route they took on their round-trip voyage is still a point of discussion for historians .
near certain , however , is that the entire journey took five years and connected two worlds , the orient and the occident .
follow the elephant it is this centuries-old bridge between the cultures , the link between different religions that serves as the thematic compass for the current exhibit in aachen " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . "
the historical journey from baghdad to aachen via jerusalem winds its way like a red carpet through the exhibit space , guiding visitors through geographically separate locations in aachen , each intended to " recreate " one of the three cities .
ex oriente ’ s overriding themes of inter-cultural dialogue , reciprocal influences and demarcations are superimposed on the rather sketchy historical timeline sprinkled with artifacts garnered from various periods and places along the white elephant ’ s route .
from medieval maps , books and religious manuscripts to tapestry , pottery and jewelry , the exhibit seeks to conjure up the era of charlemagne and the spirit of the journey while juxtaposing it with the tensions of the present day through contemporary art work interspersed throughout the display area .
thus , the visitor is led on a journey through time and space but is at every step of the way conscious of present day limitations , boundaries , and conflicts .
in fact , the visitor is never able to escape these modern road signs , despite the exhibit ’ s attempts to encourage otherwise .
at numerous points on the journey , the visitor is encouraged to " experience the feeling " of baghdad , jerusalem and aachen around 800 , to relive the cultural exchange and the intense blending of various ethnic and religious groups – and yet this is nearly impossible .
at the intersection between cultures , video screens point out that today ’ s trade with the orient rests largely on oil and drugs and that the ancient pilgrimage routes are today ’ s border crossings for refugees and illegal aliens .
over-sized paintings recall the decades of conflict in the middle east while photo montages and installations offer a running commentary on the collision of the religions and the failure to find a lasting peace .
as the exhibit itself proclaims , the combination of historical and contemporary objects intends to provoke the visitor to ask questions about his or her own cultural background and to think about ways to recreate , or better yet emulate , isaac ’ s cultural mission of observing , appreciating and respecting the other .
unfortunately , the visitor leaves wanting to have other more mundane questions addressed like how the elephant survived the northern climate , what political connection charlemagne had with harun al rashid and why isaac ’ s journey never warranted more than a footnote in history books .

germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales . it ’ s summer in germany , the evenings are warm and long and life has taken on a relaxed air .
especially since june .
that ’ s when the german parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays -lrb- till 8 p.m. -rrb- , spelling an end to the nightmarish saturday afternoon rush to buy weekend groceries before 4 p.m.
germany ’ s limited shopping hours , among the most restrictive in the industrialized world , have long been criticized by foreigners for making the shopping experience too stressful .
even domestic retail and industry associations have opined that stringent regulations choke consumer spending and contribute towards the general economic downturn .
first set in stone in 1956 , the law dictating germany 's restrictive shopping hours was last reformed in the 1990s , when lawmakers extended weekday shopping to 8 p.m.
backed by retail associations and industry and strongly opposed by the unions , chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social-democrat-green coalition finally pushed through the amendments in june .
department chains rake in profits less than one month later , the move has already begun to pay off .
retail stores , especially in downtown districts , have begun to profit from the new saturday opening hours .
last week kaufhof warenhäuser ag , one of the country ’ s largest department store chains , registered a marked increase in sales .
a spokesman cited the greater customer turnout on saturdays as the reason .
competing retailer karstadtquelle also reported an overall jump in business on saturdays with a profit increase in the " high two-digit region . "
however , most department chain stores say it ’ s too early to release official figures on their profits .
karstadtquelle spokesman elmar kratz told deutsche welle that customers made use of the new opportunity to shop beyond the earlier limit of 4 p.m. and new customers actually poured in late evening .
he however didn ’ t want to risk concluding the new shopping hours had spurred spending-wary germans to splurge .
relaxed and leisurely shopping but kratz added the atmosphere was distinctly more relaxed and hassle-free .
" the stores are all reporting the same : the shopping experience is clearly more relaxed , the customers come without time pressures .
after all , before june when shops closed at 4 p.m. , the customers had to be forced out of the shops and at the time they argued ‘ i have time now , i want to shop and you ’ re closing the shop , ’ " he said .
kratz said customers making use of the longer opening hours mainly consisted of families .
clothing were the fastest-selling items - including summer apparel , swimwear and children ’ s fashions .
less enthusiasm in southern states but retail associations have reported that not all germans are making use of the " shop longer saturdays . "
according to the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- shoppers enthusiastically spilled out onto the sidewalks of cities such as düsseldorf , kiel , hamburg and leipzig to shop in the weeks since the " shop till you drop saturdays " were introduced .
but the atmosphere has been more subdued in southern germany .
shopping meccas such as munich and stuttgart remained relatively calm and immune from the shopping frenzy apparent in other parts of the country on saturdays .
the same disinterest is also evident in smaller retail shops that still close early despite the opportunity to stay open longer .
karin wiethege , who works in a small specialty shop selling exclusive gift items such as soap and perfumes from the french region of provence on the outskirts of bonn , told deutsche welle she could n't possibly remain in the shop till 8 p.m.
besides , she said , she understood the displeasure of her colleagues regarding longer working hours .
" sure , i understand that .
i would also protest .
if this shop here also remained open till 8 p.m. , i would say : ‘ i ’ m not coming anymore .
my family is too important to me for that . "
no new jobs but creating new jobs to avoid disgruntled employees does n't seem to have been the antidote so far . elmar kratz of karstadtquelle said further jobs weren ’ t planned .
" we ’ re trying to work it out so that employees ’ work routines are adjusted to the new timings .
when there are many customers , there are more employees , when there are less customers , naturally there are less employees – that ’ s how we ’ ve regulated it to start with . "
but while the industry might still be waiting for the expected economic benefits and jobs to materialize from the extended shop opening hours , there ’ s no denying that shopping in germany actually means no more nerve-jangling , shove-jostle-wait matches for groceries on saturday afternoons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .
his departure marks a defeat for modernists at europe 's largest industrial union . klaus zwickel , 64 , has never been secretive about his differences with deputy chairman jürgen peters .
but since an abortive strike last month in eastern germany over working hours , zwickel had gone on the offensive , blaming peters ' old-school tactics for pitting the public against the union and handing ig metall its worst defeat since 1954 . what followed was a public mud-slinging match that had each side accusing the other of mean-spiritedness and ad hominem attacks .
zwickel repeatedly urged peters to resign .
peters held his ground and went on the counteroffensive . on monday morning , zwickel conceded defeat .
at a press conference in frankfurt , he said he was stepping down immediately , before his planned retirement in october .
but he refused to completely shoulder the blame for the failed labor action in june and fired a final shot at his designated successor . " with this step , i do n't take sole responsibility , " said zwickel .
" the main responsibility for the failed strike is with the deputy chairman and the regional leader for berlin , brandenburg and saxony . " he added : " at no point have they shown a willingness to accept personal consequences for the situation . " two at the top despite his best efforts , zwickel had failed in securing support for another leadership constellation and announced that a " tandem solution " will likely be put in place : peters will lead the union along with berthold huber , a regional leader from the federal state of baden-württemberg -lrb- photo , huber left -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall board had tapped the two men for the post-zwickel leadership positions in april , but the subsequent internal strife led huber to withdraw his candidacy .
he agreed to stand for the deputy post again just last week .
zwickel said he could not support such a solution . " today i can definitely say that there will not be a new beginning at ig metall , " said zwickel .
" something i think is urgently needed . " the appointments are expected to be ratified at a special union congress in august . zwickel 's resignation marks the end of his ten-year career at the ig metall helm and of a three-week leadership struggle that came close to tearing the 2.6-million strong metal workers union apart .
it also marked a fight for the future direction of the union .
zwickel , who had planned to step down in october , had hoped to put a reformer in the top spot that could turn the tide at ig metall , which has seen membership decline sharply in the last decade and its influence wane as demands have grown for more flexible wage bargaining . traditionalist jürgen peters is leading figure in the traditionalist camp of the divided union who still supports the ideology of the exploitation of the working class , according to analysts .
he has fiercely opposed any reforms which might been seen as weakening german unions ' traditional strength and collective-bargaining power .
he has been a vocal opponent of chancellor gerhard schröder 's structural reform package that would ease some workers protections and cut welfare for the long-term employed . since joining the union in 1961 , peters has worked his way toward the top .
until the recent strike fiasco , the 59 year old had received high marks for his instincts , tactical skill and ability to play the game of power politics .
even though zwickel opposed his candidacy as chairman back in april , peters was able to mobilize forces among the rank and file and prevail against his own boss . but the failed action in eastern germany for a 35-hour week looked like it could mark the end of his sparkling career .
even those in his own camp criticized him sharply for dragging out a strike that proved highly unpopular with businesses , the government and even the public .
zwickel had accused peters , who is in charge of collective bargaining , of misleading his colleagues about the effects of the strike , which led to shutdowns of auto plants in western germany .
numerous influential union members besides zwickel pushed for him to resign from his deputy position and withdraw his candidacy for the leadership post . peters ignored such entreaties and sat the leadership storm out , working in the background to gather his forces around him .
it was a strategy that worked in the end . long-term effects it is not clear , however , what peters ' victory will mean for the germany 's second-largest union in the long run .
the ascent of a traditionalist could have a negative effect on the german union movement as a whole , say labor analysts . the traditional industry-wide collective-bargaining agreements that german unions have spearheaded for decades are coming under fire as being too inflexible for today 's economy .
some companies are choosing to opt out of collective bargaining agreements , preferring to bypass union leaders and negotiate with workers directly . unions are also suffering from massive membership losses and are increasingly losing their standing among the public , who perceive them as stubbornly blocking structural reform that might pull germany out of its three years of economic stagnation .

the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .
his departure marks a defeat for modernists at europe 's largest industrial union . klaus zwickel , 64 , has never been secretive about his differences with deputy chairman jürgen peters .
but since an abortive strike last month in eastern germany over working hours , zwickel had gone on the offensive , blaming peters ' old-school tactics for pitting the public against the union and handing ig metall its worst defeat since 1954 . what followed was a public mud-slinging match that had each side accusing the other of mean-spiritedness and ad hominem attacks .
zwickel repeatedly urged peters to resign .
peters held his ground and went on the counteroffensive . on monday morning , zwickel conceded defeat .
at a press conference in frankfurt , he said he was stepping down immediately , before his planned retirement in october .
but he refused to completely shoulder the blame for the failed labor action in june and fired a final shot at his designated successor . " with this step , i do n't take sole responsibility , " said zwickel .
" the main responsibility for the failed strike is with the deputy chairman and the regional leader for berlin , brandenburg and saxony . " he added : " at no point have they shown a willingness to accept personal consequences for the situation . " two at the top despite his best efforts , zwickel had failed in securing support for another leadership constellation and announced that a " tandem solution " will likely be put in place : peters will lead the union along with berthold huber , a regional leader from the federal state of baden-württemberg -lrb- photo , huber left -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall board had tapped the two men for the post-zwickel leadership positions in april , but the subsequent internal strife led huber to withdraw his candidacy .
he agreed to stand for the deputy post again just last week .
zwickel said he could not support such a solution . " today i can definitely say that there will not be a new beginning at ig metall , " said zwickel .
" something i think is urgently needed . " the appointments are expected to be ratified at a special union congress in august . zwickel 's resignation marks the end of his ten-year career at the ig metall helm and of a three-week leadership struggle that came close to tearing the 2.6-million strong metal workers union apart .
it also marked a fight for the future direction of the union .
zwickel , who had planned to step down in october , had hoped to put a reformer in the top spot that could turn the tide at ig metall , which has seen membership decline sharply in the last decade and its influence wane as demands have grown for more flexible wage bargaining . traditionalist jürgen peters is leading figure in the traditionalist camp of the divided union who still supports the ideology of the exploitation of the working class , according to analysts .
he has fiercely opposed any reforms which might been seen as weakening german unions ' traditional strength and collective-bargaining power .
he has been a vocal opponent of chancellor gerhard schröder 's structural reform package that would ease some workers protections and cut welfare for the long-term employed . since joining the union in 1961 , peters has worked his way toward the top .
until the recent strike fiasco , the 59 year old had received high marks for his instincts , tactical skill and ability to play the game of power politics .
even though zwickel opposed his candidacy as chairman back in april , peters was able to mobilize forces among the rank and file and prevail against his own boss . but the failed action in eastern germany for a 35-hour week looked like it could mark the end of his sparkling career .
even those in his own camp criticized him sharply for dragging out a strike that proved highly unpopular with businesses , the government and even the public .
zwickel had accused peters , who is in charge of collective bargaining , of misleading his colleagues about the effects of the strike , which led to shutdowns of auto plants in western germany .
numerous influential union members besides zwickel pushed for him to resign from his deputy position and withdraw his candidacy for the leadership post . peters ignored such entreaties and sat the leadership storm out , working in the background to gather his forces around him .
it was a strategy that worked in the end . long-term effects it is not clear , however , what peters ' victory will mean for the germany 's second-largest union in the long run .
the ascent of a traditionalist could have a negative effect on the german union movement as a whole , say labor analysts . the traditional industry-wide collective-bargaining agreements that german unions have spearheaded for decades are coming under fire as being too inflexible for today 's economy .
some companies are choosing to opt out of collective bargaining agreements , preferring to bypass union leaders and negotiate with workers directly . unions are also suffering from massive membership losses and are increasingly losing their standing among the public , who perceive them as stubbornly blocking structural reform that might pull germany out of its three years of economic stagnation .

1,200 years ago three men set off on a journey from europe to the middle east and back .
today their trip across three cultures and religions is recreated in the aachen exhibit " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . " baghdad and jerusalem .
today the cities conjure up images of armed conflict and religious strife .
for many they are the epitome of the collision between the orient and occident , the battlefields of global interests , where the foreign other is so different and distant from europe .
but a thousand years ago the cities represented the pinnacle of cultural and religious symbiosis and were the choice destination for one of history ’ s lesser-known but certainly more interesting journeys .
the year was 797 in the christian calendar -lrb- 4557 in the jewish and 175 in the muslim dating system -rrb- .
charlemagne , king of the francs , had sent forth two of his envoys and the jewish merchant isaac to the court of harun al rashid , caliph of baghdad .
their mission : establish contact with the ruler of the abbasids and observe the ways of the city on the euphrates .
compared to the town of aachen with its 400 some residents , baghdad was a flourishing metropolis , a renowned place of learning and a melting point for various cultures and religions .
when the envoys departed from charlemagne ’ s court in western germany , the distant lands of the orient were still largely unknown and exotic .
the envoy ’ s route led them first to upper italy , then by ship to the holy city of jerusalem , and from there to baghdad , the seat of the abbasid caliph .
all in all , the men traversed a good portion of the known world at the time , passing through the territories of the three great monotheistic religions : christianity , judaism and islam .
after several months in baghdad , the men embarked on their return journey , laden with gifts , the most impressive of which was a white indian elephant , abu abbas – a symbol of friendship from the muslim caliph to the christian king .
but because the pachyderm was so much slower than a horse , the return voyage turned into an arduous four-year adventure along the southern mediterranean from jerusalem to carthage , where isaac – who was now traveling alone – and abu abbas set sail to italy .
in the spring of 802 , isaac crossed the alps on elephant-back and rode on to aachen in the kingdom of the francs .
today , the story sounds like something straight out of " 1001 arabian nights " and indeed the historical circumstances of the journey are somewhat clouded in legend .
charlemagne ’ s own court chronicler einhart is unusually vague about the envoys ’ journey .
only the return of isaac and the white elephant and their festive reception in aachen ’ s coronation hall on july 20 , 802 , were dutifully recorded in the annals of history .
the rest is left largely up to speculation .
whether or not the men actually stayed at harun al rashid ’ s palace in baghdad , what observations they made and which route they took on their round-trip voyage is still a point of discussion for historians .
near certain , however , is that the entire journey took five years and connected two worlds , the orient and the occident .
follow the elephant it is this centuries-old bridge between the cultures , the link between different religions that serves as the thematic compass for the current exhibit in aachen " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . "
the historical journey from baghdad to aachen via jerusalem winds its way like a red carpet through the exhibit space , guiding visitors through geographically separate locations in aachen , each intended to " recreate " one of the three cities .
ex oriente ’ s overriding themes of inter-cultural dialogue , reciprocal influences and demarcations are superimposed on the rather sketchy historical timeline sprinkled with artifacts garnered from various periods and places along the white elephant ’ s route .
from medieval maps , books and religious manuscripts to tapestry , pottery and jewelry , the exhibit seeks to conjure up the era of charlemagne and the spirit of the journey while juxtaposing it with the tensions of the present day through contemporary art work interspersed throughout the display area .
thus , the visitor is led on a journey through time and space but is at every step of the way conscious of present day limitations , boundaries , and conflicts .
in fact , the visitor is never able to escape these modern road signs , despite the exhibit ’ s attempts to encourage otherwise .
at numerous points on the journey , the visitor is encouraged to " experience the feeling " of baghdad , jerusalem and aachen around 800 , to relive the cultural exchange and the intense blending of various ethnic and religious groups – and yet this is nearly impossible .
at the intersection between cultures , video screens point out that today ’ s trade with the orient rests largely on oil and drugs and that the ancient pilgrimage routes are today ’ s border crossings for refugees and illegal aliens .
over-sized paintings recall the decades of conflict in the middle east while photo montages and installations offer a running commentary on the collision of the religions and the failure to find a lasting peace .
as the exhibit itself proclaims , the combination of historical and contemporary objects intends to provoke the visitor to ask questions about his or her own cultural background and to think about ways to recreate , or better yet emulate , isaac ’ s cultural mission of observing , appreciating and respecting the other .
unfortunately , the visitor leaves wanting to have other more mundane questions addressed like how the elephant survived the northern climate , what political connection charlemagne had with harun al rashid and why isaac ’ s journey never warranted more than a footnote in history books .
but then again maybe these rather pointed historical questions can serve as the departure point for further investigations into inter-cultural history , because such travels certainly weren ’ t limited to charlemagne ’ s period .
and in the end it might just be the curious pursuers of historical facts who , in the exhibit ’ s frequently quoted words of aristotle , wonder and marvel and thereby create the basis for all quests of knowledge and understanding .
in the case of " ex oriente , " it is the visitor who leaves the exhibit enchanted with the concept of documenting a 1,200 year old journey and questions its relevance to today 's realities .

germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales . it ’ s summer in germany , the evenings are warm and long and life has taken on a relaxed air .
especially since june .
that ’ s when the german parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays -lrb- till 8 p.m. -rrb- , spelling an end to the nightmarish saturday afternoon rush to buy weekend groceries before 4 p.m.
germany ’ s limited shopping hours , among the most restrictive in the industrialized world , have long been criticized by foreigners for making the shopping experience too stressful .
even domestic retail and industry associations have opined that stringent regulations choke consumer spending and contribute towards the general economic downturn .
first set in stone in 1956 , the law dictating germany 's restrictive shopping hours was last reformed in the 1990s , when lawmakers extended weekday shopping to 8 p.m.
backed by retail associations and industry and strongly opposed by the unions , chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social-democrat-green coalition finally pushed through the amendments in june .
department chains rake in profits less than one month later , the move has already begun to pay off .
retail stores , especially in downtown districts , have begun to profit from the new saturday opening hours .
last week kaufhof warenhäuser ag , one of the country ’ s largest department store chains , registered a marked increase in sales .
a spokesman cited the greater customer turnout on saturdays as the reason .
competing retailer karstadtquelle also reported an overall jump in business on saturdays with a profit increase in the " high two-digit region . "
however , most department chain stores say it ’ s too early to release official figures on their profits .
karstadtquelle spokesman elmar kratz told deutsche welle that customers made use of the new opportunity to shop beyond the earlier limit of 4 p.m. and new customers actually poured in late evening .
he however didn ’ t want to risk concluding the new shopping hours had spurred spending-wary germans to splurge .
relaxed and leisurely shopping but kratz added the atmosphere was distinctly more relaxed and hassle-free .
" the stores are all reporting the same : the shopping experience is clearly more relaxed , the customers come without time pressures .
after all , before june when shops closed at 4 p.m. , the customers had to be forced out of the shops and at the time they argued ‘ i have time now , i want to shop and you ’ re closing the shop , ’ " he said .
kratz said customers making use of the longer opening hours mainly consisted of families .
clothing were the fastest-selling items - including summer apparel , swimwear and children ’ s fashions .
less enthusiasm in southern states but retail associations have reported that not all germans are making use of the " shop longer saturdays . "
according to the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- shoppers enthusiastically spilled out onto the sidewalks of cities such as düsseldorf , kiel , hamburg and leipzig to shop in the weeks since the " shop till you drop saturdays " were introduced .
but the atmosphere has been more subdued in southern germany .
shopping meccas such as munich and stuttgart remained relatively calm and immune from the shopping frenzy apparent in other parts of the country on saturdays .
the same disinterest is also evident in smaller retail shops that still close early despite the opportunity to stay open longer .
karin wiethege , who works in a small specialty shop selling exclusive gift items such as soap and perfumes from the french region of provence on the outskirts of bonn , told deutsche welle she could n't possibly remain in the shop till 8 p.m.
besides , she said , she understood the displeasure of her colleagues regarding longer working hours .
" sure , i understand that .
i would also protest .
if this shop here also remained open till 8 p.m. , i would say : ‘ i ’ m not coming anymore .
my family is too important to me for that . "
no new jobs but creating new jobs to avoid disgruntled employees does n't seem to have been the antidote so far . elmar kratz of karstadtquelle said further jobs weren ’ t planned .
" we ’ re trying to work it out so that employees ’ work routines are adjusted to the new timings .
when there are many customers , there are more employees , when there are less customers , naturally there are less employees – that ’ s how we ’ ve regulated it to start with . "
but while the industry might still be waiting for the expected economic benefits and jobs to materialize from the extended shop opening hours , there ’ s no denying that shopping in germany actually means no more nerve-jangling , shove-jostle-wait matches for groceries on saturday afternoons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales . it ’ s summer in germany , the evenings are warm and long and life has taken on a relaxed air .
especially since june .
that ’ s when the german parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays -lrb- till 8 p.m. -rrb- , spelling an end to the nightmarish saturday afternoon rush to buy weekend groceries before 4 p.m.
germany ’ s limited shopping hours , among the most restrictive in the industrialized world , have long been criticized by foreigners for making the shopping experience too stressful .
even domestic retail and industry associations have opined that stringent regulations choke consumer spending and contribute towards the general economic downturn .

department chains rake in profits less than one month later , the move has already begun to pay off .
retail stores , especially in downtown districts , have begun to profit from the new saturday opening hours .
last week kaufhof warenhäuser ag , one of the country ’ s largest department store chains , registered a marked increase in sales .
a spokesman cited the greater customer turnout on saturdays as the reason .
competing retailer karstadtquelle also reported an overall jump in business on saturdays with a profit increase in the " high two-digit region . "
however , most department chain stores say it ’ s too early to release official figures on their profits .
karstadtquelle spokesman elmar kratz told deutsche welle that customers made use of the new opportunity to shop beyond the earlier limit of 4 p.m. and new customers actually poured in late evening .
he however didn ’ t want to risk concluding the new shopping hours had spurred spending-wary germans to splurge .
relaxed and leisurely shopping but kratz added the atmosphere was distinctly more relaxed and hassle-free .
" the stores are all reporting the same : the shopping experience is clearly more relaxed , the customers come without time pressures .
after all , before june when shops closed at 4 p.m. , the customers had to be forced out of the shops and at the time they argued ‘ i have time now , i want to shop and you ’ re closing the shop , ’ " he said .
kratz said customers making use of the longer opening hours mainly consisted of families .
clothing were the fastest-selling items - including summer apparel , swimwear and children ’ s fashions .

karin wiethege , who works in a small specialty shop selling exclusive gift items such as soap and perfumes from the french region of provence on the outskirts of bonn , told deutsche welle she could n't possibly remain in the shop till 8 p.m.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.07.2003 baghdad , jerusalem , aachen - on the trail of the white elephant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 802 , a jewish merchant brought back a white indian elephant from baghdad to the court of charlemagne in aachen .
1,200 years ago three men set off on a journey from europe to the middle east and back .
today their trip across three cultures and religions is recreated in the aachen exhibit " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . " baghdad and jerusalem .
today the cities conjure up images of armed conflict and religious strife .
for many they are the epitome of the collision between the orient and occident , the battlefields of global interests , where the foreign other is so different and distant from europe .
but a thousand years ago the cities represented the pinnacle of cultural and religious symbiosis and were the choice destination for one of history ’ s lesser-known but certainly more interesting journeys .
the year was 797 in the christian calendar -lrb- 4557 in the jewish and 175 in the muslim dating system -rrb- .
charlemagne , king of the francs , had sent forth two of his envoys and the jewish merchant isaac to the court of harun al rashid , caliph of baghdad .
their mission : establish contact with the ruler of the abbasids and observe the ways of the city on the euphrates .
compared to the town of aachen with its 400 some residents , baghdad was a flourishing metropolis , a renowned place of learning and a melting point for various cultures and religions .
when the envoys departed from charlemagne ’ s court in western germany , the distant lands of the orient were still largely unknown and exotic .
the envoy ’ s route led them first to upper italy , then by ship to the holy city of jerusalem , and from there to baghdad , the seat of the abbasid caliph .
all in all , the men traversed a good portion of the known world at the time , passing through the territories of the three great monotheistic religions : christianity , judaism and islam .
after several months in baghdad , the men embarked on their return journey , laden with gifts , the most impressive of which was a white indian elephant , abu abbas – a symbol of friendship from the muslim caliph to the christian king .
but because the pachyderm was so much slower than a horse , the return voyage turned into an arduous four-year adventure along the southern mediterranean from jerusalem to carthage , where isaac – who was now traveling alone – and abu abbas set sail to italy .
in the spring of 802 , isaac crossed the alps on elephant-back and rode on to aachen in the kingdom of the francs .
today , the story sounds like something straight out of " 1001 arabian nights " and indeed the historical circumstances of the journey are somewhat clouded in legend .
charlemagne ’ s own court chronicler einhart is unusually vague about the envoys ’ journey .
only the return of isaac and the white elephant and their festive reception in aachen ’ s coronation hall on july 20 , 802 , were dutifully recorded in the annals of history .
the rest is left largely up to speculation .
whether or not the men actually stayed at harun al rashid ’ s palace in baghdad , what observations they made and which route they took on their round-trip voyage is still a point of discussion for historians .
near certain , however , is that the entire journey took five years and connected two worlds , the orient and the occident .
follow the elephant it is this centuries-old bridge between the cultures , the link between different religions that serves as the thematic compass for the current exhibit in aachen " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . "
the historical journey from baghdad to aachen via jerusalem winds its way like a red carpet through the exhibit space , guiding visitors through geographically separate locations in aachen , each intended to " recreate " one of the three cities .
ex oriente ’ s overriding themes of inter-cultural dialogue , reciprocal influences and demarcations are superimposed on the rather sketchy historical timeline sprinkled with artifacts garnered from various periods and places along the white elephant ’ s route .
from medieval maps , books and religious manuscripts to tapestry , pottery and jewelry , the exhibit seeks to conjure up the era of charlemagne and the spirit of the journey while juxtaposing it with the tensions of the present day through contemporary art work interspersed throughout the display area .
thus , the visitor is led on a journey through time and space but is at every step of the way conscious of present day limitations , boundaries , and conflicts .
in fact , the visitor is never able to escape these modern road signs , despite the exhibit ’ s attempts to encourage otherwise .
at numerous points on the journey , the visitor is encouraged to " experience the feeling " of baghdad , jerusalem and aachen around 800 , to relive the cultural exchange and the intense blending of various ethnic and religious groups – and yet this is nearly impossible .
at the intersection between cultures , video screens point out that today ’ s trade with the orient rests largely on oil and drugs and that the ancient pilgrimage routes are today ’ s border crossings for refugees and illegal aliens .
over-sized paintings recall the decades of conflict in the middle east while photo montages and installations offer a running commentary on the collision of the religions and the failure to find a lasting peace .
as the exhibit itself proclaims , the combination of historical and contemporary objects intends to provoke the visitor to ask questions about his or her own cultural background and to think about ways to recreate , or better yet emulate , isaac ’ s cultural mission of observing , appreciating and respecting the other .
unfortunately , the visitor leaves wanting to have other more mundane questions addressed like how the elephant survived the northern climate , what political connection charlemagne had with harun al rashid and why isaac ’ s journey never warranted more than a footnote in history books .
but then again maybe these rather pointed historical questions can serve as the departure point for further investigations into inter-cultural history , because such travels certainly weren ’ t limited to charlemagne ’ s period .
and in the end it might just be the curious pursuers of historical facts who , in the exhibit ’ s frequently quoted words of aristotle , wonder and marvel and thereby create the basis for all quests of knowledge and understanding .
in the case of " ex oriente , " it is the visitor who leaves the exhibit enchanted with the concept of documenting a 1,200 year old journey and questions its relevance to today 's realities .

germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales . it ’ s summer in germany , the evenings are warm and long and life has taken on a relaxed air .
especially since june .
that ’ s when the german parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays -lrb- till 8 p.m. -rrb- , spelling an end to the nightmarish saturday afternoon rush to buy weekend groceries before 4 p.m.
germany ’ s limited shopping hours , among the most restrictive in the industrialized world , have long been criticized by foreigners for making the shopping experience too stressful .
even domestic retail and industry associations have opined that stringent regulations choke consumer spending and contribute towards the general economic downturn .
first set in stone in 1956 , the law dictating germany 's restrictive shopping hours was last reformed in the 1990s , when lawmakers extended weekday shopping to 8 p.m.
backed by retail associations and industry and strongly opposed by the unions , chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social-democrat-green coalition finally pushed through the amendments in june .
department chains rake in profits less than one month later , the move has already begun to pay off .
retail stores , especially in downtown districts , have begun to profit from the new saturday opening hours .
last week kaufhof warenhäuser ag , one of the country ’ s largest department store chains , registered a marked increase in sales .
a spokesman cited the greater customer turnout on saturdays as the reason .
competing retailer karstadtquelle also reported an overall jump in business on saturdays with a profit increase in the " high two-digit region . "
however , most department chain stores say it ’ s too early to release official figures on their profits .
karstadtquelle spokesman elmar kratz told deutsche welle that customers made use of the new opportunity to shop beyond the earlier limit of 4 p.m. and new customers actually poured in late evening .
he however didn ’ t want to risk concluding the new shopping hours had spurred spending-wary germans to splurge .
relaxed and leisurely shopping but kratz added the atmosphere was distinctly more relaxed and hassle-free .
" the stores are all reporting the same : the shopping experience is clearly more relaxed , the customers come without time pressures .
after all , before june when shops closed at 4 p.m. , the customers had to be forced out of the shops and at the time they argued ‘ i have time now , i want to shop and you ’ re closing the shop , ’ " he said .
kratz said customers making use of the longer opening hours mainly consisted of families .
clothing were the fastest-selling items - including summer apparel , swimwear and children ’ s fashions .
less enthusiasm in southern states but retail associations have reported that not all germans are making use of the " shop longer saturdays . "
according to the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- shoppers enthusiastically spilled out onto the sidewalks of cities such as düsseldorf , kiel , hamburg and leipzig to shop in the weeks since the " shop till you drop saturdays " were introduced .
but the atmosphere has been more subdued in southern germany .

the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .
his departure marks a defeat for modernists at europe 's largest industrial union . klaus zwickel , 64 , has never been secretive about his differences with deputy chairman jürgen peters .
but since an abortive strike last month in eastern germany over working hours , zwickel had gone on the offensive , blaming peters ' old-school tactics for pitting the public against the union and handing ig metall its worst defeat since 1954 . what followed was a public mud-slinging match that had each side accusing the other of mean-spiritedness and ad hominem attacks .
zwickel repeatedly urged peters to resign .
peters held his ground and went on the counteroffensive . on monday morning , zwickel conceded defeat .
at a press conference in frankfurt , he said he was stepping down immediately , before his planned retirement in october .
but he refused to completely shoulder the blame for the failed labor action in june and fired a final shot at his designated successor . " with this step , i do n't take sole responsibility , " said zwickel .
" the main responsibility for the failed strike is with the deputy chairman and the regional leader for berlin , brandenburg and saxony . " he added : " at no point have they shown a willingness to accept personal consequences for the situation . " two at the top despite his best efforts , zwickel had failed in securing support for another leadership constellation and announced that a " tandem solution " will likely be put in place : peters will lead the union along with berthold huber , a regional leader from the federal state of baden-württemberg -lrb- photo , huber left -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall board had tapped the two men for the post-zwickel leadership positions in april , but the subsequent internal strife led huber to withdraw his candidacy .
he agreed to stand for the deputy post again just last week .
zwickel said he could not support such a solution . " today i can definitely say that there will not be a new beginning at ig metall , " said zwickel .
" something i think is urgently needed . " the appointments are expected to be ratified at a special union congress in august . zwickel 's resignation marks the end of his ten-year career at the ig metall helm and of a three-week leadership struggle that came close to tearing the 2.6-million strong metal workers union apart .
it also marked a fight for the future direction of the union .
zwickel , who had planned to step down in october , had hoped to put a reformer in the top spot that could turn the tide at ig metall , which has seen membership decline sharply in the last decade and its influence wane as demands have grown for more flexible wage bargaining . traditionalist jürgen peters is leading figure in the traditionalist camp of the divided union who still supports the ideology of the exploitation of the working class , according to analysts .
he has fiercely opposed any reforms which might been seen as weakening german unions ' traditional strength and collective-bargaining power .
he has been a vocal opponent of chancellor gerhard schröder 's structural reform package that would ease some workers protections and cut welfare for the long-term employed . since joining the union in 1961 , peters has worked his way toward the top .
until the recent strike fiasco , the 59 year old had received high marks for his instincts , tactical skill and ability to play the game of power politics .
even though zwickel opposed his candidacy as chairman back in april , peters was able to mobilize forces among the rank and file and prevail against his own boss . but the failed action in eastern germany for a 35-hour week looked like it could mark the end of his sparkling career .
even those in his own camp criticized him sharply for dragging out a strike that proved highly unpopular with businesses , the government and even the public .
zwickel had accused peters , who is in charge of collective bargaining , of misleading his colleagues about the effects of the strike , which led to shutdowns of auto plants in western germany .
numerous influential union members besides zwickel pushed for him to resign from his deputy position and withdraw his candidacy for the leadership post . peters ignored such entreaties and sat the leadership storm out , working in the background to gather his forces around him .
it was a strategy that worked in the end . long-term effects it is not clear , however , what peters ' victory will mean for the germany 's second-largest union in the long run .
the ascent of a traditionalist could have a negative effect on the german union movement as a whole , say labor analysts . the traditional industry-wide collective-bargaining agreements that german unions have spearheaded for decades are coming under fire as being too inflexible for today 's economy .
some companies are choosing to opt out of collective bargaining agreements , preferring to bypass union leaders and negotiate with workers directly . unions are also suffering from massive membership losses and are increasingly losing their standing among the public , who perceive them as stubbornly blocking structural reform that might pull germany out of its three years of economic stagnation .

dw-world asked a leading labor expert whether ig metall 's malaise could spread .

that ’ s when the german parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays -lrb- till 8 p.m. -rrb- , spelling an end to the nightmarish saturday afternoon rush to buy weekend groceries before 4 p.m.
germany ’ s limited shopping hours , among the most restrictive in the industrialized world , have long been criticized by foreigners for making the shopping experience too stressful .
even domestic retail and industry associations have opined that stringent regulations choke consumer spending and contribute towards the general economic downturn .
first set in stone in 1956 , the law dictating germany 's restrictive shopping hours was last reformed in the 1990s , when lawmakers extended weekday shopping to 8 p.m.
backed by retail associations and industry and strongly opposed by the unions , chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social-democrat-green coalition finally pushed through the amendments in june .
department chains rake in profits less than one month later , the move has already begun to pay off .
retail stores , especially in downtown districts , have begun to profit from the new saturday opening hours .
last week kaufhof warenhäuser ag , one of the country ’ s largest department store chains , registered a marked increase in sales .
a spokesman cited the greater customer turnout on saturdays as the reason .
competing retailer karstadtquelle also reported an overall jump in business on saturdays with a profit increase in the " high two-digit region . "
however , most department chain stores say it ’ s too early to release official figures on their profits .
karstadtquelle spokesman elmar kratz told deutsche welle that customers made use of the new opportunity to shop beyond the earlier limit of 4 p.m. and new customers actually poured in late evening .
he however didn ’ t want to risk concluding the new shopping hours had spurred spending-wary germans to splurge .
relaxed and leisurely shopping but kratz added the atmosphere was distinctly more relaxed and hassle-free .
" the stores are all reporting the same : the shopping experience is clearly more relaxed , the customers come without time pressures .
after all , before june when shops closed at 4 p.m. , the customers had to be forced out of the shops and at the time they argued ‘ i have time now , i want to shop and you ’ re closing the shop , ’ " he said .
kratz said customers making use of the longer opening hours mainly consisted of families .
clothing were the fastest-selling items - including summer apparel , swimwear and children ’ s fashions .
less enthusiasm in southern states but retail associations have reported that not all germans are making use of the " shop longer saturdays . "
according to the german retailers ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- shoppers enthusiastically spilled out onto the sidewalks of cities such as düsseldorf , kiel , hamburg and leipzig to shop in the weeks since the " shop till you drop saturdays " were introduced .
but the atmosphere has been more subdued in southern germany .
shopping meccas such as munich and stuttgart remained relatively calm and immune from the shopping frenzy apparent in other parts of the country on saturdays .
the same disinterest is also evident in smaller retail shops that still close early despite the opportunity to stay open longer .
karin wiethege , who works in a small specialty shop selling exclusive gift items such as soap and perfumes from the french region of provence on the outskirts of bonn , told deutsche welle she could n't possibly remain in the shop till 8 p.m.
besides , she said , she understood the displeasure of her colleagues regarding longer working hours .
" sure , i understand that .
i would also protest .
if this shop here also remained open till 8 p.m. , i would say : ‘ i ’ m not coming anymore .
my family is too important to me for that . "
no new jobs but creating new jobs to avoid disgruntled employees does n't seem to have been the antidote so far . elmar kratz of karstadtquelle said further jobs weren ’ t planned .
" we ’ re trying to work it out so that employees ’ work routines are adjusted to the new timings .
when there are many customers , there are more employees , when there are less customers , naturally there are less employees – that ’ s how we ’ ve regulated it to start with . "

1,200 years ago three men set off on a journey from europe to the middle east and back .
today their trip across three cultures and religions is recreated in the aachen exhibit " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . " baghdad and jerusalem .
today the cities conjure up images of armed conflict and religious strife .
for many they are the epitome of the collision between the orient and occident , the battlefields of global interests , where the foreign other is so different and distant from europe .
but a thousand years ago the cities represented the pinnacle of cultural and religious symbiosis and were the choice destination for one of history ’ s lesser-known but certainly more interesting journeys .
the year was 797 in the christian calendar -lrb- 4557 in the jewish and 175 in the muslim dating system -rrb- .
charlemagne , king of the francs , had sent forth two of his envoys and the jewish merchant isaac to the court of harun al rashid , caliph of baghdad .
their mission : establish contact with the ruler of the abbasids and observe the ways of the city on the euphrates .
compared to the town of aachen with its 400 some residents , baghdad was a flourishing metropolis , a renowned place of learning and a melting point for various cultures and religions .
when the envoys departed from charlemagne ’ s court in western germany , the distant lands of the orient were still largely unknown and exotic .
the envoy ’ s route led them first to upper italy , then by ship to the holy city of jerusalem , and from there to baghdad , the seat of the abbasid caliph .
all in all , the men traversed a good portion of the known world at the time , passing through the territories of the three great monotheistic religions : christianity , judaism and islam .
after several months in baghdad , the men embarked on their return journey , laden with gifts , the most impressive of which was a white indian elephant , abu abbas – a symbol of friendship from the muslim caliph to the christian king .
but because the pachyderm was so much slower than a horse , the return voyage turned into an arduous four-year adventure along the southern mediterranean from jerusalem to carthage , where isaac – who was now traveling alone – and abu abbas set sail to italy .
in the spring of 802 , isaac crossed the alps on elephant-back and rode on to aachen in the kingdom of the francs .
today , the story sounds like something straight out of " 1001 arabian nights " and indeed the historical circumstances of the journey are somewhat clouded in legend .
charlemagne ’ s own court chronicler einhart is unusually vague about the envoys ’ journey .
only the return of isaac and the white elephant and their festive reception in aachen ’ s coronation hall on july 20 , 802 , were dutifully recorded in the annals of history .
the rest is left largely up to speculation .
whether or not the men actually stayed at harun al rashid ’ s palace in baghdad , what observations they made and which route they took on their round-trip voyage is still a point of discussion for historians .
near certain , however , is that the entire journey took five years and connected two worlds , the orient and the occident .
follow the elephant it is this centuries-old bridge between the cultures , the link between different religions that serves as the thematic compass for the current exhibit in aachen " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . "
the historical journey from baghdad to aachen via jerusalem winds its way like a red carpet through the exhibit space , guiding visitors through geographically separate locations in aachen , each intended to " recreate " one of the three cities .
ex oriente ’ s overriding themes of inter-cultural dialogue , reciprocal influences and demarcations are superimposed on the rather sketchy historical timeline sprinkled with artifacts garnered from various periods and places along the white elephant ’ s route .
from medieval maps , books and religious manuscripts to tapestry , pottery and jewelry , the exhibit seeks to conjure up the era of charlemagne and the spirit of the journey while juxtaposing it with the tensions of the present day through contemporary art work interspersed throughout the display area .
thus , the visitor is led on a journey through time and space but is at every step of the way conscious of present day limitations , boundaries , and conflicts .
in fact , the visitor is never able to escape these modern road signs , despite the exhibit ’ s attempts to encourage otherwise .
at numerous points on the journey , the visitor is encouraged to " experience the feeling " of baghdad , jerusalem and aachen around 800 , to relive the cultural exchange and the intense blending of various ethnic and religious groups – and yet this is nearly impossible .
at the intersection between cultures , video screens point out that today ’ s trade with the orient rests largely on oil and drugs and that the ancient pilgrimage routes are today ’ s border crossings for refugees and illegal aliens .
over-sized paintings recall the decades of conflict in the middle east while photo montages and installations offer a running commentary on the collision of the religions and the failure to find a lasting peace .
as the exhibit itself proclaims , the combination of historical and contemporary objects intends to provoke the visitor to ask questions about his or her own cultural background and to think about ways to recreate , or better yet emulate , isaac ’ s cultural mission of observing , appreciating and respecting the other .
unfortunately , the visitor leaves wanting to have other more mundane questions addressed like how the elephant survived the northern climate , what political connection charlemagne had with harun al rashid and why isaac ’ s journey never warranted more than a footnote in history books .
but then again maybe these rather pointed historical questions can serve as the departure point for further investigations into inter-cultural history , because such travels certainly weren ’ t limited to charlemagne ’ s period .
and in the end it might just be the curious pursuers of historical facts who , in the exhibit ’ s frequently quoted words of aristotle , wonder and marvel and thereby create the basis for all quests of knowledge and understanding .

after several months in baghdad , the men embarked on their return journey , laden with gifts , the most impressive of which was a white indian elephant , abu abbas – a symbol of friendship from the muslim caliph to the christian king .
but because the pachyderm was so much slower than a horse , the return voyage turned into an arduous four-year adventure along the southern mediterranean from jerusalem to carthage , where isaac – who was now traveling alone – and abu abbas set sail to italy .
in the spring of 802 , isaac crossed the alps on elephant-back and rode on to aachen in the kingdom of the francs .
today , the story sounds like something straight out of " 1001 arabian nights " and indeed the historical circumstances of the journey are somewhat clouded in legend .
charlemagne ’ s own court chronicler einhart is unusually vague about the envoys ’ journey .
only the return of isaac and the white elephant and their festive reception in aachen ’ s coronation hall on july 20 , 802 , were dutifully recorded in the annals of history .
the rest is left largely up to speculation .
whether or not the men actually stayed at harun al rashid ’ s palace in baghdad , what observations they made and which route they took on their round-trip voyage is still a point of discussion for historians .
near certain , however , is that the entire journey took five years and connected two worlds , the orient and the occident .
follow the elephant it is this centuries-old bridge between the cultures , the link between different religions that serves as the thematic compass for the current exhibit in aachen " ex oriente : isaac and the white elephant . "
the historical journey from baghdad to aachen via jerusalem winds its way like a red carpet through the exhibit space , guiding visitors through geographically separate locations in aachen , each intended to " recreate " one of the three cities .
ex oriente ’ s overriding themes of inter-cultural dialogue , reciprocal influences and demarcations are superimposed on the rather sketchy historical timeline sprinkled with artifacts garnered from various periods and places along the white elephant ’ s route .
from medieval maps , books and religious manuscripts to tapestry , pottery and jewelry , the exhibit seeks to conjure up the era of charlemagne and the spirit of the journey while juxtaposing it with the tensions of the present day through contemporary art work interspersed throughout the display area .
thus , the visitor is led on a journey through time and space but is at every step of the way conscious of present day limitations , boundaries , and conflicts .
in fact , the visitor is never able to escape these modern road signs , despite the exhibit ’ s attempts to encourage otherwise .
at numerous points on the journey , the visitor is encouraged to " experience the feeling " of baghdad , jerusalem and aachen around 800 , to relive the cultural exchange and the intense blending of various ethnic and religious groups – and yet this is nearly impossible .
at the intersection between cultures , video screens point out that today ’ s trade with the orient rests largely on oil and drugs and that the ancient pilgrimage routes are today ’ s border crossings for refugees and illegal aliens .
over-sized paintings recall the decades of conflict in the middle east while photo montages and installations offer a running commentary on the collision of the religions and the failure to find a lasting peace .
as the exhibit itself proclaims , the combination of historical and contemporary objects intends to provoke the visitor to ask questions about his or her own cultural background and to think about ways to recreate , or better yet emulate , isaac ’ s cultural mission of observing , appreciating and respecting the other .
unfortunately , the visitor leaves wanting to have other more mundane questions addressed like how the elephant survived the northern climate , what political connection charlemagne had with harun al rashid and why isaac ’ s journey never warranted more than a footnote in history books .
but then again maybe these rather pointed historical questions can serve as the departure point for further investigations into inter-cultural history , because such travels certainly weren ’ t limited to charlemagne ’ s period .
and in the end it might just be the curious pursuers of historical facts who , in the exhibit ’ s frequently quoted words of aristotle , wonder and marvel and thereby create the basis for all quests of knowledge and understanding .
in the case of " ex oriente , " it is the visitor who leaves the exhibit enchanted with the concept of documenting a 1,200 year old journey and questions its relevance to today 's realities .

the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .
his departure marks a defeat for modernists at europe 's largest industrial union . klaus zwickel , 64 , has never been secretive about his differences with deputy chairman jürgen peters .
but since an abortive strike last month in eastern germany over working hours , zwickel had gone on the offensive , blaming peters ' old-school tactics for pitting the public against the union and handing ig metall its worst defeat since 1954 . what followed was a public mud-slinging match that had each side accusing the other of mean-spiritedness and ad hominem attacks .
zwickel repeatedly urged peters to resign .
peters held his ground and went on the counteroffensive . on monday morning , zwickel conceded defeat .
at a press conference in frankfurt , he said he was stepping down immediately , before his planned retirement in october .
but he refused to completely shoulder the blame for the failed labor action in june and fired a final shot at his designated successor . " with this step , i do n't take sole responsibility , " said zwickel .
" the main responsibility for the failed strike is with the deputy chairman and the regional leader for berlin , brandenburg and saxony . " he added : " at no point have they shown a willingness to accept personal consequences for the situation . " two at the top despite his best efforts , zwickel had failed in securing support for another leadership constellation and announced that a " tandem solution " will likely be put in place : peters will lead the union along with berthold huber , a regional leader from the federal state of baden-württemberg -lrb- photo , huber left -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ig metall board had tapped the two men for the post-zwickel leadership positions in april , but the subsequent internal strife led huber to withdraw his candidacy .
he agreed to stand for the deputy post again just last week .
zwickel said he could not support such a solution . " today i can definitely say that there will not be a new beginning at ig metall , " said zwickel .
" something i think is urgently needed . " the appointments are expected to be ratified at a special union congress in august . zwickel 's resignation marks the end of his ten-year career at the ig metall helm and of a three-week leadership struggle that came close to tearing the 2.6-million strong metal workers union apart .
it also marked a fight for the future direction of the union .
zwickel , who had planned to step down in october , had hoped to put a reformer in the top spot that could turn the tide at ig metall , which has seen membership decline sharply in the last decade and its influence wane as demands have grown for more flexible wage bargaining . traditionalist jürgen peters is leading figure in the traditionalist camp of the divided union who still supports the ideology of the exploitation of the working class , according to analysts .
he has fiercely opposed any reforms which might been seen as weakening german unions ' traditional strength and collective-bargaining power .
he has been a vocal opponent of chancellor gerhard schröder 's structural reform package that would ease some workers protections and cut welfare for the long-term employed . since joining the union in 1961 , peters has worked his way toward the top .
until the recent strike fiasco , the 59 year old had received high marks for his instincts , tactical skill and ability to play the game of power politics .
even though zwickel opposed his candidacy as chairman back in april , peters was able to mobilize forces among the rank and file and prevail against his own boss . but the failed action in eastern germany for a 35-hour week looked like it could mark the end of his sparkling career .
even those in his own camp criticized him sharply for dragging out a strike that proved highly unpopular with businesses , the government and even the public .
zwickel had accused peters , who is in charge of collective bargaining , of misleading his colleagues about the effects of the strike , which led to shutdowns of auto plants in western germany .
numerous influential union members besides zwickel pushed for him to resign from his deputy position and withdraw his candidacy for the leadership post . peters ignored such entreaties and sat the leadership storm out , working in the background to gather his forces around him .
it was a strategy that worked in the end . long-term effects it is not clear , however , what peters ' victory will mean for the germany 's second-largest union in the long run .
the ascent of a traditionalist could have a negative effect on the german union movement as a whole , say labor analysts . the traditional industry-wide collective-bargaining agreements that german unions have spearheaded for decades are coming under fire as being too inflexible for today 's economy .
some companies are choosing to opt out of collective bargaining agreements , preferring to bypass union leaders and negotiate with workers directly . unions are also suffering from massive membership losses and are increasingly losing their standing among the public , who perceive them as stubbornly blocking structural reform that might pull germany out of its three years of economic stagnation .

after losing its first strike since wwii and plunging into a leadership row , germany 's most-influential union seems to be losing footing .

enlarge image and the people who are buying the furs are foreigners who are in afghanistan to help rebuild the country .
a number of shops have sprung up in the capital , kabul , selling the skins of wild animals , such as wolves and lynxes .
there are concerns that this trade may eventually lead to the extinction of afghanistan 's snow leopards , which are already an endangered species .
' sold out ' one street in central kabul has 10 or so shops which sell nothing but furs .
they stock a huge range of animal skins .
i went inside one to find out exactly what they were selling and to whom .
there has been a 60 % increase in our business - most of our customers are isaf people kabul fur seller the shopkeeper told me a fox fur coat costs $ 150 .
when i asked him if he had any coats made of snow leopard skin , he said no .
but the reason was far from reassuring - he had sold out .
" they have become so expensive for us - $ 500 .
too expensive for afghans but foreigners can buy them , " he said .
i went into another shop , where there were snow leopard skins .
the owner assured me they were all 10-15 years old but he also revealed that snow leopards and other wild animals have good reason to regret the fall of the taleban .
" there has been a 60 % increase in our business because under the taleban there would n't be any customers .
it 's the market created by the foreigners - particularly those who are working with the un or other ngos environment minister yousef nouristani " the shops were closed - people would not buy .
but now it 's much better .
most of our customers are isaf people . "
isaf are the international troops who are helping to keep the peace in kabul .
new law but why are these shops being allowed to openly sell the skins of endangered species of animal ?
the afghan government says it is trying to put a law together to outlaw such activity .
the snow leopard scientific name : uncia uncia can live 20 years or more listed as endangered by the iucn read more about snow leopards on bbci nature " we hope that we 'll be able to finalise this law within two months , " environment minister yousef nouristani told the bbc .
with so many pressing problems to be tackled in rebuilding afghanistan , he says the government is trying to stop the trade in wild animal fur , but needs the help of those who are coming into the country .
" we have asked most of the foreigners not to buy these things and if there is not a market from the foreigners the afghan people probably do n't need it , " he says .
" it 's the market created by the foreigners - particularly those who are working with the un or other ngos . "
tourist role back at the fur shops , i did n't see any customers go in , western or afghan , but i asked a few people out on the street whether they would consider buying a fur here in kabul .
they 're facing poverty and starvation in the wakhan ali azimi environmentalist one foreigner said he got his own furs hunting in sweden .
" i do n't buy it from here .
besides i do n't know what kind it is and the quality .
many of the animals i have seen here are animals that are endangered like the spotted ones .
i would never buy one of those . "
another drew a distinction between endangered species and animals like rabbits .
" if it 's rabbit fur , and the family has sold the rabbit and the meat and the fur , and they can make an extra $ 10 out of it - then they 're not wasting the animal .
" they 're not just killing it for its fur .
then it does n't seem quite so obscene . "
a third foreigner said : " it seems a bit of a shame just to kill the animals just for the sake of selling them to some tourists here on a street here in kabul . "
' desperate ' situation but animals like the snow leopard are not just being killed for their skins .
snow leopards are most commonly found in north-eastern afghanistan in an area known as the wakhan .
i spoke to ali azimi , the author of a report on afghanistan 's environmental problems , who has just returned from a 10-day trip to the area .
" i was struck by the abject poverty of the people , " he said .
" most can barely afford to have one meal a day .
" and the meal usually consists of a type of grass that grows in the wakhan six months of the year .
six months it is snowbound .
" what they eat is what has been collected over the summer months - and it is a desperate situation for them .
so they 're facing poverty and starvation in the wakhan . "
this poverty and starvation is forcing people to hunt animals that would normally be the prey of the snow leopards - and the thousands of dollars that some people are prepared to pay for their skins is encouraging poachers to hunt these rare and beautiful creatures .
it 's estimated there are now fewer than 100 snow leopards left in afghanistan .
unless urgent measures are taken soon they could disappear from afghanistan altogether .

enlarge image and the people who are buying the furs are foreigners who are in afghanistan to help rebuild the country .
a number of shops have sprung up in the capital , kabul , selling the skins of wild animals , such as wolves and lynxes .
there are concerns that this trade may eventually lead to the extinction of afghanistan 's snow leopards , which are already an endangered species .
' sold out ' one street in central kabul has 10 or so shops which sell nothing but furs .
they stock a huge range of animal skins .
i went inside one to find out exactly what they were selling and to whom .
there has been a 60 % increase in our business - most of our customers are isaf people kabul fur seller the shopkeeper told me a fox fur coat costs $ 150 .
when i asked him if he had any coats made of snow leopard skin , he said no .
but the reason was far from reassuring - he had sold out .
" they have become so expensive for us - $ 500 .
too expensive for afghans but foreigners can buy them , " he said .
i went into another shop , where there were snow leopard skins .
the owner assured me they were all 10-15 years old but he also revealed that snow leopards and other wild animals have good reason to regret the fall of the taleban .
" there has been a 60 % increase in our business because under the taleban there would n't be any customers .
it 's the market created by the foreigners - particularly those who are working with the un or other ngos environment minister yousef nouristani " the shops were closed - people would not buy .
but now it 's much better .
most of our customers are isaf people . "
isaf are the international troops who are helping to keep the peace in kabul .
new law but why are these shops being allowed to openly sell the skins of endangered species of animal ?
the afghan government says it is trying to put a law together to outlaw such activity .
the snow leopard scientific name : uncia uncia can live 20 years or more listed as endangered by the iucn read more about snow leopards on bbci nature " we hope that we 'll be able to finalise this law within two months , " environment minister yousef nouristani told the bbc .
with so many pressing problems to be tackled in rebuilding afghanistan , he says the government is trying to stop the trade in wild animal fur , but needs the help of those who are coming into the country .
" we have asked most of the foreigners not to buy these things and if there is not a market from the foreigners the afghan people probably do n't need it , " he says .
" it 's the market created by the foreigners - particularly those who are working with the un or other ngos . "
tourist role back at the fur shops , i did n't see any customers go in , western or afghan , but i asked a few people out on the street whether they would consider buying a fur here in kabul .
they 're facing poverty and starvation in the wakhan ali azimi environmentalist one foreigner said he got his own furs hunting in sweden .
" i do n't buy it from here .
besides i do n't know what kind it is and the quality .
many of the animals i have seen here are animals that are endangered like the spotted ones .
i would never buy one of those . "
another drew a distinction between endangered species and animals like rabbits .
" if it 's rabbit fur , and the family has sold the rabbit and the meat and the fur , and they can make an extra $ 10 out of it - then they 're not wasting the animal .
" they 're not just killing it for its fur .
then it does n't seem quite so obscene . "
a third foreigner said : " it seems a bit of a shame just to kill the animals just for the sake of selling them to some tourists here on a street here in kabul . "
' desperate ' situation but animals like the snow leopard are not just being killed for their skins .
snow leopards are most commonly found in north-eastern afghanistan in an area known as the wakhan .
i spoke to ali azimi , the author of a report on afghanistan 's environmental problems , who has just returned from a 10-day trip to the area .
" i was struck by the abject poverty of the people , " he said .
" most can barely afford to have one meal a day .
" and the meal usually consists of a type of grass that grows in the wakhan six months of the year .
six months it is snowbound .
" what they eat is what has been collected over the summer months - and it is a desperate situation for them .
so they 're facing poverty and starvation in the wakhan . "
this poverty and starvation is forcing people to hunt animals that would normally be the prey of the snow leopards - and the thousands of dollars that some people are prepared to pay for their skins is encouraging poachers to hunt these rare and beautiful creatures .
it 's estimated there are now fewer than 100 snow leopards left in afghanistan .
unless urgent measures are taken soon they could disappear from afghanistan altogether .

the annual event , which runs for four days , is expected to attract 200,000 visitors to the showground at llanelwedd , builth wells .
up to 7,000 livestock entries will compete for prizes at the show , and more than 1,000 trade stands will offer a range of goods , including welsh food produce , handicrafts , jewellery and antiques .
in 2001 , the show had to be cancelled because of the foot-and-mouth crisis , and organisers suffered losses of £ 500,000 .
but the show recovered in 2002 to record a profit of £ 250,000 .
the show , which was officially opened at 1030 bst in the bandstand , has controversially banned dogs on the showground this year .
organisers said the dog ban - with the exception of guide dogs - was made on health and safety grounds as unleashed pets had caused " chaos " in animal sheds in the past .
several politicians are due at the show , including first minister rhodri morgan and welsh secretary peter hain .
mr hain will visit on monday , and is scheduled to meet representatives from the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- and the farmers ' union of wales -lrb- fuw -rrb- .
franz fischler , the european union commissioner for agriculture , will attend the show on thursday , and will be questioned by young farmers .
during the show , the welsh conservatives have started a petition against the hunting bill , arguing a ban on hunting would have an adverse effect on rural wales .
as part of the show programme itself , people from around wales will be giving a demonstration of hunting techniques every afternoon in the main circle .
arts plans plans for a new arts and education centre at the showground are also on display all week .
it is hoped they will be built to mark the show 's centenary in 2004 .
the buildings are designed to become a focal point for arts , culture and youth activities in mid wales and will include conference , seminar and meeting facilities .
they will also house new offices for the society and provide improved facilities for members , judges and stewards .
major show awards , including the royal welsh scholarships and student of the year awards , will be presented on monday afternoon .
in an attempt to ease traffic build-up , wales & borders trains is putting on a special service calling at stations across south wales , including cardiff central , bridgend and ammanford .

for the second weekend in a row , redcar 's lifeboats were called out twice after reports that inflatable toys and dinghies had drifted out to sea .
in the first incident coastwatch redcar saw a floating item two miles out to sea off redcar .
because of the distance from the shore it was not clear if anyone was on board , so both redcar lifeboats were launched .
the dolphin-shaped inflatable was found and crews carried out a search of the area , but no-one was found so it is assumed the toy was abandoned .
on the way to this incident the crew found another empty inflatable toy , and a teenager floating on a dinghy .
he had drifted out to sea after trying to retrieve a football .

for the second weekend in a row , redcar 's lifeboats were called out twice after reports that inflatable toys and dinghies had drifted out to sea .
in the first incident coastwatch redcar saw a floating item two miles out to sea off redcar .
because of the distance from the shore it was not clear if anyone was on board , so both redcar lifeboats were launched .
the dolphin-shaped inflatable was found and crews carried out a search of the area , but no-one was found so it is assumed the toy was abandoned .
on the way to this incident the crew found another empty inflatable toy , and a teenager floating on a dinghy .
he had drifted out to sea after trying to retrieve a football .
on hour later the redcar lifeboat had to be lauched after another inflatable drifted off the coast .
lifeboat crews are warning people that inflatable toys should only be used in swimming pools , where children can be supervised .

mr martin was interviewed by police after being reported by jon lister , who had taken pictures of him surfing at seven mile beach in byron bay , 500 miles north of sydney .
the incident occurred hours before coldplay were due to headline sydney 's splendour in the grass festival .
mr martin has been issued with a notice to appear at the byron bay local court on 8 october - although police said there were procedures which would allow him to be legally represented in his absence .
inspector greg carey said it was alleged mr martin , 26 , approached mr lister after he had been surfing .
" a short time later , the journalist has returned to the motor vehicle where he has seen the person smashing his windscreen and letting the air out of his tyres , " he said .
' temper ' " that journalist attended the byron bay police station where he reported the matter .
" police interviewed the gentleman where he admitted he had lost his temper due to the constant harassment by that journalist , and consequently smashed his windscreen and let the air out of his tyres . "
mr martin went on to play an hour-long set with coldplay at the festival , but made no reference to the incident .
his record company in australia , emi , had no comment to make .
since coldplay rose to fame in 2000 with their album parachutes , chris martin has struggled to keep his private life out of the public spotlight - especially after his relationship with hollywood actress gwyneth paltrow began .
coldplay are appearing on monday at sydney 's horden pavillion , for the first of two shows , before heading to auckland , and rounding off their world tour at the fuji rock festival in japan .

jersey fishermen say they are finding their vessels are not able to secure the licences they need to fish in the bailiwick .
the new system , in which vessels will have to meet strict criteria , such as length , engine size and ownership before they receive a licence to operate in guernsey waters , is due to be introduced in october .
deputy lyndon trott , vice president of the guernsey sea fisheries committee , said no jersey fishermen had yet been refused licences to fish in guernsey waters .
fish conservation from october , anyone fishing from an unlicensed vessel in guernsey waters may be fined up to £ 50,000 .
guernsey 's sea fisheries said : " it is a conservation tool that is used throughout the world .
" the overall aim of fishing vessel licensing is to protect the stock and maintain it at a sustainable level for future generations . "
members of the jersey fishermen 's association said they were particularly concerned that they were not consulted before the new regulations were decided .
guernsey 's sea fisheries department says jersey fishing vessels will still be able to fish if they can prove they used the waters previously .
