this week , u.s. actor dustin hoffmann surprisingly took the floor in berlin , calling for peace at berlin 's unicef gala " cinema for peace " - a motto that in the current world situation , could not be more appropriate .
addressing more than 500 prominent guests at the berlin concert hall , hoffman spoke out against washington 's policy on iraq and warned that a conflict in the region could turn into another vietnam .
hoffmann said he was not anti-american but was against the policies of the current u.s. government .
he compared the current conflict with the buildup in the 1960s which led to the vietnam war - a war , he said which " began with a lie . "
the actor warned that those times could repeat themselves and ended his address by reading a poem by american author carl sandburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2003 columbia disaster threatens space station großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rose for the lost with nasa 's space shuttle program out of commission for now , european and russian partners in the international space station face difficult questions about the project 's future . as nasa officials in the united states sought answers to saturday 's space shuttle columbia catastrophe , which killed seven astronauts , european space authorities began considering the ramifications the deadly accident could have on the international space station .
" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international space station still , it is too early to consider the longterm consequences , bonacino cautioned .
" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .
we will continue to train our astronauts and , for the time being , there will be no changes , but this is an evolving situation . "
for now at least , the € 100 billion -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- iss program is " not in danger , " he said .
esa 's director for manned space flights , jörg feustel-buechl , told german public television the columbia disaster would n't impact european participation in the space station program , as long as shuttle flights are n't suspended for " too long . "
temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .

addressing more than 500 prominent guests at the berlin concert hall , hoffman spoke out against washington 's policy on iraq and warned that a conflict in the region could turn into another vietnam .
hoffmann said he was not anti-american but was against the policies of the current u.s. government .
he compared the current conflict with the buildup in the 1960s which led to the vietnam war - a war , he said which " began with a lie . "
the actor warned that those times could repeat themselves and ended his address by reading a poem by american author carl sandburg .
" he said exactly what we were all thinking , " german actress hannelore elsner said after the speech , while german action film star ralf moeller admitted hoffman 's speech had brought tears to his eyes .

this week , u.s. actor dustin hoffmann surprisingly took the floor in berlin , calling for peace at berlin 's unicef gala " cinema for peace " - a motto that in the current world situation , could not be more appropriate .
addressing more than 500 prominent guests at the berlin concert hall , hoffman spoke out against washington 's policy on iraq and warned that a conflict in the region could turn into another vietnam .
hoffmann said he was not anti-american but was against the policies of the current u.s. government .
he compared the current conflict with the buildup in the 1960s which led to the vietnam war - a war , he said which " began with a lie . "
the actor warned that those times could repeat themselves and ended his address by reading a poem by american author carl sandburg .
" he said exactly what we were all thinking , " german actress hannelore elsner said after the speech , while german action film star ralf moeller admitted hoffman 's speech had brought tears to his eyes .
outside , numerous other international stars gathered for the lighting of the eternal flame for world peace at berlin 's historic " gendarmenmarkt " .
the group included former james bond actor roger moore , faye dunaway , christopher lee and george clooney , who compared george w. bush 's policy to mafia methods shown in the television series " the sopranos " .
only a week earlier , at the same place , musician elton john had spoken out against war at the golden camera awards in berlin , expressing praise for germany 's stance in the iraq conflict with a " well done , germany ! " " i 'm very proud that germany has said no to war , " he said .

" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "

" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .
we will continue to train our astronauts and , for the time being , there will be no changes , but this is an evolving situation . "
for now at least , the € 100 billion -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- iss program is " not in danger , " he said .
esa 's director for manned space flights , jörg feustel-buechl , told german public television the columbia disaster would n't impact european participation in the space station program , as long as shuttle flights are n't suspended for " too long . "
temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .
there are currently three european astronauts scheduled for flights to the space station - two on russian soyuz rockets and one who is scheduled to depart on the space shuttle atlantis in july 2003 .
however , all three flights have been placed under review until the safety of the u.s. and russian space programs can be determined in the wake of the second deadly disaster in the space shuttle program 's two decade history .

but a planned soyuz journey in april would extend that timeframe .
however , with a capacity of only 5 tons -lrb- compared to a shuttle 's 100 tons -rrb- , the soyuz rockets lack the massive cargo bays of the space shuttle and are unable to carry the large components needed to continue building the space station .
russia is also only capable of building two of the single-use soyuz craft a year , making it difficult to maintain supplies let alone shuttle astronauts to the orbiting laboratory .
longterm suspension of flights on the remaining three space shuttles could have major financial implications not only for the united states , but also for other countries participating in the iss project - including canada , russia , japan and europe .
" a delay of the expansion of the station will cost , " german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- space travel project leader klaus berge told the news agency dpa .
" if plans are delayed by a year , that would cost germany alone € 250 million , " he said .
but esa 's feustel-buechl downplayed such estimates as " speculation . "
russian space program to lead for now with increased demand for its soyuz spacecraft , russia says it plans to discontinue its space tourism program .
the move comes as russia 's role in maintaining iss is expected to increase .
until nasa is able to find answers , russia will be responsible for servicing the space station .
on sunday , moscow went ahead with the launch of a progress 47 unmanned supply vehicle carrying groceries , fuel and technical equipment for the iss crew .
currently , there are two american astronauts and one russian living on the space station .
it 's still unclear how long the men will have to stay in orbit .
" there 's never been a situation like this , " russian space program director valeri rjoemin said .

russian experts interviewed by dw-radio said they believe there 's a good chance the space station will have to be temporarily abandoned because russian supply vehicles ca n't replace the grounded fleet of space shuttles - at least not in the long run .

temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .
there are currently three european astronauts scheduled for flights to the space station - two on russian soyuz rockets and one who is scheduled to depart on the space shuttle atlantis in july 2003 .
however , all three flights have been placed under review until the safety of the u.s. and russian space programs can be determined in the wake of the second deadly disaster in the space shuttle program 's two decade history .

but a planned soyuz journey in april would extend that timeframe .
however , with a capacity of only 5 tons -lrb- compared to a shuttle 's 100 tons -rrb- , the soyuz rockets lack the massive cargo bays of the space shuttle and are unable to carry the large components needed to continue building the space station .
russia is also only capable of building two of the single-use soyuz craft a year , making it difficult to maintain supplies let alone shuttle astronauts to the orbiting laboratory .
longterm suspension of flights on the remaining three space shuttles could have major financial implications not only for the united states , but also for other countries participating in the iss project - including canada , russia , japan and europe .
" a delay of the expansion of the station will cost , " german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- space travel project leader klaus berge told the news agency dpa .
" if plans are delayed by a year , that would cost germany alone € 250 million , " he said .

the move comes as russia 's role in maintaining iss is expected to increase .

on sunday , moscow went ahead with the launch of a progress 47 unmanned supply vehicle carrying groceries , fuel and technical equipment for the iss crew .
currently , there are two american astronauts and one russian living on the space station .
it 's still unclear how long the men will have to stay in orbit .

russian experts interviewed by dw-radio said they believe there 's a good chance the space station will have to be temporarily abandoned because russian supply vehicles ca n't replace the grounded fleet of space shuttles - at least not in the long run .

" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "

" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .

" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international space station still , it is too early to consider the longterm consequences , bonacino cautioned .
" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .
we will continue to train our astronauts and , for the time being , there will be no changes , but this is an evolving situation . "
for now at least , the € 100 billion -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- iss program is " not in danger , " he said .
esa 's director for manned space flights , jörg feustel-buechl , told german public television the columbia disaster would n't impact european participation in the space station program , as long as shuttle flights are n't suspended for " too long . "
temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .
there are currently three european astronauts scheduled for flights to the space station - two on russian soyuz rockets and one who is scheduled to depart on the space shuttle atlantis in july 2003 .
however , all three flights have been placed under review until the safety of the u.s. and russian space programs can be determined in the wake of the second deadly disaster in the space shuttle program 's two decade history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soyuz tm booster rocket supplies on the iss are sufficient for astronauts to remain on board at least until june .
but a planned soyuz journey in april would extend that timeframe .
however , with a capacity of only 5 tons -lrb- compared to a shuttle 's 100 tons -rrb- , the soyuz rockets lack the massive cargo bays of the space shuttle and are unable to carry the large components needed to continue building the space station .
russia is also only capable of building two of the single-use soyuz craft a year , making it difficult to maintain supplies let alone shuttle astronauts to the orbiting laboratory .
longterm suspension of flights on the remaining three space shuttles could have major financial implications not only for the united states , but also for other countries participating in the iss project - including canada , russia , japan and europe .
" a delay of the expansion of the station will cost , " german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- space travel project leader klaus berge told the news agency dpa .
" if plans are delayed by a year , that would cost germany alone € 250 million , " he said .
but esa 's feustel-buechl downplayed such estimates as " speculation . "
russian space program to lead for now with increased demand for its soyuz spacecraft , russia says it plans to discontinue its space tourism program .
the move comes as russia 's role in maintaining iss is expected to increase .
until nasa is able to find answers , russia will be responsible for servicing the space station .
on sunday , moscow went ahead with the launch of a progress 47 unmanned supply vehicle carrying groceries , fuel and technical equipment for the iss crew .
currently , there are two american astronauts and one russian living on the space station .
it 's still unclear how long the men will have to stay in orbit .
" there 's never been a situation like this , " russian space program director valeri rjoemin said .
" we 're going to have to reconsider the entire program of cooperation on the international space station .
at this time , we can continue to supply the station with our supply vehicles and also ferry astronauts , but not forever .
we need more money for these types of transports . "
russian experts interviewed by dw-radio said they believe there 's a good chance the space station will have to be temporarily abandoned because russian supply vehicles ca n't replace the grounded fleet of space shuttles - at least not in the long run .
but the russian aviation and space agency -lrb- rosaviakosmos -rrb- says the iss can still be manned for at least another year .
but a spokesman said the agency could not rule out the possibilities of delays in future launches and that the possibility of maintaining the station , at least for a time , without astronauts , would also be reviewed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. space shuttle columbia crashes , killing crew the u.s. space program suffered one of the worst accidents in its history , when the columbia broke apart shortly before it was meant to land .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2003 columbia disaster threatens space station großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rose for the lost with nasa 's space shuttle program out of commission for now , european and russian partners in the international space station face difficult questions about the project 's future . as nasa officials in the united states sought answers to saturday 's space shuttle columbia catastrophe , which killed seven astronauts , european space authorities began considering the ramifications the deadly accident could have on the international space station .
" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international space station still , it is too early to consider the longterm consequences , bonacino cautioned .
" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .
we will continue to train our astronauts and , for the time being , there will be no changes , but this is an evolving situation . "
for now at least , the € 100 billion -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- iss program is " not in danger , " he said .
esa 's director for manned space flights , jörg feustel-buechl , told german public television the columbia disaster would n't impact european participation in the space station program , as long as shuttle flights are n't suspended for " too long . "
temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .
there are currently three european astronauts scheduled for flights to the space station - two on russian soyuz rockets and one who is scheduled to depart on the space shuttle atlantis in july 2003 .
however , all three flights have been placed under review until the safety of the u.s. and russian space programs can be determined in the wake of the second deadly disaster in the space shuttle program 's two decade history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soyuz tm booster rocket supplies on the iss are sufficient for astronauts to remain on board at least until june .
but a planned soyuz journey in april would extend that timeframe .
however , with a capacity of only 5 tons -lrb- compared to a shuttle 's 100 tons -rrb- , the soyuz rockets lack the massive cargo bays of the space shuttle and are unable to carry the large components needed to continue building the space station .
russia is also only capable of building two of the single-use soyuz craft a year , making it difficult to maintain supplies let alone shuttle astronauts to the orbiting laboratory .
longterm suspension of flights on the remaining three space shuttles could have major financial implications not only for the united states , but also for other countries participating in the iss project - including canada , russia , japan and europe .
" a delay of the expansion of the station will cost , " german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- space travel project leader klaus berge told the news agency dpa .
" if plans are delayed by a year , that would cost germany alone € 250 million , " he said .
but esa 's feustel-buechl downplayed such estimates as " speculation . "
russian space program to lead for now with increased demand for its soyuz spacecraft , russia says it plans to discontinue its space tourism program .
the move comes as russia 's role in maintaining iss is expected to increase .
until nasa is able to find answers , russia will be responsible for servicing the space station .
on sunday , moscow went ahead with the launch of a progress 47 unmanned supply vehicle carrying groceries , fuel and technical equipment for the iss crew .
currently , there are two american astronauts and one russian living on the space station .
it 's still unclear how long the men will have to stay in orbit .
" there 's never been a situation like this , " russian space program director valeri rjoemin said .
" we 're going to have to reconsider the entire program of cooperation on the international space station .
at this time , we can continue to supply the station with our supply vehicles and also ferry astronauts , but not forever .
we need more money for these types of transports . "
russian experts interviewed by dw-radio said they believe there 's a good chance the space station will have to be temporarily abandoned because russian supply vehicles ca n't replace the grounded fleet of space shuttles - at least not in the long run .
but the russian aviation and space agency -lrb- rosaviakosmos -rrb- says the iss can still be manned for at least another year .
but a spokesman said the agency could not rule out the possibilities of delays in future launches and that the possibility of maintaining the station , at least for a time , without astronauts , would also be reviewed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. space shuttle columbia crashes , killing crew the u.s. space program suffered one of the worst accidents in its history , when the columbia broke apart shortly before it was meant to land .

" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international space station still , it is too early to consider the longterm consequences , bonacino cautioned .
" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .
we will continue to train our astronauts and , for the time being , there will be no changes , but this is an evolving situation . "
for now at least , the € 100 billion -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- iss program is " not in danger , " he said .
esa 's director for manned space flights , jörg feustel-buechl , told german public television the columbia disaster would n't impact european participation in the space station program , as long as shuttle flights are n't suspended for " too long . "
temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .
there are currently three european astronauts scheduled for flights to the space station - two on russian soyuz rockets and one who is scheduled to depart on the space shuttle atlantis in july 2003 .
however , all three flights have been placed under review until the safety of the u.s. and russian space programs can be determined in the wake of the second deadly disaster in the space shuttle program 's two decade history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soyuz tm booster rocket supplies on the iss are sufficient for astronauts to remain on board at least until june .
but a planned soyuz journey in april would extend that timeframe .
however , with a capacity of only 5 tons -lrb- compared to a shuttle 's 100 tons -rrb- , the soyuz rockets lack the massive cargo bays of the space shuttle and are unable to carry the large components needed to continue building the space station .
russia is also only capable of building two of the single-use soyuz craft a year , making it difficult to maintain supplies let alone shuttle astronauts to the orbiting laboratory .
longterm suspension of flights on the remaining three space shuttles could have major financial implications not only for the united states , but also for other countries participating in the iss project - including canada , russia , japan and europe .
" a delay of the expansion of the station will cost , " german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- space travel project leader klaus berge told the news agency dpa .
" if plans are delayed by a year , that would cost germany alone € 250 million , " he said .
but esa 's feustel-buechl downplayed such estimates as " speculation . "
russian space program to lead for now with increased demand for its soyuz spacecraft , russia says it plans to discontinue its space tourism program .
the move comes as russia 's role in maintaining iss is expected to increase .
until nasa is able to find answers , russia will be responsible for servicing the space station .
on sunday , moscow went ahead with the launch of a progress 47 unmanned supply vehicle carrying groceries , fuel and technical equipment for the iss crew .
currently , there are two american astronauts and one russian living on the space station .
it 's still unclear how long the men will have to stay in orbit .
" there 's never been a situation like this , " russian space program director valeri rjoemin said .
" we 're going to have to reconsider the entire program of cooperation on the international space station .
at this time , we can continue to supply the station with our supply vehicles and also ferry astronauts , but not forever .
we need more money for these types of transports . "
russian experts interviewed by dw-radio said they believe there 's a good chance the space station will have to be temporarily abandoned because russian supply vehicles ca n't replace the grounded fleet of space shuttles - at least not in the long run .
but the russian aviation and space agency -lrb- rosaviakosmos -rrb- says the iss can still be manned for at least another year .

" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international space station still , it is too early to consider the longterm consequences , bonacino cautioned .
" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .
we will continue to train our astronauts and , for the time being , there will be no changes , but this is an evolving situation . "
for now at least , the € 100 billion -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- iss program is " not in danger , " he said .
esa 's director for manned space flights , jörg feustel-buechl , told german public television the columbia disaster would n't impact european participation in the space station program , as long as shuttle flights are n't suspended for " too long . "
temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .
there are currently three european astronauts scheduled for flights to the space station - two on russian soyuz rockets and one who is scheduled to depart on the space shuttle atlantis in july 2003 .
however , all three flights have been placed under review until the safety of the u.s. and russian space programs can be determined in the wake of the second deadly disaster in the space shuttle program 's two decade history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soyuz tm booster rocket supplies on the iss are sufficient for astronauts to remain on board at least until june .
but a planned soyuz journey in april would extend that timeframe .
however , with a capacity of only 5 tons -lrb- compared to a shuttle 's 100 tons -rrb- , the soyuz rockets lack the massive cargo bays of the space shuttle and are unable to carry the large components needed to continue building the space station .
russia is also only capable of building two of the single-use soyuz craft a year , making it difficult to maintain supplies let alone shuttle astronauts to the orbiting laboratory .
longterm suspension of flights on the remaining three space shuttles could have major financial implications not only for the united states , but also for other countries participating in the iss project - including canada , russia , japan and europe .
" a delay of the expansion of the station will cost , " german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- space travel project leader klaus berge told the news agency dpa .
" if plans are delayed by a year , that would cost germany alone € 250 million , " he said .
but esa 's feustel-buechl downplayed such estimates as " speculation . "
russian space program to lead for now with increased demand for its soyuz spacecraft , russia says it plans to discontinue its space tourism program .
the move comes as russia 's role in maintaining iss is expected to increase .
until nasa is able to find answers , russia will be responsible for servicing the space station .
on sunday , moscow went ahead with the launch of a progress 47 unmanned supply vehicle carrying groceries , fuel and technical equipment for the iss crew .
currently , there are two american astronauts and one russian living on the space station .
it 's still unclear how long the men will have to stay in orbit .
" there 's never been a situation like this , " russian space program director valeri rjoemin said .
" we 're going to have to reconsider the entire program of cooperation on the international space station .
at this time , we can continue to supply the station with our supply vehicles and also ferry astronauts , but not forever .
we need more money for these types of transports . "
russian experts interviewed by dw-radio said they believe there 's a good chance the space station will have to be temporarily abandoned because russian supply vehicles ca n't replace the grounded fleet of space shuttles - at least not in the long run .
but the russian aviation and space agency -lrb- rosaviakosmos -rrb- says the iss can still be manned for at least another year .

this week , u.s. actor dustin hoffmann surprisingly took the floor in berlin , calling for peace at berlin 's unicef gala " cinema for peace " - a motto that in the current world situation , could not be more appropriate .
addressing more than 500 prominent guests at the berlin concert hall , hoffman spoke out against washington 's policy on iraq and warned that a conflict in the region could turn into another vietnam .
hoffmann said he was not anti-american but was against the policies of the current u.s. government .
he compared the current conflict with the buildup in the 1960s which led to the vietnam war - a war , he said which " began with a lie . "
the actor warned that those times could repeat themselves and ended his address by reading a poem by american author carl sandburg .
" he said exactly what we were all thinking , " german actress hannelore elsner said after the speech , while german action film star ralf moeller admitted hoffman 's speech had brought tears to his eyes .
outside , numerous other international stars gathered for the lighting of the eternal flame for world peace at berlin 's historic " gendarmenmarkt " .
the group included former james bond actor roger moore , faye dunaway , christopher lee and george clooney , who compared george w. bush 's policy to mafia methods shown in the television series " the sopranos " .

riding the peace train many stars have jumped on to the peace bandwagon ever since the u.s. put military pressure on iraq , expressing their protest in all kinds of ways : in a television interview in the u.s. , viggo mortenson -lrb- " lord of the rings " -rrb- wore a t-shirt saying " no more blood for oil " , while singer sheryl crow stepped to the stage at a recent concert with a shirt emblazoned with the words , " war is not the answer " . actors and actresses susan sarandon , martin sheen and jessica lange have all led peace marches in washington and other cities in the u.s. , while actor sean penn even visited iraq to talk to officials shortly before christmas . in addition , matt damon , helen hunt and kim basinger have all sent protest letters with hundreds of prominent signatures affixed to them directly to the white house . raising awareness " as a father , actor , filmmaker and a patriot , my visit to iraq is for me a natural extension of my obligation to find my own voice on matters of conscience , " penn said upon his arrival in baghdad . penn stands in the tradition of other actors , such as jane fonda , who travelled to and reported from vietnam in the 60s . but can celebrity activism actually lead to political change ?

" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international space station still , it is too early to consider the longterm consequences , bonacino cautioned .
" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .
we will continue to train our astronauts and , for the time being , there will be no changes , but this is an evolving situation . "
for now at least , the € 100 billion -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- iss program is " not in danger , " he said .
esa 's director for manned space flights , jörg feustel-buechl , told german public television the columbia disaster would n't impact european participation in the space station program , as long as shuttle flights are n't suspended for " too long . "
temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .
there are currently three european astronauts scheduled for flights to the space station - two on russian soyuz rockets and one who is scheduled to depart on the space shuttle atlantis in july 2003 .
however , all three flights have been placed under review until the safety of the u.s. and russian space programs can be determined in the wake of the second deadly disaster in the space shuttle program 's two decade history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soyuz tm booster rocket supplies on the iss are sufficient for astronauts to remain on board at least until june .
but a planned soyuz journey in april would extend that timeframe .
however , with a capacity of only 5 tons -lrb- compared to a shuttle 's 100 tons -rrb- , the soyuz rockets lack the massive cargo bays of the space shuttle and are unable to carry the large components needed to continue building the space station .
russia is also only capable of building two of the single-use soyuz craft a year , making it difficult to maintain supplies let alone shuttle astronauts to the orbiting laboratory .
longterm suspension of flights on the remaining three space shuttles could have major financial implications not only for the united states , but also for other countries participating in the iss project - including canada , russia , japan and europe .
" a delay of the expansion of the station will cost , " german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- space travel project leader klaus berge told the news agency dpa .
" if plans are delayed by a year , that would cost germany alone € 250 million , " he said .
but esa 's feustel-buechl downplayed such estimates as " speculation . "
russian space program to lead for now with increased demand for its soyuz spacecraft , russia says it plans to discontinue its space tourism program .
the move comes as russia 's role in maintaining iss is expected to increase .
until nasa is able to find answers , russia will be responsible for servicing the space station .
on sunday , moscow went ahead with the launch of a progress 47 unmanned supply vehicle carrying groceries , fuel and technical equipment for the iss crew .
currently , there are two american astronauts and one russian living on the space station .
it 's still unclear how long the men will have to stay in orbit .
" there 's never been a situation like this , " russian space program director valeri rjoemin said .
" we 're going to have to reconsider the entire program of cooperation on the international space station .
at this time , we can continue to supply the station with our supply vehicles and also ferry astronauts , but not forever .
we need more money for these types of transports . "
russian experts interviewed by dw-radio said they believe there 's a good chance the space station will have to be temporarily abandoned because russian supply vehicles ca n't replace the grounded fleet of space shuttles - at least not in the long run .
but the russian aviation and space agency -lrb- rosaviakosmos -rrb- says the iss can still be manned for at least another year .

" the immediate consequence is that we will have no space shuttle flights for a while - at least for as long as we do n't know what happened , " franco bonacina , spokesman for the paris-based european space agency , told dw-world .
" without shuttle flights , we can not continue to grow the space station as planned , but everything else is under control .
the crew on board can continue to perform their tasks , and supplies can be refurbished through russian soyuz flights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international space station still , it is too early to consider the longterm consequences , bonacino cautioned .
" in the coming months , we will have to reassess the iss -lrb- photo -rrb- program and rearrange the schedule , but no one is putting into question whether or not space travel will continue .
we will continue to train our astronauts and , for the time being , there will be no changes , but this is an evolving situation . "
for now at least , the € 100 billion -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- iss program is " not in danger , " he said .
esa 's director for manned space flights , jörg feustel-buechl , told german public television the columbia disaster would n't impact european participation in the space station program , as long as shuttle flights are n't suspended for " too long . "
temporary abandonment a possibility but most agree that the iss program can not continue without the space shuttle and that if quick answers for the accident are n't found , the international cooperation could be jeopardized .
after the deadly explosion of the space shuttle challenger in 1986 , nasa suspended shuttle flights for nearly three years .
if this grounding of the fleet lasts as long , the iss will have to be abandoned .
there are currently three european astronauts scheduled for flights to the space station - two on russian soyuz rockets and one who is scheduled to depart on the space shuttle atlantis in july 2003 .
however , all three flights have been placed under review until the safety of the u.s. and russian space programs can be determined in the wake of the second deadly disaster in the space shuttle program 's two decade history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soyuz tm booster rocket supplies on the iss are sufficient for astronauts to remain on board at least until june .
but a planned soyuz journey in april would extend that timeframe .
however , with a capacity of only 5 tons -lrb- compared to a shuttle 's 100 tons -rrb- , the soyuz rockets lack the massive cargo bays of the space shuttle and are unable to carry the large components needed to continue building the space station .
russia is also only capable of building two of the single-use soyuz craft a year , making it difficult to maintain supplies let alone shuttle astronauts to the orbiting laboratory .
longterm suspension of flights on the remaining three space shuttles could have major financial implications not only for the united states , but also for other countries participating in the iss project - including canada , russia , japan and europe .
" a delay of the expansion of the station will cost , " german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- space travel project leader klaus berge told the news agency dpa .
" if plans are delayed by a year , that would cost germany alone € 250 million , " he said .
but esa 's feustel-buechl downplayed such estimates as " speculation . "
russian space program to lead for now with increased demand for its soyuz spacecraft , russia says it plans to discontinue its space tourism program .
the move comes as russia 's role in maintaining iss is expected to increase .
until nasa is able to find answers , russia will be responsible for servicing the space station .
on sunday , moscow went ahead with the launch of a progress 47 unmanned supply vehicle carrying groceries , fuel and technical equipment for the iss crew .
currently , there are two american astronauts and one russian living on the space station .
it 's still unclear how long the men will have to stay in orbit .
" there 's never been a situation like this , " russian space program director valeri rjoemin said .
" we 're going to have to reconsider the entire program of cooperation on the international space station .
at this time , we can continue to supply the station with our supply vehicles and also ferry astronauts , but not forever .
we need more money for these types of transports . "
russian experts interviewed by dw-radio said they believe there 's a good chance the space station will have to be temporarily abandoned because russian supply vehicles ca n't replace the grounded fleet of space shuttles - at least not in the long run .
but the russian aviation and space agency -lrb- rosaviakosmos -rrb- says the iss can still be manned for at least another year .
but a spokesman said the agency could not rule out the possibilities of delays in future launches and that the possibility of maintaining the station , at least for a time , without astronauts , would also be reviewed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. space shuttle columbia crashes , killing crew the u.s. space program suffered one of the worst accidents in its history , when the columbia broke apart shortly before it was meant to land .

and efforts to tackle the problem may be hampered because fewer cases are being investigated , the nao warns .
fraud and error in jobseekers ' allowance and income support fell by a quarter between 1997/8 and 2002 , according to the report .
but it also notes that the number of cases investigated dropped by 12 % between 2001 and 2002 .
the department of work and pensions says it is beginning to win the battle against fraud , but an mps ' spending watchdog fears it may be " losing ground " .
the department does not have up-to-date measurements of the amount of fraud edward leigh commons public accounts committee the nao report suggests the number of cases investigated has partly fallen because regional benefits offices are only interested in examining cases based on better intelligence .
it says : " the reduction in checks and investigations may jeopardise further progress towards the department 's target to reduce losses from fraud and error . "
high risk areas edward leigh , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , noted that the loss in income support and jobseekers ' allowance had gone down .
" what causes me concern is that in some respects the department may be losing ground , " said conservative mp mr leigh .
" the amount of fraud investigation activity and the value of overall fraud detected are actually going down .
we are by no means complacent department of work and pensions " and the number of higher risk benefit claims subject to extra checks has fallen by no less than a fifth in a year . "
mr leigh argued it was essential to tackle fraud and error in the worst hit areas of benefits - income support and jobseekers ' allowance .
he continued : " that is only part of the picture .
the department does not have up-to-date measurements of the amount of fraud being carried out against a whole range of other benefits .
" some benefits have not been looked at for nearly six years . "
the government aims to cut housing benefit fraud by a quarter by 2006 , but the nao says it will not have an accurate estimate of the amount of fraud until late this year .
key savings criminals use forged birth certificates or passports , as well as dead people 's national insurance numbers , to create false identities .
one suspect was found to have 20 separate identities , for example .
in a statement , the department for work and pensions said : " we are starting to win the war against fraud and error .

and efforts to tackle the problem may be hampered because fewer cases are being investigated , the nao warns .
fraud and error in jobseekers ' allowance and income support fell by a quarter between 1997/8 and 2002 , according to the report .
but it also notes that the number of cases investigated dropped by 12 % between 2001 and 2002 .
the department of work and pensions says it is beginning to win the battle against fraud , but an mps ' spending watchdog fears it may be " losing ground " . "
the department does not have up-to-date measurements of the amount of fraud " edward leigh commons public accounts committee the nao report suggests the number of cases investigated has partly fallen because regional benefits offices are only interested in examining cases based on better intelligence .
it says : " the reduction in checks and investigations may jeopardise further progress towards the department 's target to reduce losses from fraud and error . "
high risk areas edward leigh , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , noted that the loss in income support and jobseekers ' allowance had gone down .
" what causes me concern is that in some respects the department may be losing ground , " said conservative mp mr leigh .
" the amount of fraud investigation activity and the value of overall fraud detected are actually going down . "
we are by no means complacent " department of work and pensions " and the number of higher risk benefit claims subject to extra checks has fallen by no less than a fifth in a year . "
mr leigh argued it was essential to tackle fraud and error in the worst hit areas of benefits - income support and jobseekers ' allowance .
he continued : " that is only part of the picture .
the department does not have up-to-date measurements of the amount of fraud being carried out against a whole range of other benefits .
" some benefits have not been looked at for nearly six years . "
the government aims to cut housing benefit fraud by a quarter by 2006 , but the nao says it will not have an accurate estimate of the amount of fraud until late this year .
key savings criminals use forged birth certificates or passports , as well as dead people 's national insurance numbers , to create false identities .
one suspect was found to have 20 separate identities , for example .
in a statement , the department for work and pensions said : " we are starting to win the war against fraud and error .
this nao report recognises the progress that we have made . "
fraud reductions since 1998 had saved £ 230m - the equivalent of 7,400 new nurses or 7,350 new teachers , it said .
the statement continued : " we are by no means complacent and that 's why we have reorganised the way staff tackle benefit fraud , providing a more professional and intelligence-driven investigation service .

lee , in the german capital to promote his film 25th hour - about new york after the 11 september attacks - praised the french and german governments ' moves to head off conflict .
" the german and french governments should be commended , " he said .
" too many people are being bowled over by bush and tony blair in britain .
it 's ludicrous to expect the whole world to follow what they want . "
he added : " america does n't have the moral right to tell other people what to do .
to say the whole world has to fall into line is you-know-what .
i hope more people will rise up . "
lee 's comments were endorsed by his cast at a press conference , and drew thunderous applause from many of the 300 journalists present .
the film 's lead , edward norton , added : " it 's nice being in europe this week .
almost everyone in germany and france is in sync with the governments .
" i almost forgot what it 's like to be proud of my government . "
" there must be people who remember world war ii and the holocaust that can get us out of this rut " dustin hoffman he said he hoped us citizens would apply pressure on their government to think again .
" it 's dismaying to see the unilateralism the government is doing .
there are n't enough rational steps , " he said .
' unpatriotic ' actress rosario dawson said she was frightened by attitudes in the united states .
" any dissenting opinion is considered unpatriotic , " she said .
" it makes me upset .
i 'm embarrassed .
it 's my hope that americans wo n't jump on anyone having a dissenting opinion . "
lee 's comments , together with those of his stars , add to a growing tide of anti-war sentiment in hollywood .
dustin hoffman repeated his earlier criticisms of mr bush at a black-tie charity dinner on tuesday , while martin scorsese said he hoped war would be averted .
" there must be people who remember world war ii and the holocaust that can get us out of this rut , " he said .
martin sheen , sean penn and robert redford have also attacked a war , while more than a hundred celebrities have signed an open letter urging mr bush to give peace a chance .
25th hour , one of 22 films competing for the festival 's golden bear prize , follows a drug dealer , played by norton , whose life falls apart when he is convicted and sentenced to seven years in jail .
the loss of his lifestyle and the thought his girlfriend may have betrayed him parallels the loss felt by new yorkers throughout the film .
lee hit back at suggestions he was exploiting the sense of loss caused by the attack , in which more than 3,000 people died .
" we wanted to truthfully reflect the rage and the tone of what people felt , " he said .
" i think we were very respectful to the families who lost loved ones .
so long as we are respectful i do n't think we have to bother about such criticism . "

the so-called entitlement cards are expected to contain personal details such as those found on passports and driving licences . "
how do you stop it being a requirement for sensitive data , racial background , religion or political views being held by the state ? "
richard thomas the government has outlined various options for the amount of information to be on the cards and what they would be used for - such as claiming services and benefits .
but the information commissioner , richard thomas , said the proposals were so widely drawn he had " serious concerns " over whether the cards would comply with privacy and data protection laws .
although he realised that individuals sometimes needed a simple way of proving their identity , he identified several problems with the plans as they were .
misuse fears the cards could be a " target " for fraudsters and there would probably be " function creep " , where they would end up being demanded in situations where they were not really needed , he said .
there was a risk of ever-more information being added , and ever-greater state monitoring of individuals ' activities .
a massive central database of information would be needed to run the scheme , and the task of keeping this accurate and up-to-date would be enormous , he said .
" identity cards may be okay , but why do you draw the line ?
how do you stop it being a requirement to hold a card in public ? " said mr thomas .
safeguards needed " how do you stop it being a requirement , for example , of sensitive data ... racial background or religion or political views - all that being held by the state ?
" i do have anxieties about a monolithic state system having so much information on every single citizen in this country , " mr thomas told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
home secretary david blunkett has made it " very clear " that the fight against crime and against terrorism " is not the prime motivator for this scheme " , he said .
mr thomas said : " we want the government to be much more focused about what the purpose is , then we can start talking about what safeguards do we need .
" the police , by and large , say they know who the villains are - identity is not a major problem as far as the police is concerned . "
mr thomas said he knew of no other identity card scheme across the world that was " as ambitious " as the one being proposed in this country . "
he also called for : an independent body to administer the scheme strict limits on the amount of information held on the card effective sanctions against misuse reliable identity validation , possibly with a form of biometric identifier , and strengthened data protection supervision and inspection powers .
he said it could be possible for the government to rewrite its proposals so they met all his objections - " but the task would be a challenging one " .
but labour mp andy burnham said he believed the " simple benefits " of an id card scheme " outweighed some of the negatives " .
" i have come to the conclusion that an identity card would be in the interest of the majority of people who carry their identity anyway , " he told today .
' public trust ' meanwhile , officials in whitehall were reported to be looking for ways to combat public fears of a " big brother " approach by the government in its collection of information on individuals .
according to the guardian , officials on the inter-departmental group looking at data privacy and freedom of information " public trust " was " a particularly difficult issue in this context " .
papers leaked to the paper also reportedly disclosed that downing street had thwarted attempts by 100 tory mps to discover what information it was keeping on them .
the home office said it would study mr thomas 's comments carefully , as well as the views of 2000 other people who had responded during the consultation period .
mr blunkett favours the scheme , but other ministers have already hinted the proposals could be abandoned .
