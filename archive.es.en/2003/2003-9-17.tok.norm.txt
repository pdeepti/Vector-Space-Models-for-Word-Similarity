european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .
experts predict that , by 2008 , up to 20 percent of the it budgets of germany ’ s largest companies will go to contracts with it providers in india , where costs are lower and workers highly educated , pouring a massive € 14 billion a year into the indian economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's asia trip highlights vital trade links german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .
experts predict that , by 2008 , up to 20 percent of the it budgets of germany ’ s largest companies will go to contracts with it providers in india , where costs are lower and workers highly educated , pouring a massive € 14 billion a year into the indian economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's asia trip highlights vital trade links german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .
in response , the country launched a four-billion-euro education investment program , which included the introduction of the country 's first all-day schools . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .

she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .
in response , the country launched a four-billion-euro education investment program , which included the introduction of the country 's first all-day schools . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”

dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?
want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers -lrb- sept .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .
experts predict that , by 2008 , up to 20 percent of the it budgets of germany ’ s largest companies will go to contracts with it providers in india , where costs are lower and workers highly educated , pouring a massive € 14 billion a year into the indian economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's asia trip highlights vital trade links german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .

" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .

during a visit to turkey on tuesday , german interior minister otto schily sought to obtain a guarantee that metin kaplan would get a fair trial in turkey .
following a meeting with turkey 's justice minister , schily said several issues remained unresolved .
the justice minister did promise that ankara would not use any evidence gained as a result of torture in any trial of kaplan , who is known to his followers in germany as the " caliph of cologne . "
ankara wants to try kaplan for allegedly plotting a terrorist attack in turkey in 1998 .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 public acceptance for genetic technology raises questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the bremen project is a true indicator , the public seems ready for genetic products .
with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 report blames school failures for dampening german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to make sure students complete their education .
the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .
in response , the country launched a four-billion-euro education investment program , which included the introduction of the country 's first all-day schools . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .
experts predict that , by 2008 , up to 20 percent of the it budgets of germany ’ s largest companies will go to contracts with it providers in india , where costs are lower and workers highly educated , pouring a massive € 14 billion a year into the indian economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's asia trip highlights vital trade links german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .

with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 public acceptance for genetic technology raises questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the bremen project is a true indicator , the public seems ready for genetic products .
with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 report blames school failures for dampening german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to make sure students complete their education .
the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .
in response , the country launched a four-billion-euro education investment program , which included the introduction of the country 's first all-day schools . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .

and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .
experts predict that , by 2008 , up to 20 percent of the it budgets of germany ’ s largest companies will go to contracts with it providers in india , where costs are lower and workers highly educated , pouring a massive € 14 billion a year into the indian economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's asia trip highlights vital trade links german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .

with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .

he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .

more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .

last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .
experts predict that , by 2008 , up to 20 percent of the it budgets of germany ’ s largest companies will go to contracts with it providers in india , where costs are lower and workers highly educated , pouring a massive € 14 billion a year into the indian economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's asia trip highlights vital trade links german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 public acceptance for genetic technology raises questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the bremen project is a true indicator , the public seems ready for genetic products .
with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?
want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers -lrb- sept .

with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?
want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 report blames school failures for dampening german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to make sure students complete their education .
the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .
in response , the country launched a four-billion-euro education investment program , which included the introduction of the country 's first all-day schools . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .

" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .

the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .
in response , the country launched a four-billion-euro education investment program , which included the introduction of the country 's first all-day schools . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .

dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .

we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 public acceptance for genetic technology raises questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the bremen project is a true indicator , the public seems ready for genetic products .
with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?
want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?
customers at a store in bremen were more than willing to do so , and hardly anyone questioned the company 's ethics , much to the dismay of the organizers -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 report blames school failures for dampening german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to make sure students complete their education .
the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .
study expected to accelerate reform pace the revelations of the oecd report , though not surprising to observers of german education policy , are likely to further fuel reforms to the country 's education system , which has been rocked by criticism in recent years .
in 2000 , the oecd issued an international schools survey that ranked german students 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy and shocked politicians and education policy experts out of their complacency .
in response , the country launched a four-billion-euro education investment program , which included the introduction of the country 's first all-day schools . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to all-day schools the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools across the country is just part of a € 4 billion investment program to boost education standards in germany that began on monday .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "

each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "

more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .
the move would also bring klm ’ s north american partners , northwest and continental , into the alliance with air france and delta airlines .
the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .
" in order to sell the new joint capacities there could well be fighting conditions on some of the new partners ' stretches , " westlb 's maass suggested . klaudia prevezanos send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools report lambastes german schools germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 report blames school failures for dampening german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to do more to make sure students complete their education .
the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .
the ability to attract those new teachers , the oecd cautioned , would be dependent on wage and working conditions .

but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .
spending less and getting less ?
the report also found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is - despite federal reform efforts - still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's educational expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schooling . -rrb-
lower spending has its consequences , too .
" if you take a look at what is available to students today , you have to see that the designated annual class time for pupils is 642 hours - notably lower than the oecd median , " said schleicher .
" there 's a second factor here , too : at the primary and secondary levels , the teacher-to-student ratio is very unfavorable . " in germany 's schools , there is one teacher for every 25 students , " the most unfavorable ratio in any of the oecd countries with comparable data , " according to schleicher .
chairwoman of the education union , gew , eva-maria stange accused politicians of setting the wrong priorities in budgetary policies .
" it can ’ t be , that building roads is more important than building schools , " stange told daily berliner zeitung .
she said germany needed to urgently invest more money in education .
" infexible salaries " and graying teachers at the same time stange urged a fundamental rethinking among teachers to counter the education crisis .
" we need more individual encouragement and attention in class and less assessments , grades and certificates , " she stressed .
schleicher said the report also raised questions about the personnel structure of the german school system .
" compared internationally , german teachers have a good base salary , but , interestingly , they have markedly less work-related bonuses , " schleicher said .
he added that the salary structure for german teachers is " too inflexible . "
but pay is n't the only issue state and federal governments must address - the graying of germany 's elementary school teachers is another problem raised by the oecd .
compared to other member states , in the first through tenth grades , germany has the oldest teachers - with 39.1 percent between the ages of 50 and 59 .
even with falling enrollments , the country still needs to prepare itself for considerable demand for new teachers in the near future .

the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn . the education at a glance 2003 report , released tuesday by the organization for economic cooperation and development , said significantly fewer german students are completing a university education than in other economically developed countries - a development that has seen germany 's economic fortunes sink as those of its neighbors in europe have grown .
in a handful of european countries - including the united kingdom and several scandinavian states - 30 percent of students go on to complete univversity , while in germany that figure is only 19 percent .
" despite a trend reversal , germany still lies at the bottom end of the spectrum , " andreas schleicher , oecd head of indicators and analysis , said in berlin tuesday .
" that goes for schools as well as universities and trainee- and apprenticeships .
if you look at the central things that successful countries do differently , there you see a highly diverse offering of qualifications today ...
there , they try to create a system of public education that , in a fundamental sense , allows supply and demand to mutually correct each other .
in other words : they offer flexibility . "
whereas the german economy has stagnated in recent years , an increasingly educated work force in other countries has led to considerable growth in productivity , schleicher said .
during the 1980s and 1990s , the number of students entering german universities was lower than in many more economically successful countries - including scandinavian countries , ireland , spain and korea - a factor that schleicher attributed to germany 's comparably lower growth in worker productivity .
he said , " in the last ten years , there has been no visible productivity in germany that can be explained by education . "
education " deficits " responding to the report on tuesday , the german government 's deputy minister for education and research wolf-michael catenhusen said " the study is disturbing " and conceded there are still deficiencies in germany 's education system .
he said it was the government ’ s goal to make education more attractive and added germany still " has a long way to go " before its education system can be considered the world 's best .
still , he said the report did identify success in the country 's recent bafög-reforms , which called for a 30 percent increase in the number of university students who receive federal financial aid .
catenhusen said the report pointed to a positive trend in that respect .
the percentage of students entering college increased by 4 percentage points between 1998 and 2001 , rising from 28 to 32 percent of students .
but even there the oecd report pointed to weaknesses , since the average for member states was 47 percent .
additionally , schleicher said , potential growth in the number of students entering university had largely been exhausted because so few students in germany are able to meet the prerequisites for higher education .
in germany , only 42 percent of students leaving school can enter university , compared to an oecd median of 57 percent .

european air carriers could be in for a shake-up .
air france and klm may soon close a merger deal that could spark a wave of takeovers in the industry . the well-sourced word in the media is that air france will announce a major partnership with dutch carrier klm , and possibly a complete merger , this friday .
the announcement , if it comes , will follow months of intense merger talks between the two flag-bearer airlines .
" these negotiations are in an advanced stage , " a spokesman for the company ’ s negotiators said on wednesday .
" however , critical points are still under discussion between the parties and further communication will follow as soon as an agreement is expected to be reached . "
but most industry believe the merger is already a done deal .
" an air france takeover of klm is imminent , " henrich maass , an equities analyst for westlb bank , told deutsche welle .
maass said he does n't expect the negotiations to be completed before the end of the year , but the two companies have finally indicated that talks are in an advanced stage .
even executives for air france , who has remained reserved up until now , are talking more openly about the likelihood of a merger now .
a new european market leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a merger could change the landscape of the european aviation industry .
" it would be the first takeover of a national airline by another -lsb- national airline -rsb- , " explained maass , who is responsible for westlb ’ s transportation and logistics coverage .
previously national carriers had only possessed marginal holdings in other flag carriers – like the minority stake british airways holds in spain ’ s iberia or air france ’ s partial ownership of italy ’ s alitalia .
the new air carrier would surpass the two most profitable airlines in europe – germany ’ s lufthansa , with € 17 billion -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- and british airways with around € 13 billion -lrb- $ 15 billion -rrb- in revenues in 2002 .
together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .
alliances between discount airlines ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to helping streamline the european market , the franco-dutch merger would make the skyteam airline alliance into the strongest in the world .

the star alliance with lufthansa and united airlines and oneworld with british airways and american airlines would be faced with a much bigger competitor .
" the skyteam airlines could be more strongly coordinated and also use their purchasing power better when buying new planes , " maass said , identifying advantages inherent to the deal .
meanwhile , czerwensky , a stock market expert for transportation and logistics firms , identified another possible effect : " one signal could be that -lsb- an air carrier -rsb- ca n't survive without an alliance .
mergers between european discount airlines - which have n't happened yet - would be conceivable . "
price wars expected in the short term , the real winner could be consumers , who could soon profit from an air france-klm merger .
the french and the dutch airlines share many destinations , which they wo n't be able to rationalize immediately .
so , to avoid competing for the same customers and to put the heat on rivals like lufthansa and british airways , they are likely to cut fares and trigger increased competition on the european market .

together , air france and klm had revenues totaling over € 19 billion -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- last year .
currently , lufthansa , british airways and air france carry roughly the same number of passengers .
a merger would easily make air france-klm europe ’ s largest airline .
the franco-dutch alliance could also surpass the world ’ s most prosperous airline , american airlines , which also recorded € 19 billion in revenues last year .
an oversaturated market " this fusion would be a breakthrough in consolidating the european transportation market , " said westlb ’ s maass .
insiders in the sector say there are too many national air carriers in europe .
a deal between the french and the dutch could have a snowball effect , with alitalia , swiss and iberia quickly becoming the next takeover candidates .
indeed , top managers from alitalia and air france already met on wednesday , a day after the french and italian prime ministers discussed the prospects of closer ties between the airlines .
" an important market effect would be that every country would no longer have its own airlines for the sake of prestige , " said robert czerwensky , an equities analyst at vereins- und westbank .
market experts believe air france will exchange 20 percent of its equity shares with klm ’ s dutch shareholders , making the french klm ’ s single largest shareholder .
in a welcome side-effect , the exchange of shares would also lower the french state 's stake in its national airline - still 54.4 percent - which had already been planned .
in the long term , analysts believe air france will absorb klm and its other smaller european partners to become one of the world 's biggest airlines .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .
" we export components for mercedes-benz , general motors , ford and other important global automakers , " he said .
" at the same time , we also urgently need to make sure that we take german mid-sized businesses by the hand in order to show them the right places and partners in india for investments . "
many would like to replicate the success of india ’ s it sector , which has strong ties to germany , in other industries .
experts predict that , by 2008 , up to 20 percent of the it budgets of germany ’ s largest companies will go to contracts with it providers in india , where costs are lower and workers highly educated , pouring a massive € 14 billion a year into the indian economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's asia trip highlights vital trade links german chancellor schröder has embarked on a five-day trip to southeast asia dominated by business talks with key trade partners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2003 public acceptance for genetic technology raises questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the bremen project is a true indicator , the public seems ready for genetic products .
with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?
want to design a baby or take a peek into your genetic future ?

with a dna design shop , a bremen project simulated the futue of gene technology and showed broad acceptance for the controversial issue .
dw-world spoke with the shop 's organizer about the implications of such a response . the “ chroma soma ” genetic shop project in bremen has opened the eyes of many people within the scientific , political and social sector .
with so many members of the public willing to believe that the experiment was an authentic establishment selling products which could allow parents to design their babies before birth , help clone individuals , eradicate genetic abnormalities and wipe clean dna traces , questions quickly arose on the subject of the public ’ s growing acceptance of this seemingly imminent technology . the project , a " field-study " organized by the bundeszentrale für politische bildung -lrb- federal center for political education -rrb- and leipzig-based artist alf thum , has caused quite a stir in the run-up to a congress on genetic research which began on tuesday in bremen .
deutsche welle talked to the president of the federal center for political education , thomas krüger , on the impact of the “ chroma soma ” project . the federal agency for civic education has worked together with “ chromo soma ” to open the first genetic product shop in germany .
what was the aim of the project ? “ chroma soma ” simulates a time when the genetic industry has products coming to the marketplace .
it is a ‘ business ’ that implies that in the near future , genetic goods will be of interest to consumers .
it is a mixture of the esoteric and professional , giving the customer an impression of attaining the product , when actually it may be some way from becoming available .
it offers products like “ book-a-baby ” which allows women to choose precisely when they wish to start a pregnancy , as well as selecting their baby 's genetic traits .
“ chroma soma ” serves as an illusion and an art project - the agency has worked closely with leipzig-based artist alf thum – but also as a wake-up call to the debate on genetics among the public . do you think the gene shop is something awaiting us in the future – or is it something you could imagine happening now ?
i can imagine that the time isn ’ t that far away for someone to enter the gene market .
acceptance among consumers may begin to grow .
next to information science , life science is going to play an important role in the 21st century .
an explosive number of processes are going to be set in motion .
that ’ s why , already at this stage , we need to determine how such a market should develop , what it should look like , and what it should be allowed to do and what it shouldn ’ t .
we also need to determine to what degree freedom in decision-making should be given to the individual in areas like preventative health measures for their own lives , healing illnesses and determining the genetic future of children .
that needs to be openly debated and negotiated .
how will these ‘ explosive ’ processes be regulated ?
they will surely be two-sided : on the positive , illnesses can be cured ; on the negative , there ’ s the danger that they will be open to abuse . we can get a grip on these problems through legal regulations and through procedural regulations .
one thing is certain , that the risk will just be reduced .
these new areas urgently need regulative order .
that is what the politicians require .
that is also what the medical practitioners and the geneticists require .
and , after all , it is also what the individual and our organization requires .
that is the reason for our involvement .
these procedures and laws must appear legitimate . the congress “ good genes , bad genes ” is taking place in bremen over the next few days to address this subject .
what do you expect from this congress ? with this congress , we are opening up these important and highly political questions to debate .
it is one of the principles of civic education to learn through conflict and controversy .
so people will have to come to a decision : what position do you support ?
the second important component of this congress is that the public is made aware of the implications of genetic technology . i am really amazed so many people visited “ chroma soma . ”
the analysis of that will be discussed at the congress .
i am very curious how the people there and the public as a whole will react . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de good genes , bad genes - a consumer choice ?

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "
focus on india part trade fair , part cultural showcase , the asia pacific weeks are a joint project of the german government , the city of berlin and german business leaders that was first organized in 1997 .
each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .
" this is why we should work together to use this potential for co-operation - for the mutual benefit of our two countries . "
opportunities for most industries the country also offers opportunities for more traditional german industries .
this year alone , economists are forecasting six-percent growth for the indian economy .
couple this with the fact that the indian middle class , with the consumer potential it entails , has grown in the past decade to 200-300 million people .
more than 40 million indians have been identified as potential customers for luxury goods .
hubert lienhard , incoming chairman of the asia-pacific economic committee of the german industry ’ s indian economic committee , told deutsche welle there are three sectors for which india should be particularly attractive : car manufacturers , road construction companies as well as facility builders .
and there ’ s still room for more engagement on the part of german businesses .
though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .
all are problems the indian government has acknowledged and is seeking to redress .
india seeks its share of pie just as germany is seeking to intensify its economic engagement with new delhi , india is seeking to do the same through greater technology transfer to germany .
arun bharat ram , chairman of the indian industry association cii says the main target for indian companies is germany ’ s small- to medium-sized businesses .

though german trade with india totaled € 5 billion in 2002 , industry leaders say there 's plenty of room for that figure to grow as a two-week long festival of german-asian cultural and business relations opens in berlin . calling asia one of the " fastest-growing markets of the future , " german chancellor gerhard schröder opened asia pacific weeks in berlin earlier this week – a bi-annual , two-week celebration of germany ’ s cultural and economic ties with asia .
" germany ’ s trade with asean countries in southeast asia is already bigger than germany ’ s trade with the united states .
and for many asian nations , germany is their most important trading partner in europe , " he continued .
exports to the asia pacific region account for around 12 percent of germany 's total foreign trade , according to government statistics from 2002 .
germany 's economics ministry is confident that this percentage could easily climb to 15 percent , and says a goal of 20 percent is " desirable . "

each time , a different country gets the spotlight - and this year , it 's india 's turn .
the chancellor admitted that trade relations with india - asia 's second-biggest nation - could be a lot stronger .
last year , germany 's trade volume with india totaled some € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- - less than a third of germany 's trade with china .
upcoming workshops on co-operations in the fields of science and technology could open up more business opportunities though , especially in environmental technologies .
" india is one of the world 's leading nations when it comes to using renewable energies , while germany is offering top quality products in this particular sector of technology , " schröder said .

though trade relations have traditionally been good between the two countries , german companies only made direct investments in india of € 50 million – a factor lienhard attributes to the weak state of the german economy .
one year earlier , he points out , the figure was € 200 million – but even that figure should have been higher .
lienhard says bureaucracy serves as one of the greatest barriers to german companies that want to do business in india .
additionally , many german investors are concerned about rampant corruption in the developing nation and often complain about the tangle of regulations that differ from province to province .

medical staff and scientists from the university of aberdeen , queen mary college , london , the university of manchester and south manchester university hospitals trust are taking part in a trial of the new equipment .
the cadet trial , which is being funded by cancer research uk , uses the r2 technology image checker computer to help detect potentially cancerous areas on mammograms .
the computer helps radiologists and radiographers in a similar way to a pc spellchecker by automatically detecting and prompting suspicious areas on mammograms .
researchers say it acts as a second pair of eyes and could help to make mammogram checks more accurate .
gold standard there are only three machines in the country but if trials at withington hospital 's nightingale centre prove successful then the image checker could become an integral part of breast cancer screening .
it is hoped the technology could reduce oversights and bring about earlier detection of cancerous lesions - both of which would reduce patient suffering and treatment costs .
suspicious masses and micro calcifications are indicated by different symbols , sized according to the degree of concern .
ultimately , it could replace the " gold standard " for breast screening , which involves a mammogram being checked by two expert radiologists or radiographers .
radiologist shortage professor fiona gilbert , head of radiology at the university of aberdeen said : " recent enhancements to the nhs breast screening programme , coupled with a natural increase in the eligible screening population , mean that screening volumes are set to increase dramatically .
" there is already a shortage of radiologists and radiographers and in the face of this burgeoning demand and we anticipate problems in delivering the service .
" this prompting technology needs to be examined ... as it could potentially provide a solution to the shortage . "

medical staff and scientists from the university of aberdeen , queen mary college , london , the university of manchester and south manchester university hospitals trust are taking part in a trial of the new equipment .
the cadet trial , which is being funded by cancer research uk , uses the r2 technology image checker computer to help detect potentially cancerous areas on mammograms .
the computer helps radiologists and radiographers in a similar way to a pc spellchecker by automatically detecting and prompting suspicious areas on mammograms .
researchers say it acts as a second pair of eyes and could help to make mammogram checks more accurate .
gold standard there are only three machines in the country but if trials at withington hospital 's nightingale centre prove successful then the image checker could become an integral part of breast cancer screening .
it is hoped the technology could reduce oversights and bring about earlier detection of cancerous lesions - both of which would reduce patient suffering and treatment costs .
suspicious masses and micro calcifications are indicated by different symbols , sized according to the degree of concern .
ultimately , it could replace the " gold standard " for breast screening , which involves a mammogram being checked by two expert radiologists or radiographers .
radiologist shortage professor fiona gilbert , head of radiology at the university of aberdeen said : " recent enhancements to the nhs breast screening programme , coupled with a natural increase in the eligible screening population , mean that screening volumes are set to increase dramatically .
" there is already a shortage of radiologists and radiographers and in the face of this burgeoning demand and we anticipate problems in delivering the service .
" this prompting technology needs to be examined ... as it could potentially provide a solution to the shortage . "

neuza maria magalhaes , who is 42 years old , does not have a home or a proper job .
neuza is excited about using her new atm card in order to survive she collects rubbish and sleeps in the streets , which means that officially she does not exist .
the brazilian government department that is responsible for the task of population census does not include street dwellers .
in spite of this , these people play a role in the informal economy .
the great majority of them collect paper , aluminium , iron and other recyclable materials .
the everyday sight of junk collectors , with their carts and their dogs is a part of the brazilian urban landscape .
up until now these people had never been able to have a bank account .
but the situation changed recently when a major brazilian banking institution created a simplified account that does not require proof of address or of income , and neuza is one of those who is enjoying this novelty .
" i make between 20 reais -lrb- £ 4 -rrb- and 50 reais -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- a day , it varies a lot , " says neuza .
" when i was in the street , i was n't able to keep anything .
i 'd buy a little gas stove to keep in my cart , and a gas canister , but people used to steal them .
" now , i put my money in the bank , " she adds , with a big grin , showing her atm bank card , which she does not even know how to use yet .
beyond expectations the bureaucracy-free account is already a success .
when it was launched in may , the expectation was that a total of 500,000 accounts would be opened across the whole country by the end of the year .
this number was reached at the end of august .
luiz is no longer afraid of being robbed in the street " research has shown for some time that there are around 25 million families that have no access to the financial system , no access to credit , " explains jorge matoso , president of caixa economica federal , the bank that is behind the scheme to encourage the social inclusion of street dwellers .
" this translates into a very large number of people , something like 50 million brazilians who could have access to the formal banking system , but did n't , " he adds .
" as well as not having any fixed address , a large number of those who are economically active in brazil work on an informal basis , and thus have no proof of income . "
plans for the future luiz fabio is 28 years old and has been collecting rubbish for recycling for five years now .
unlike most of the junk collectors , who have dogs as pets , luiz has a rabbit called wilbur .
he says he felt discriminated against because he did n't have a bank account , and that beforehand he had to hide his money inside his clothes , as he was always afraid of being robbed .
marcio dreams of renting a home and having a family now , that he can save money , he is able to make some modest plans for the future .
" my aim is to rent a small house , furnish it , and have a little corner of my own , where i can live and be a member of society .
both me and my rabbit , " says luiz , affectionately stroking wilbur .
there is no single cause that leads people to end up living in the streets .
among the various reasons are unemployment , alcoholism , drug addiction , mental health problems , abandonment and family disagreements .
getting a bank account seems to represent a way out for rubbish collectors looking for a better life .
" everything 's improved because now i can save money , and maybe a few days from now i can get off the streets , rent a home and have a family , you know , " says 22 year-old marcio ferreira batista , with a smile .
" that 's my dream , to have a family of my own . "
neuza , who has lived in the streets for as long as she can remember , and to whom basic necessities are a luxury , has the same idea .
" now that i have somewhere to keep my money , maybe i will be able to rent an apartment , one that has water and electricity , " she says , hopefully .

" now , i put my money in the bank , " she adds , with a big grin , showing her atm bank card , which she does not even know how to use yet .
beyond expectations the bureaucracy-free account is already a success .
when it was launched in may , the expectation was that a total of 500,000 accounts would be opened across the whole country by the end of the year .
this number was reached at the end of august .
" research has shown for some time that there are around 25 million families that have no access to the financial system , no access to credit , " explains jorge matoso , president of caixa economica federal , the bank that is behind the scheme to encourage the social inclusion of street dwellers .
" this translates into a very large number of people , something like 50 million brazilians who could have access to the formal banking system , but did n't , " he adds .
" as well as not having any fixed address , a large number of those who are economically active in brazil work on an informal basis , and thus have no proof of income . "
plans for the future luiz fabio is 28 years old and has been collecting rubbish for recycling for five years now .
unlike most of the junk collectors , who have dogs as pets , luiz has a rabbit called wilbur .
he says he felt discriminated against because he did n't have a bank account , and that beforehand he had to hide his money inside his clothes , as he was always afraid of being robbed .
now , that he can save money , he is able to make some modest plans for the future .
" my aim is to rent a small house , furnish it , and have a little corner of my own , where i can live and be a member of society .
both me and my rabbit , " says luiz , affectionately stroking wilbur .
there is no single cause that leads people to end up living in the streets .
among the various reasons are unemployment , alcoholism , drug addiction , mental health problems , abandonment and family disagreements .
getting a bank account seems to represent a way out for rubbish collectors looking for a better life .
" everything 's improved because now i can save money , and maybe a few days from now i can get off the streets , rent a home and have a family , you know , " says 22 year-old marcio ferreira batista , with a smile .
" that 's my dream , to have a family of my own . "
neuza , who has lived in the streets for as long as she can remember , and to whom basic necessities are a luxury , has the same idea .
" now that i have somewhere to keep my money , maybe i will be able to rent an apartment , one that has water and electricity , " she says , hopefully .

government plans , published on wednesday , could also include staggering school timetables to ease congestion during peak hours .
local education authorities are being urged to help by working with parents to draw up " travel plans " , involving safer routes , more road crossings , lower speed limits and cycle paths .

the value of the destroyed bikes is put at £ 8m , but many of the machines are irreplaceable .
the destruction could have been worse - scores of bikes were pushed to safety by museum staff and delegates at a business conference on the city .
fire experts at the scene on wednesday quickly determined the cause of the fire which has left 70 % of the building a blackened shell .
history of motorcycling speaking from the scene to bbc midlands today , west midlands fire service spokesman dave glenis said the fire started outside the building in boxes of old air conditioning units .
" it appears that this is very close to the area where people smoke .
" it was the careless disposal of a cigarette into those boxes .
that 's why the fire spread so rapidly through the building .
the museum charted the history of the uk motorcycle industry in pictures " we are not treating the incident as arson at this stage and believe it was purely an accident , " he said .
more than 120 firefighters tackled the fire which could be seen for 15 miles around .
the bikes destroyed in the collection traced the history of the british motorcycle industry and many of the museum 's rarest exhibits were among those lost .
exhibits included bsa gold stars , sunbeam twins , dmw hornets and triumph racers .
but museum bosses have vowed that the museum will be rebuilt and hopes remain that some of the damaged bikes could be saved .
neil payne , competition and demonstrations manager at the museum , said : " i am sure that it will rise , like the proverbial phoenix , from the ashes .
" at the moment we do not know whether the bikes are destroyed beyond redemption .
damage assessed " we keep thinking it 's a bad dream and we are going to wake up .
" this is a huge loss to british heritage . "
staff at the museum were said to be " absolutely devastated " .
it is a devastating loss , not just to me , but for the country as a whole museum owner roy richards a museum spokesman said : " over 300 of the exhibits in the museum have been saved .
" sadly , three of the museum 's five exhibit halls have been destroyed along with their exhibits .
" a full assessment of the damage is being undertaken with a view to getting operations under way again as soon as possible .

the value of the destroyed bikes is put at £ 8m , but many of the machines are irreplaceable .
the destruction could have been worse - scores of bikes were pushed to safety by museum staff and delegates at a business conference on the city .
fire experts at the scene on wednesday quickly determined the cause of the fire which has left 70 % of the building a blackened shell .
history of motorcycling speaking from the scene to bbc midlands today , west midlands fire service spokesman dave glenis said the fire started outside the building in boxes of old air conditioning units .
" it appears that this is very close to the area where people smoke .
" it was the careless disposal of a cigarette into those boxes .
that 's why the fire spread so rapidly through the building .
the museum charted the history of the uk motorcycle industry in pictures " we are not treating the incident as arson at this stage and believe it was purely an accident , " he said .
more than 120 firefighters tackled the fire which could be seen for 15 miles around .
the bikes destroyed in the collection traced the history of the british motorcycle industry and many of the museum 's rarest exhibits were among those lost .
exhibits included bsa gold stars , sunbeam twins , dmw hornets and triumph racers .
but museum bosses have vowed that the museum will be rebuilt and hopes remain that some of the damaged bikes could be saved .
neil payne , competition and demonstrations manager at the museum , said : " i am sure that it will rise , like the proverbial phoenix , from the ashes .
" at the moment we do not know whether the bikes are destroyed beyond redemption .
damage assessed " we keep thinking it 's a bad dream and we are going to wake up .
" this is a huge loss to british heritage . "
staff at the museum were said to be " absolutely devastated " .
it is a devastating loss , not just to me , but for the country as a whole museum owner roy richards a museum spokesman said : " over 300 of the exhibits in the museum have been saved .
" sadly , three of the museum 's five exhibit halls have been destroyed along with their exhibits .
" a full assessment of the damage is being undertaken with a view to getting operations under way again as soon as possible .
" many irreplaceable machines will have been damaged in the fire , but they will be restored once again , to their original showroom condition . "

officers from the environment agency are now working to save thousands more thought to be at risk .
water samples have been taken for analysis from a 150-metre stretch of the canal , close to kidlington green lock .
but agency officials say it is likely the recent hot weather is responsible for a large growth in algae which has cut the amount of oxygen in the water .
aerators have been installed along the banks to try to pump oxygen into the canal .

the two airlines are in the advanced stages of negotiating klm 's entry into the skyteam group , a statement said on wednesday .
air france - which already has ties with us carrier delta air lines and italy 's alitalia in the skyteam marketing alliance - has been trying for months to recruit klm .
there is speculation that the french and dutch airlines may go even further , perhaps striking a comprehensive deal in which the two would hold one another 's shares .
prime minister silvio berlusconi has promised a speedy privatisation of alitalia , so the airline is not left out in the cold .
during a telephone conversation with the french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin on tuesday both " agreed that the development of alliances via the consolidation of european companies constituted a common goal for economic policy " , his office said .
' more mergers ' klm has already made several failed attempts to merge with british airways and walked away at the last minute from a deal with alitalia in 2000 .
the airline was reported on wednesday to be requiring more time to negotiate the deal which focuses on maintaining klm 's brand , its dutch identity , schiphol airport as a hub and its partnership with us airlines .
european airlines need to retain their national identities because of bilateral aviation agreements between their governments and third countries which govern where airlines can fly .
however , analysts see more alliances in the future once the bilateral rules dating back more than half a century are modified .
the european commission has gained the mandate to negotiate with the us to replace all the bilateral transatlantic agreements with a single pan-european deal .

if confusion surrounds when the reporter and scientist first met - mr gilligan says early 2001 , dr kelly believed it was september 2002 - it pales in significance compared to the debate over who said what at their crucial meeting on 22 may 2003 .
the meeting led directly to mr gilligan reporting claims that the government , and more specifically alastair campbell , had " sexed up " september 's iraq dossier with the assertion weapons of mass destruction could be launched in 45 minutes .
help with pdf files download and install the reader here when he gave evidence to the foreign affairs committee on 15 july , dr kelly said mr gilligan was the first to mention both the 45 minutes claim and mr campbell .
that was backed up by dr kelly 's friend olivia bosch in her evidence to the hutton inquiry , when she referred to mr gilligan playing a " name game " at the meeting .

and mr gilligan has conceded to the hutton inquiry that dr kelly " adopted " his use of the word " sexier " , although in evidence to parliament 's intelligence and security committee on 16 july , dr kelly appears to suggest it was " possible " he used the word first .
but the bbc reporter was adamant in his inquiry evidence that dr kelly was the first to raise the 45 minute issue and to use the word " campbell " , and that he even checked his quotes back with the scientist before they parted .

what dr kelly did not know during his evidence to mps on 15 july was that two of its members had been briefed by mr gilligan , who had himself already appeared before them .

however , mr gilligan subsequently submitted a fresh written statement to the inquiry , which reportedly says he was not sure dr kelly was ms watts ' source .

documents submitted to the inquiry have revealed how even on the same day mr gilligan 's report went out , the today programme started looking back at how it was handled .

but the mod was also unhappy , believing it was not told about the substance of mr gilligan 's report when today contacted it the evening before broadcast .
the bbc rejected that claim too , with director of news richard sambrook detailing in a letter on 29 june a series of phone calls he said were made to the mod on 28 may that culminated in confirmation that armed forces minister adam ingram would respond to mr gilligan 's " wmd " report the next morning .
when defence secretary geoff hoon met mr sambrook 11 days later , the mod 's minutes record mr sambrook as accepting fault on the issue and apologising .
but in evidence to the inquiry , the bbc executive said he had only offered to apologise if the bbc was found to be at fault .
at the same meeting with the defence secretary , the minutes record mr sambrook speculating on mr gilligan 's future , saying " we are thinking about the best use for andrew " without taking him off today .

on 9 june , as the full-blown row between the bbc and the government was getting underway , mr marsh remarked in an e-mail how alastair campbell was " on the run .
or gone bonkers .
or both " .
but 18 days later , in another e-mail to mr mitchell , the today editor describes mr gilligan 's story as " a good piece of investigative journalism marred by flawed reporting " .
changes to his working practices were also mooted .
yet the same day , 27 june , mr sambrook mounted a stout defence of mr gilligan 's reporting in a letter to alastair campbell , and in evidence to the inquiry said the " flawed reporting " remark was not the bbc 's " considered view " .
click to return how did the bbc 's governors deal with the row ?
in a 29 june e-mail seeking governors ' views on the row , bbc chairman gavyn davies made clear his determination not to " buckle in the face of government pressure " , saying it was a moment for the governors to " stand and be counted " .
in reply most governors expressed support , but minutes of their emergency meeting a week later reveal a number of reservations .
resolve and reservations 29 june : gavyn davies e-mail to governors -lrb- pdf file 17kb -rrb- 6 july : minutes of governors ' meeting -lrb- pdf file 528kb -rrb- most notably there was a suggestion they should not offer immediate support to the bbc 's management but should instead begin a review of the corporation 's war coverage using outside experts led by director general greg dyke .
some governors apparently wondered whether today had been " naïve " to broadcast the item without expecting a powerful reaction , and should therefore have been " more careful " in consulting the government beforehand .
it emerged during the inquiry that the governors had also not been made aware of kevin marsh 's e-mail referring to mr gilligan 's " flawed reporting " , although in an echo of his director of news , mr davies justified it on the grounds it was not the " considered judgment " of bbc news .
in the end the governors ' 6 july statement reflected some of the concerns - for example , that 10 downing street should have been asked for a response before mr gilligan 's report went out - but otherwise fully backed the corporation 's journalists and managers .
the next day tony blair and gavyn davies spoke on the phone in a failed attempt to broker peace .
the following morning in a speech greg dyke appealed for both sides to " agree to disagree " but hours later the mod revealed one of its officials had come forward admitting contact with mr gilligan , and the controversy was re-ignited .
concerns continue 12-14 july : gavyn davies / pauline neville-jones e-mail exchange -lrb- pdf file 191kb -rrb- 7 july : gavyn davies e-mail to governors -lrb- pdf file 65kb -rrb- meanwhile some governors ' worries continued behind the scenes .
one , former joint intelligence committee chairman pauline neville-jones , conducted her own research into dr kelly and concluded the governors ' 6 july statement was wrong to describe him as a " senior intelligence source " .
in his 14 july reply to her , gavyn davies reveals how the phrase was erroneously inserted " at the last minute by a pr person - the way of the world ! " .
he concedes the statement was drafted in haste , having earlier - in an e-mail to governors on 7 july - justified speed on the grounds of meeting newspaper deadlines .
the internal misgivings continued , with minutes of a governors ' meeting on 17 july recording concern about bbc journalists as " news creators " rather than reporters .
the director general warned them against assuming such journalists could not be impartial .

in a 29 june e-mail seeking governors ' views on the row , bbc chairman gavyn davies made clear his determination not to " buckle in the face of government pressure " , saying it was a moment for the governors to " stand and be counted " .

some governors apparently wondered whether today had been " naïve " to broadcast the item without expecting a powerful reaction , and should therefore have been " more careful " in consulting the government beforehand .
it emerged during the inquiry that the governors had also not been made aware of kevin marsh 's e-mail referring to mr gilligan 's " flawed reporting " , although in an echo of his director of news , mr davies justified it on the grounds it was not the " considered judgment " of bbc news .
in the end the governors ' 6 july statement reflected some of the concerns - for example , that 10 downing street should have been asked for a response before mr gilligan 's report went out - but otherwise fully backed the corporation 's journalists and managers .
the next day tony blair and gavyn davies spoke on the phone in a failed attempt to broker peace .
the following morning in a speech greg dyke appealed for both sides to " agree to disagree " but hours later the mod revealed one of its officials had come forward admitting contact with mr gilligan , and the controversy was re-ignited .

he concedes the statement was drafted in haste , having earlier - in an e-mail to governors on 7 july - justified speed on the grounds of meeting newspaper deadlines .
the internal misgivings continued , with minutes of a governors ' meeting on 17 july recording concern about bbc journalists as " news creators " rather than reporters .
the director general warned them against assuming such journalists could not be impartial .

who said what during andrew gilligan 's meeting with david kelly ?
if confusion surrounds when the reporter and scientist first met - mr gilligan says early 2001 , dr kelly believed it was september 2002 - it pales in significance compared to the debate over who said what at their crucial meeting on 22 may 2003 .

at the time the bbc was publicly not naming dr kelly as the source for any of its stories , and in the same e-mail mr gilligan said as far as the identity of his own source was concerned " we are not ruling anyone in or out " .

e-mail to committee member 14 july : andrew gilligan 's e-mail to david chidgey -lrb- pdf file 97kb -rrb- in an e-mail forwarded to liberal democrat david chidgey , mr gilligan suggests questions for dr kelly that , he said , could prove " devastating " for the government .
he also names dr kelly as the source who told newsnight colleague susan watts the 45 minute claim had been " seized on " and " got out of all proportion " by those writing the september dossier .
at the time the bbc was publicly not naming dr kelly as the source for any of its stories , and in the same e-mail mr gilligan said as far as the identity of his own source was concerned " we are not ruling anyone in or out " .
however , mr gilligan subsequently submitted a fresh written statement to the inquiry , which reportedly says he was not sure dr kelly was ms watts ' source .

documents submitted to the inquiry have revealed how even on the same day mr gilligan 's report went out , the today programme started looking back at how it was handled .

the bbc rejected that claim too , with director of news richard sambrook detailing in a letter on 29 june a series of phone calls he said were made to the mod on 28 may that culminated in confirmation that armed forces minister adam ingram would respond to mr gilligan 's " wmd " report the next morning .
when defence secretary geoff hoon met mr sambrook 11 days later , the mod 's minutes record mr sambrook as accepting fault on the issue and apologising .

but 18 days later , in another e-mail to mr mitchell , the today editor describes mr gilligan 's story as " a good piece of investigative journalism marred by flawed reporting " .
changes to his working practices were also mooted .
yet the same day , 27 june , mr sambrook mounted a stout defence of mr gilligan 's reporting in a letter to alastair campbell , and in evidence to the inquiry said the " flawed reporting " remark was not the bbc 's " considered view " .

in a 29 june e-mail seeking governors ' views on the row , bbc chairman gavyn davies made clear his determination not to " buckle in the face of government pressure " , saying it was a moment for the governors to " stand and be counted " .
in reply most governors expressed support , but minutes of their emergency meeting a week later reveal a number of reservations .

some governors apparently wondered whether today had been " naïve " to broadcast the item without expecting a powerful reaction , and should therefore have been " more careful " in consulting the government beforehand .
it emerged during the inquiry that the governors had also not been made aware of kevin marsh 's e-mail referring to mr gilligan 's " flawed reporting " , although in an echo of his director of news , mr davies justified it on the grounds it was not the " considered judgment " of bbc news .
in the end the governors ' 6 july statement reflected some of the concerns - for example , that 10 downing street should have been asked for a response before mr gilligan 's report went out - but otherwise fully backed the corporation 's journalists and managers .
the next day tony blair and gavyn davies spoke on the phone in a failed attempt to broker peace .
the following morning in a speech greg dyke appealed for both sides to " agree to disagree " but hours later the mod revealed one of its officials had come forward admitting contact with mr gilligan , and the controversy was re-ignited .

one , former joint intelligence committee chairman pauline neville-jones , conducted her own research into dr kelly and concluded the governors ' 6 july statement was wrong to describe him as a " senior intelligence source " .
in his 14 july reply to her , gavyn davies reveals how the phrase was erroneously inserted " at the last minute by a pr person - the way of the world ! " .
he concedes the statement was drafted in haste , having earlier - in an e-mail to governors on 7 july - justified speed on the grounds of meeting newspaper deadlines .
the internal misgivings continued , with minutes of a governors ' meeting on 17 july recording concern about bbc journalists as " news creators " rather than reporters .
the director general warned them against assuming such journalists could not be impartial .

the hutton inquiry has now shed an enormous amount of light on how the report was put together and dealt with after it was broadcast and how the governors , the bbc 's ruling body , reacted behind the scenes .

how did dr kelly get asked about his contacts with susan watts ?

who said what during andrew gilligan 's meeting with david kelly ?
if confusion surrounds when the reporter and scientist first met - mr gilligan says early 2001 , dr kelly believed it was september 2002 - it pales in significance compared to the debate over who said what at their crucial meeting on 22 may 2003 .
the meeting led directly to mr gilligan reporting claims that the government , and more specifically alastair campbell , had " sexed up " september 's iraq dossier with the assertion weapons of mass destruction could be launched in 45 minutes .
help with pdf files download and install the reader here when he gave evidence to the foreign affairs committee on 15 july , dr kelly said mr gilligan was the first to mention both the 45 minutes claim and mr campbell .
that was backed up by dr kelly 's friend olivia bosch in her evidence to the hutton inquiry , when she referred to mr gilligan playing a " name game " at the meeting .
dr kelly 's daughter rachel said her father was " incredulous " that mr gilligan made such " forceful claims " based on their conversation .

and mr gilligan has conceded to the hutton inquiry that dr kelly " adopted " his use of the word " sexier " , although in evidence to parliament 's intelligence and security committee on 16 july , dr kelly appears to suggest it was " possible " he used the word first .
but the bbc reporter was adamant in his inquiry evidence that dr kelly was the first to raise the 45 minute issue and to use the word " campbell " , and that he even checked his quotes back with the scientist before they parted .

economic development minister andrew davies welcomed the jobs this year alone more than £ 3.5bn has been invested or will be invested in the sector in wales .
this includes £ 500m at airbus uk and some £ 70m by the defence aviation repair agency -lrb- dara -rrb- at st athan .
the welsh aerospace industry employs more than 20,000 people in companies ranging from large multi-nationals to niche specialists .
mr davies said it was particularly appropriate the conference was being held in wales , which already has 10 % of the uk aerospace industry , and is home to six of the world 's top 20 aerospace companies including airbus , bae systems , general dynamics , general electric , raytheon and thales .
new investment in august the welsh development agency -lrb- wda -rrb- revealed it had paid £ 8m for more than 800 acres of land earmarked for an aerospace business park .
the purchase of ministry of defence land at st athan , near cardiff , paved the way for jet repair units providing thousands of highly-skilled jobs .
but last week , doubts over the long-term future of the dara plant , also in st athan , were raised after the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- published recommendations which could overhaul the way the raf 's jets are repaired .
the review recommended splitting the raf maintenance work done at dara between front-line military bases .
dara , which repairs harrier and tornado jets for the raf and employs about 2,100 people , depends on the raf for contracts .
but mr davies said on wednesday that the investment in dara would continue .
he added : " adam ingram -lrb- uk armed forces minister -rrb- has made it very clear indeed that they would n't have invested this vast amount of money if they were n't committed . "
dara repairs raf aircraft the maintenance repair and overhaul -lrb- mro -rrb- europe conference in cardiff is the largest aerospace event of its kind in the world attracting more than 1,100 industry delegates from around the globe .
wda chief executive graham hawker said the mro europe conference at cardiff international arena was a good opportunity to showcase expertise .
he said : " our main objectives are to stimulate new business opportunities , to position wales as a centre of aerospace excellence and to inform key decision makers of the strategic opportunities that wales has to offer , such as st athan . "
but peace campaigners have condemned it for promoting the arms trade .
ray davies , vice-chair of cnd cymru , told bbc radio wales he was furious the exhibition was taking place .
" i 'm bitterly disappointed with the wda for supporting the event , but i 'm more disappointed with our assembly members , " he said .
" it 's an immoral industry - a murderous industry - and it 's one we do n't want in wales at all . "
around 100 protesters including members of the green party , plaid cymru and cnd picketed the conference on tuesday .

the third party is caught in a classic catch 22 .
people do n't vote for them in large enough numbers to elect them because they do n't think people will vote for them in large enough numbers to elect them .

charles kennedy born : 25 november 1959 elected : 1983 as mp for ross , cromarty and skye -lrb- now ross , skye and inverness west -rrb- leadership : succeeded paddy ashdown as liberal democrat leader in 1999 high : helping his party to make gains in the 2001 general election , prompting talk of the lib dems as growing opposition force .
low : questions about his commitment to the role of leader surfaced last year .
his supporters see that as either the typically po faced attitude of those who believe politicians should always walk around with faces like wet weekends - or part of the campaign by would-be leaders and others to destabilise him .
for the punters , of course , it seems to work wonders .
hard slog it shows he is not only a real person but that he is actually a rather interesting person with , heaven forbid , a sense of humour and a life .
his appearances on programmes such as " have i got news for you " are mocked by the po face brigade .
but they have ensured he is recognised in the street , something few politicians , let alone lib dems can claim .
and , needless to say , the caricature is just that .
the idea that he does n't put in the hard slog , for example , was comprehensively blown apart by his performance in the last general election campaign .
lib dems stood against war he hit the road running , or more accurately flying , and while the other leaders were still getting up to speed he had already visited just about every constituency in britain in one afternoon .
and his approachable , self-deprecating style won him more friends , leading to one of the best ever performances for his party .
good bloke mr kennedy has been a career politician since his triumph in capturing a seat for the sdp aged 23 in 1983 .
he became leader of the liberal democrats in 1999 after building a reputation as a high-flier in his party , including four years as president .
since becoming leader , he has managed to carve out some distinct policies for the lib dems , most notably on taxation , while still just about avoiding the charge that the party is more left wing than the government .
and most recently he struck a chord with voters with his anti-war stance .
but does any of this amount to anything other than the fact that the third party has a good bloke leading it ?
the lib dems - or their liberal or alliance predecessors - have apparently been on the verge of the big breakthrough more times than arnold schwarzenegger has " been back " .
former leader david steel infamously told his 1981 party conference to " go out and prepare for government " .
and mr kennedy 's action man predecessor paddy ashdown did a deal with new labour that nearly put him in the post-1997 cabinet .
and at last year 's conference , mr kennedy predicted the next general election fight would be between his party and labour .
fed up but can he really pull off what none of his predecessors have managed ?
the third party is caught in a classic catch 22 .
people do n't vote for them in large enough numbers to elect them because they do n't think people will vote for them in large enough numbers to elect them .
it is the dilemma every third party leader has faced .
thanks to growing disillusion with new labour and a flatlining tory party , things do look better than usual for the lib dems .
and the brent east by-election result emphasises that to a huge degree .
mr kennedy 's task is to capitalise on that and persuade those fed up voters that he is not just a good bloke , but a potential prime minister .

the venerable bede church of england school should have opened on 8 september but building works also overshot a second opening date last friday .
staff and governors at the so-called " super school " have said that the best is worth waiting for with a building and facilities fit for the 21st century .
but the schools 370 pupils have to wait for the school 's high-tech restaurant , complete with iris scanners to charge for meals , to be finished .
other hi-tech equipment at the school includes interactive whiteboards .
' trailblazing ' technology david meakin , chair of the school governors , said : " -lsb- for £ 14m -rsb- you get a school for the future which is going to provide the best possible education for the young people of this area . "
" i think we are blazing a trail in terms of technology .
some of the equipment going in , we are either the first or second school in the world to have it installed .
" the educational benefits of what we are seeking to do will be recognised in time by a lot of people and they will seek to follow our lead . "
mr meakin said their highly-publicised eye scanners would help pupils .
he added : " it is not big brother , it is not a security system , it is simply a way of recognising people and processing them quickly and to pay for school meals .
" it has the added advantage of ensuring that those who are on free school meals will appear no different to everyone else and does away with one of the stigmas that a lot of pupils have felt . "
