the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .
until then , radio oasis can continue to broadcast its neo-nazi message - at the expense of taxpayers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country .

germany currently budgets about 1.5 percent for its military .
" there is no hope for the u.s. to meet -lrb- international -rrb- threats on our own , " burns said .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .

germany currently budgets about 1.5 percent for its military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.11.2003 germany : the trade fair capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a drop in attendance , events like the cebit technology fair still remain in germany despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .
though attendance is down , events like cebit and the frankfurt book fair are still pushing full steam ahead . germany is a country of trade fairs , it 's a tradition that has spanned more than 800 years .
and there are signs of it everywhere . at the train stations and airports in most major cities here , signs guide visitors to the nearest trade fair center .
with cities like frankfurt and leipzig serving as major crossroads to other business centers in europe , german trade fair organizers have successfully cashed in on the country 's central location .
the expansion of the trades and also the economic miracle that occurred after world war ii all contributed to germany 's establishment as the global leader in trade fairs .
today , frankfurt , düsseldorf , hanover , munich , cologne , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , essen , leipzig and hamburg host the world 's leading trade fairs in an astonishing number of industry and service sectors .
global market leader in fact , two-thirds of the leading international fairs are hosted in germany .
in cologne , the international food industry gathers each year for the anuga fair , bicycle manufacturers converge for ifma , and photo and imaging companies display their latest wares at photokino .
in berlin , the tourism industry swaps shop secrets at the itb fair , and consumer electronics-makers swap gizmos and cut deals at the ifa , the world 's biggest event of its kind . frankfurt is home to the world 's largest publishing industry event , the frankfurt book fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle famira-parcsetich , an employee of german publishing house heyne arranges books at their stand at the frankfurt , germany bookfair , on tuesday , oct .
8 , 2002 .
the fair will run from oct .
9 , until oct .
14 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / bernd kammerer -rrb- other cities have established themselves in the niche fair market .
each year düsseldorf plays host to companies engaged in all things nautical , with the successful international boat show ; the igedo fashion trade fair , which brings together germany 's leading designers ; as well as the medica , the world 's largest medical industry convention .
stuttgart and essen also host numerous trade fairs .
unforgettable , of course , is the international toy fair in nuremberg , a city long associated with the holiday season because of its famous annual christmas market .
10 million visitors together , germany 's 140 nationwide trade fairs and exhibitions attract 160,000 exhibitors , who rent a total of 6.5 million square meters of floorspace .
they also draw between 9 and 10 million visitors , according to the berlin-based association of the german trade fair industry -lrb- auma -rrb- .that 's almost a quarter of the entire european market .
the european association of trade fairs -lrb- emeca -rrb- estimates that , europe-wide , 1,000 trade fairs are held each year , drawing about 40 million visitors .

13 through sept .
21 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- among them is frankfurt 's international motor show , which has an enormous influence on the auto market .
on average , about 1 million visitors stroll through the stands of the fair 's 1,100 exhibitors .
berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .
cruising through the crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet world messe in berlin vom 4. bis 6 .
uni 2002 still , in the time of one of the worst economic crises germany has experienced since world war ii , the trade fair industry is n't without its problems .
in 2002 , the number of people who visited cebit , the world 's largest computer fair , dropped by 20 percent .
berlin suspended its internet world fair after the number of exhibitors in 2002 fell by 30 percent .
the city also cancelled its 2002 auto fair aaa after failing to attract enough car-makers .
most fairs fared considerably better .
overall in germany , the number of exhibitors at major trade fairs fell by 2 percent and the number of visitors by 5 percent , according to auma statistics .
the worst may be yet to come .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that 23 percent of 500 german companies that currently exhibit are considering plans to reduce their trade fair presence .
only 12 percent of the companies polled said they planned to increase their trade fair activities .
still , there have been some success stories in the midst of the slumbering economy .
berlin 's recent venus fair for the adult entertainment industry attracted 300 exhibitors from 21 countries making it " not only the most lucrative , but also the most international erotic fair in the world , " the financial times deutschland recently reported .
the service sector is also experiencing growth .
in 2001 , the amount of space rented out at services exhibitions grew by 5.9 percent and the number of exhibitors by 13.2 percent .
industry experts say , however , that , stagnant economy aside , there are few threats to germany 's international dominance in the trade fairs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .

though attendance is down , events like cebit and the frankfurt book fair are still pushing full steam ahead . germany is a country of trade fairs , it 's a tradition that has spanned more than 800 years .
and there are signs of it everywhere . at the train stations and airports in most major cities here , signs guide visitors to the nearest trade fair center .
with cities like frankfurt and leipzig serving as major crossroads to other business centers in europe , german trade fair organizers have successfully cashed in on the country 's central location .
the expansion of the trades and also the economic miracle that occurred after world war ii all contributed to germany 's establishment as the global leader in trade fairs .
today , frankfurt , düsseldorf , hanover , munich , cologne , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , essen , leipzig and hamburg host the world 's leading trade fairs in an astonishing number of industry and service sectors .
global market leader in fact , two-thirds of the leading international fairs are hosted in germany .
in cologne , the international food industry gathers each year for the anuga fair , bicycle manufacturers converge for ifma , and photo and imaging companies display their latest wares at photokino .
in berlin , the tourism industry swaps shop secrets at the itb fair , and consumer electronics-makers swap gizmos and cut deals at the ifa , the world 's biggest event of its kind . frankfurt is home to the world 's largest publishing industry event , the frankfurt book fair .

-lrb- ap photo / bernd kammerer -rrb- other cities have established themselves in the niche fair market .
each year düsseldorf plays host to companies engaged in all things nautical , with the successful international boat show ; the igedo fashion trade fair , which brings together germany 's leading designers ; as well as the medica , the world 's largest medical industry convention .
stuttgart and essen also host numerous trade fairs .
unforgettable , of course , is the international toy fair in nuremberg , a city long associated with the holiday season because of its famous annual christmas market .
10 million visitors together , germany 's 140 nationwide trade fairs and exhibitions attract 160,000 exhibitors , who rent a total of 6.5 million square meters of floorspace .
they also draw between 9 and 10 million visitors , according to the berlin-based association of the german trade fair industry -lrb- auma -rrb- .that 's almost a quarter of the entire european market .
the european association of trade fairs -lrb- emeca -rrb- estimates that , europe-wide , 1,000 trade fairs are held each year , drawing about 40 million visitors .

21 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- among them is frankfurt 's international motor show , which has an enormous influence on the auto market .
on average , about 1 million visitors stroll through the stands of the fair 's 1,100 exhibitors .
berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .
cruising through the crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet world messe in berlin vom 4. bis 6 .
uni 2002 still , in the time of one of the worst economic crises germany has experienced since world war ii , the trade fair industry is n't without its problems .
in 2002 , the number of people who visited cebit , the world 's largest computer fair , dropped by 20 percent .
berlin suspended its internet world fair after the number of exhibitors in 2002 fell by 30 percent .
the city also cancelled its 2002 auto fair aaa after failing to attract enough car-makers .
most fairs fared considerably better .
overall in germany , the number of exhibitors at major trade fairs fell by 2 percent and the number of visitors by 5 percent , according to auma statistics .
the worst may be yet to come .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that 23 percent of 500 german companies that currently exhibit are considering plans to reduce their trade fair presence .
only 12 percent of the companies polled said they planned to increase their trade fair activities .
still , there have been some success stories in the midst of the slumbering economy .
berlin 's recent venus fair for the adult entertainment industry attracted 300 exhibitors from 21 countries making it " not only the most lucrative , but also the most international erotic fair in the world , " the financial times deutschland recently reported .
the service sector is also experiencing growth .
in 2001 , the amount of space rented out at services exhibitions grew by 5.9 percent and the number of exhibitors by 13.2 percent .
industry experts say , however , that , stagnant economy aside , there are few threats to germany 's international dominance in the trade fairs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.11.2003 state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far right extremists can tune into radio oasis with impunity in denmark steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .
the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .
until then , radio oasis can continue to broadcast its neo-nazi message - at the expense of taxpayers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.11.2003 germany : the trade fair capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a drop in attendance , events like the cebit technology fair still remain in germany despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .
though attendance is down , events like cebit and the frankfurt book fair are still pushing full steam ahead . germany is a country of trade fairs , it 's a tradition that has spanned more than 800 years .
and there are signs of it everywhere . at the train stations and airports in most major cities here , signs guide visitors to the nearest trade fair center .
with cities like frankfurt and leipzig serving as major crossroads to other business centers in europe , german trade fair organizers have successfully cashed in on the country 's central location .
the expansion of the trades and also the economic miracle that occurred after world war ii all contributed to germany 's establishment as the global leader in trade fairs .
today , frankfurt , düsseldorf , hanover , munich , cologne , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , essen , leipzig and hamburg host the world 's leading trade fairs in an astonishing number of industry and service sectors .
global market leader in fact , two-thirds of the leading international fairs are hosted in germany .
in cologne , the international food industry gathers each year for the anuga fair , bicycle manufacturers converge for ifma , and photo and imaging companies display their latest wares at photokino .
in berlin , the tourism industry swaps shop secrets at the itb fair , and consumer electronics-makers swap gizmos and cut deals at the ifa , the world 's biggest event of its kind . frankfurt is home to the world 's largest publishing industry event , the frankfurt book fair .

the fair will run from oct .
9 , until oct .

-lrb- ap photo / bernd kammerer -rrb- other cities have established themselves in the niche fair market .
each year düsseldorf plays host to companies engaged in all things nautical , with the successful international boat show ; the igedo fashion trade fair , which brings together germany 's leading designers ; as well as the medica , the world 's largest medical industry convention .
stuttgart and essen also host numerous trade fairs .
unforgettable , of course , is the international toy fair in nuremberg , a city long associated with the holiday season because of its famous annual christmas market .
10 million visitors together , germany 's 140 nationwide trade fairs and exhibitions attract 160,000 exhibitors , who rent a total of 6.5 million square meters of floorspace .
they also draw between 9 and 10 million visitors , according to the berlin-based association of the german trade fair industry -lrb- auma -rrb- .that 's almost a quarter of the entire european market .
the european association of trade fairs -lrb- emeca -rrb- estimates that , europe-wide , 1,000 trade fairs are held each year , drawing about 40 million visitors .

13 through sept .
21 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- among them is frankfurt 's international motor show , which has an enormous influence on the auto market .
on average , about 1 million visitors stroll through the stands of the fair 's 1,100 exhibitors .
berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .
cruising through the crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet world messe in berlin vom 4. bis 6 .
uni 2002 still , in the time of one of the worst economic crises germany has experienced since world war ii , the trade fair industry is n't without its problems .
in 2002 , the number of people who visited cebit , the world 's largest computer fair , dropped by 20 percent .
berlin suspended its internet world fair after the number of exhibitors in 2002 fell by 30 percent .
the city also cancelled its 2002 auto fair aaa after failing to attract enough car-makers .
most fairs fared considerably better .
overall in germany , the number of exhibitors at major trade fairs fell by 2 percent and the number of visitors by 5 percent , according to auma statistics .
the worst may be yet to come .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that 23 percent of 500 german companies that currently exhibit are considering plans to reduce their trade fair presence .
only 12 percent of the companies polled said they planned to increase their trade fair activities .
still , there have been some success stories in the midst of the slumbering economy .
berlin 's recent venus fair for the adult entertainment industry attracted 300 exhibitors from 21 countries making it " not only the most lucrative , but also the most international erotic fair in the world , " the financial times deutschland recently reported .
the service sector is also experiencing growth .
in 2001 , the amount of space rented out at services exhibitions grew by 5.9 percent and the number of exhibitors by 13.2 percent .
industry experts say , however , that , stagnant economy aside , there are few threats to germany 's international dominance in the trade fairs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.11.2003 state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far right extremists can tune into radio oasis with impunity in denmark steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .
the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .
until then , radio oasis can continue to broadcast its neo-nazi message - at the expense of taxpayers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .
until then , radio oasis can continue to broadcast its neo-nazi message - at the expense of taxpayers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country .

though attendance is down , events like cebit and the frankfurt book fair are still pushing full steam ahead . germany is a country of trade fairs , it 's a tradition that has spanned more than 800 years .
and there are signs of it everywhere . at the train stations and airports in most major cities here , signs guide visitors to the nearest trade fair center .
with cities like frankfurt and leipzig serving as major crossroads to other business centers in europe , german trade fair organizers have successfully cashed in on the country 's central location .
the expansion of the trades and also the economic miracle that occurred after world war ii all contributed to germany 's establishment as the global leader in trade fairs .
today , frankfurt , düsseldorf , hanover , munich , cologne , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , essen , leipzig and hamburg host the world 's leading trade fairs in an astonishing number of industry and service sectors .
global market leader in fact , two-thirds of the leading international fairs are hosted in germany .
in cologne , the international food industry gathers each year for the anuga fair , bicycle manufacturers converge for ifma , and photo and imaging companies display their latest wares at photokino .
in berlin , the tourism industry swaps shop secrets at the itb fair , and consumer electronics-makers swap gizmos and cut deals at the ifa , the world 's biggest event of its kind . frankfurt is home to the world 's largest publishing industry event , the frankfurt book fair .

each year düsseldorf plays host to companies engaged in all things nautical , with the successful international boat show ; the igedo fashion trade fair , which brings together germany 's leading designers ; as well as the medica , the world 's largest medical industry convention .
stuttgart and essen also host numerous trade fairs .
unforgettable , of course , is the international toy fair in nuremberg , a city long associated with the holiday season because of its famous annual christmas market .
10 million visitors together , germany 's 140 nationwide trade fairs and exhibitions attract 160,000 exhibitors , who rent a total of 6.5 million square meters of floorspace .
they also draw between 9 and 10 million visitors , according to the berlin-based association of the german trade fair industry -lrb- auma -rrb- .that 's almost a quarter of the entire european market .
the european association of trade fairs -lrb- emeca -rrb- estimates that , europe-wide , 1,000 trade fairs are held each year , drawing about 40 million visitors .

-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- among them is frankfurt 's international motor show , which has an enormous influence on the auto market .
on average , about 1 million visitors stroll through the stands of the fair 's 1,100 exhibitors .
berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .
cruising through the crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet world messe in berlin vom 4. bis 6 .
uni 2002 still , in the time of one of the worst economic crises germany has experienced since world war ii , the trade fair industry is n't without its problems .
in 2002 , the number of people who visited cebit , the world 's largest computer fair , dropped by 20 percent .
berlin suspended its internet world fair after the number of exhibitors in 2002 fell by 30 percent .
the city also cancelled its 2002 auto fair aaa after failing to attract enough car-makers .
most fairs fared considerably better .
overall in germany , the number of exhibitors at major trade fairs fell by 2 percent and the number of visitors by 5 percent , according to auma statistics .
the worst may be yet to come .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that 23 percent of 500 german companies that currently exhibit are considering plans to reduce their trade fair presence .
only 12 percent of the companies polled said they planned to increase their trade fair activities .
still , there have been some success stories in the midst of the slumbering economy .
berlin 's recent venus fair for the adult entertainment industry attracted 300 exhibitors from 21 countries making it " not only the most lucrative , but also the most international erotic fair in the world , " the financial times deutschland recently reported .
the service sector is also experiencing growth .
in 2001 , the amount of space rented out at services exhibitions grew by 5.9 percent and the number of exhibitors by 13.2 percent .
industry experts say , however , that , stagnant economy aside , there are few threats to germany 's international dominance in the trade fairs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

today , frankfurt , düsseldorf , hanover , munich , cologne , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , essen , leipzig and hamburg host the world 's leading trade fairs in an astonishing number of industry and service sectors .
global market leader in fact , two-thirds of the leading international fairs are hosted in germany .
in cologne , the international food industry gathers each year for the anuga fair , bicycle manufacturers converge for ifma , and photo and imaging companies display their latest wares at photokino .
in berlin , the tourism industry swaps shop secrets at the itb fair , and consumer electronics-makers swap gizmos and cut deals at the ifa , the world 's biggest event of its kind . frankfurt is home to the world 's largest publishing industry event , the frankfurt book fair .

the fair will run from oct .

-lrb- ap photo / bernd kammerer -rrb- other cities have established themselves in the niche fair market .
each year düsseldorf plays host to companies engaged in all things nautical , with the successful international boat show ; the igedo fashion trade fair , which brings together germany 's leading designers ; as well as the medica , the world 's largest medical industry convention .
stuttgart and essen also host numerous trade fairs .
unforgettable , of course , is the international toy fair in nuremberg , a city long associated with the holiday season because of its famous annual christmas market .
10 million visitors together , germany 's 140 nationwide trade fairs and exhibitions attract 160,000 exhibitors , who rent a total of 6.5 million square meters of floorspace .
they also draw between 9 and 10 million visitors , according to the berlin-based association of the german trade fair industry -lrb- auma -rrb- .that 's almost a quarter of the entire european market .
the european association of trade fairs -lrb- emeca -rrb- estimates that , europe-wide , 1,000 trade fairs are held each year , drawing about 40 million visitors .

the 60th iaa opens its doors to the public sept .
13 through sept .
21 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- among them is frankfurt 's international motor show , which has an enormous influence on the auto market .
on average , about 1 million visitors stroll through the stands of the fair 's 1,100 exhibitors .
berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .
cruising through the crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet world messe in berlin vom 4. bis 6 .
uni 2002 still , in the time of one of the worst economic crises germany has experienced since world war ii , the trade fair industry is n't without its problems .
in 2002 , the number of people who visited cebit , the world 's largest computer fair , dropped by 20 percent .
berlin suspended its internet world fair after the number of exhibitors in 2002 fell by 30 percent .
the city also cancelled its 2002 auto fair aaa after failing to attract enough car-makers .
most fairs fared considerably better .
overall in germany , the number of exhibitors at major trade fairs fell by 2 percent and the number of visitors by 5 percent , according to auma statistics .
the worst may be yet to come .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that 23 percent of 500 german companies that currently exhibit are considering plans to reduce their trade fair presence .
only 12 percent of the companies polled said they planned to increase their trade fair activities .
still , there have been some success stories in the midst of the slumbering economy .
berlin 's recent venus fair for the adult entertainment industry attracted 300 exhibitors from 21 countries making it " not only the most lucrative , but also the most international erotic fair in the world , " the financial times deutschland recently reported .
the service sector is also experiencing growth .
in 2001 , the amount of space rented out at services exhibitions grew by 5.9 percent and the number of exhibitors by 13.2 percent .
industry experts say , however , that , stagnant economy aside , there are few threats to germany 's international dominance in the trade fairs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .

though attendance is down , events like cebit and the frankfurt book fair are still pushing full steam ahead . germany is a country of trade fairs , it 's a tradition that has spanned more than 800 years .
and there are signs of it everywhere . at the train stations and airports in most major cities here , signs guide visitors to the nearest trade fair center .
with cities like frankfurt and leipzig serving as major crossroads to other business centers in europe , german trade fair organizers have successfully cashed in on the country 's central location .
the expansion of the trades and also the economic miracle that occurred after world war ii all contributed to germany 's establishment as the global leader in trade fairs .

berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .

only 12 percent of the companies polled said they planned to increase their trade fair activities .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .

it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .

under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.11.2003 germany : the trade fair capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a drop in attendance , events like the cebit technology fair still remain in germany despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .
though attendance is down , events like cebit and the frankfurt book fair are still pushing full steam ahead . germany is a country of trade fairs , it 's a tradition that has spanned more than 800 years .
and there are signs of it everywhere . at the train stations and airports in most major cities here , signs guide visitors to the nearest trade fair center .
with cities like frankfurt and leipzig serving as major crossroads to other business centers in europe , german trade fair organizers have successfully cashed in on the country 's central location .
the expansion of the trades and also the economic miracle that occurred after world war ii all contributed to germany 's establishment as the global leader in trade fairs .
today , frankfurt , düsseldorf , hanover , munich , cologne , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , essen , leipzig and hamburg host the world 's leading trade fairs in an astonishing number of industry and service sectors .
global market leader in fact , two-thirds of the leading international fairs are hosted in germany .
in cologne , the international food industry gathers each year for the anuga fair , bicycle manufacturers converge for ifma , and photo and imaging companies display their latest wares at photokino .
in berlin , the tourism industry swaps shop secrets at the itb fair , and consumer electronics-makers swap gizmos and cut deals at the ifa , the world 's biggest event of its kind . frankfurt is home to the world 's largest publishing industry event , the frankfurt book fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle famira-parcsetich , an employee of german publishing house heyne arranges books at their stand at the frankfurt , germany bookfair , on tuesday , oct .

the fair will run from oct .
9 , until oct .
14 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / bernd kammerer -rrb- other cities have established themselves in the niche fair market .
each year düsseldorf plays host to companies engaged in all things nautical , with the successful international boat show ; the igedo fashion trade fair , which brings together germany 's leading designers ; as well as the medica , the world 's largest medical industry convention .
stuttgart and essen also host numerous trade fairs .
unforgettable , of course , is the international toy fair in nuremberg , a city long associated with the holiday season because of its famous annual christmas market .
10 million visitors together , germany 's 140 nationwide trade fairs and exhibitions attract 160,000 exhibitors , who rent a total of 6.5 million square meters of floorspace .
they also draw between 9 and 10 million visitors , according to the berlin-based association of the german trade fair industry -lrb- auma -rrb- .that 's almost a quarter of the entire european market .
the european association of trade fairs -lrb- emeca -rrb- estimates that , europe-wide , 1,000 trade fairs are held each year , drawing about 40 million visitors .

the 60th iaa opens its doors to the public sept .
13 through sept .
21 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- among them is frankfurt 's international motor show , which has an enormous influence on the auto market .
on average , about 1 million visitors stroll through the stands of the fair 's 1,100 exhibitors .
berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .
cruising through the crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet world messe in berlin vom 4. bis 6 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.11.2003 state funding of danish right-wing radio stirs debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far right extremists can tune into radio oasis with impunity in denmark steps are being considered to change a law that allows a far-right radio station to operate in denmark under the protection of the government .
the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .
until then , radio oasis can continue to broadcast its neo-nazi message - at the expense of taxpayers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country .

but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .
until then , radio oasis can continue to broadcast its neo-nazi message - at the expense of taxpayers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country .

but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .

the expansion of the trades and also the economic miracle that occurred after world war ii all contributed to germany 's establishment as the global leader in trade fairs .
today , frankfurt , düsseldorf , hanover , munich , cologne , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , essen , leipzig and hamburg host the world 's leading trade fairs in an astonishing number of industry and service sectors .

on average , about 1 million visitors stroll through the stands of the fair 's 1,100 exhibitors .
berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .

uni 2002 still , in the time of one of the worst economic crises germany has experienced since world war ii , the trade fair industry is n't without its problems .
in 2002 , the number of people who visited cebit , the world 's largest computer fair , dropped by 20 percent .
berlin suspended its internet world fair after the number of exhibitors in 2002 fell by 30 percent .
the city also cancelled its 2002 auto fair aaa after failing to attract enough car-makers .
most fairs fared considerably better .
overall in germany , the number of exhibitors at major trade fairs fell by 2 percent and the number of visitors by 5 percent , according to auma statistics .
the worst may be yet to come .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that 23 percent of 500 german companies that currently exhibit are considering plans to reduce their trade fair presence .
only 12 percent of the companies polled said they planned to increase their trade fair activities .
still , there have been some success stories in the midst of the slumbering economy .
berlin 's recent venus fair for the adult entertainment industry attracted 300 exhibitors from 21 countries making it " not only the most lucrative , but also the most international erotic fair in the world , " the financial times deutschland recently reported .
the service sector is also experiencing growth .
in 2001 , the amount of space rented out at services exhibitions grew by 5.9 percent and the number of exhibitors by 13.2 percent .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .
culture minister mikkelsen wants the law to be changed so the radio station isn ’ t guaranteed automatic protection .
but he isn ’ t sure whether that will happen before 2005 .
until then , radio oasis can continue to broadcast its neo-nazi message - at the expense of taxpayers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.11.2003 germany : the trade fair capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a drop in attendance , events like the cebit technology fair still remain in germany despite its economic crisis , germany has maintained its position as the world 's premier trade fair location .
though attendance is down , events like cebit and the frankfurt book fair are still pushing full steam ahead . germany is a country of trade fairs , it 's a tradition that has spanned more than 800 years .
and there are signs of it everywhere . at the train stations and airports in most major cities here , signs guide visitors to the nearest trade fair center .
with cities like frankfurt and leipzig serving as major crossroads to other business centers in europe , german trade fair organizers have successfully cashed in on the country 's central location .
the expansion of the trades and also the economic miracle that occurred after world war ii all contributed to germany 's establishment as the global leader in trade fairs .
today , frankfurt , düsseldorf , hanover , munich , cologne , berlin , nuremberg , stuttgart , essen , leipzig and hamburg host the world 's leading trade fairs in an astonishing number of industry and service sectors .
global market leader in fact , two-thirds of the leading international fairs are hosted in germany .
in cologne , the international food industry gathers each year for the anuga fair , bicycle manufacturers converge for ifma , and photo and imaging companies display their latest wares at photokino .
in berlin , the tourism industry swaps shop secrets at the itb fair , and consumer electronics-makers swap gizmos and cut deals at the ifa , the world 's biggest event of its kind . frankfurt is home to the world 's largest publishing industry event , the frankfurt book fair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isabelle famira-parcsetich , an employee of german publishing house heyne arranges books at their stand at the frankfurt , germany bookfair , on tuesday , oct .

the fair will run from oct .
9 , until oct .
14 , 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / bernd kammerer -rrb- other cities have established themselves in the niche fair market .
each year düsseldorf plays host to companies engaged in all things nautical , with the successful international boat show ; the igedo fashion trade fair , which brings together germany 's leading designers ; as well as the medica , the world 's largest medical industry convention .
stuttgart and essen also host numerous trade fairs .
unforgettable , of course , is the international toy fair in nuremberg , a city long associated with the holiday season because of its famous annual christmas market .
10 million visitors together , germany 's 140 nationwide trade fairs and exhibitions attract 160,000 exhibitors , who rent a total of 6.5 million square meters of floorspace .
they also draw between 9 and 10 million visitors , according to the berlin-based association of the german trade fair industry -lrb- auma -rrb- .that 's almost a quarter of the entire european market .
the european association of trade fairs -lrb- emeca -rrb- estimates that , europe-wide , 1,000 trade fairs are held each year , drawing about 40 million visitors .

13 through sept .
21 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / jens meyer -rrb- among them is frankfurt 's international motor show , which has an enormous influence on the auto market .
on average , about 1 million visitors stroll through the stands of the fair 's 1,100 exhibitors .
berlin 's tourism fair , itb , meanwhile , drew 10,000 exhibitors in 2002 and 122,000 visitors .
hanover 's cebit it fair drew a massive 673,000 visitors to its 400,000 square meters of exhibition space in 2002 .
it 's figures like that which put germany in the trade fair pole position .
the fairs also draw scores of visitors from other countries .
for the first time ever , according to auma , in 2002 at least 20 percent of all visitors to german trade fairs were foreigners , mostly from other european countries .
they come to germany because massive trade fairs are fewer and far between in europe and abroad .
but some cities do compete successfully against the german market .
milan is well known for its fashion trade fair and for its metals industry fair , emo , which is hosted alternating years by the italian industrial center and hanover .
a number of successful specialist fairs are also held in birmingham , england , and barcelona .
paris is renowned for its prêt-a-porter fashion shows as well as the international air and space show .
automobile fairs in detroit , geneva and tokyo are also international draws .
but even industrial giants like the united states and japan have few trade fairs that serve as international magnets like those in germany , a shortcoming shared by european capitals like rome , madrid , moscow , vienna and brussels .
cruising through the crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet world messe in berlin vom 4. bis 6 .
uni 2002 still , in the time of one of the worst economic crises germany has experienced since world war ii , the trade fair industry is n't without its problems .
in 2002 , the number of people who visited cebit , the world 's largest computer fair , dropped by 20 percent .
berlin suspended its internet world fair after the number of exhibitors in 2002 fell by 30 percent .
the city also cancelled its 2002 auto fair aaa after failing to attract enough car-makers .
most fairs fared considerably better .
overall in germany , the number of exhibitors at major trade fairs fell by 2 percent and the number of visitors by 5 percent , according to auma statistics .
the worst may be yet to come .
a recent survey by pollster emnid found that 23 percent of 500 german companies that currently exhibit are considering plans to reduce their trade fair presence .
only 12 percent of the companies polled said they planned to increase their trade fair activities .
still , there have been some success stories in the midst of the slumbering economy .
berlin 's recent venus fair for the adult entertainment industry attracted 300 exhibitors from 21 countries making it " not only the most lucrative , but also the most international erotic fair in the world , " the financial times deutschland recently reported .
the service sector is also experiencing growth .
in 2001 , the amount of space rented out at services exhibitions grew by 5.9 percent and the number of exhibitors by 13.2 percent .
industry experts say , however , that , stagnant economy aside , there are few threats to germany 's international dominance in the trade fairs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

the case has forced people to ask how far danish free speech should go . freedom of the press and freedom of speech are two of the most fundamental rights in any democracy , and in denmark these rights are vehemently upheld .
but lately , danes are wondering how far that freedom should go . the debate has been sparked by public outrage over radio oasis , a private radio station that broadcasts uncensored , right-wing extremist propaganda with funding and protection provided by the danish government .
transmitting from the nation ’ s capital , radio oasis sounds important and official , especially when you consider that the station comes under the umbrella of the state broadcasting remit .
but those who tune into it will most likely hear songs by neo-nazi bands , alongside calls to protect what the station perceives to be “ the pure , white race of danes ” against those of different race , religion and sexual orientation .
law guarantees state funds the main point of concern for the majority of danes is that the station can send out racist propaganda from the center of copenhagen without any fear of legal recriminations .
denmark has a law guaranteeing state funds for non-commercial radio and television stations .
under that provision , radio oasis receives a yearly subsidy from the state , which totals nearly 50 percent of the station ’ s yearly expenses .
the government has done so every year since 1997 .
“ this year , we got a support payment of 78,000 danish krone , equal to € 10,000 .
exactly the same as we got over the last few years , ” said jonni hansen , the station chief and leader of denmark ’ s right-wing extremist party , dnsb , which also supplies propaganda material to german neo-nazi groups .
in effect , the danish government pays for the distribution of hansen ’ s national socialist propaganda .
“ radio oasis gets exactly the same amount of funding as all the other local stations for the amount of time they are on air , ” erik nordahl svendsen , media secretary at the culture ministry , said , explaining the rational behind the funding .
nazi symbolism not outlawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station has not gone unchallenged , however .
back in 1996 , when radio oasis prepared to begin broadcasting , the local authorities attempted to prevent the national socialist 's efforts to meet the deadline for stations wishing to obtain a broacasting license .
that action was thwarted by the station and broadcasting began .
later attempts , on the grounds of the station ’ s use of nazi imagery and its message of extremist propaganda , also failed as the promotion of such things is not illegal in denmark .
the laws in neighbouring germany are very different .
any expression of nazi ideas , or use of symbolism and images , are outlawed and carry possible jail sentences .
sharing a border with a country that provides a climate , however grudgingly , where such behaviour is allowed can be inflammatory , since german neo-nazis can also tune into the station . radio oasis even broadcasted a live reading of excerpts from adolf hitler ’ s mein kampf referring to the nazi leader ’ s views on the jews .
but it escaped punishment after a special juristic committee of the ministry of culture determined that the station was within its right to broadcast such things under the danish free speech rules , even though they violated a danish anti-racial discrimination law .
culture minister calls for change in recent months , as outrage over the station ’ s content has grown , culture minister brian mikkelsen has continuously called for the purse strings to be cut .
“ i find it insane and even grotesque that a nazi promoting radio station gets money from the government .
it has to stop , ” he said .
the fact that hansen and his dnsb party are able to use the airwaves of radio oasis for its own political views is an embarrassment for the danish government .

the move came as washington warned that terrorists might be planning to hijack cargo aircraft overseas and crash them into targets in america .
in particular , officials responsible for safety at nuclear plants , bridges and dams have been made aware of the potential threat .
but the authorities admit the suggestion has come from a single source and has so far not been corroborated .
terrorist funding the us secretary of state colin powell in an interview with a london-based saudi newspaper ash-sharq al-awsat has said he thinks the saudi authorities could do more to combat terror .
saudi arabia could make greater efforts in pursuing the sources of terrorist funding , he told the newspaper .
state department spokesman richard boucher on friday said fears of an imminent attack in the kingdom meant it was " prudent ... to warn americans and to close our operations for a review . "
the us embassy in riyadh , as well as the missions in jeddah and dhahran , were closed on saturday .
" we will take it day by day , " said a us embassy official when asked when the operations would re-open .
us sites in saudi arabia have previously been targeted by attackers .
call for vigilance the us embassy in riyadh said it " continues to receive credible information that terrorists in saudi arabia have moved from the planning to operational phase of planned attacks in the kingdom . "
the statement said : " the embassy strongly urges all american citizens in the kingdom to be especially vigilant when in any area that is perceived to be american or western . "
britain , canada and australia last month issued similar alerts which angered saudi officials , who say they have made important strides in fighting terror inside the country .
spate of trouble saudi police in mecca recently uncovered a suspected al-qaeda cell believed to be planning attacks .
saudis grapple with change on thursday , two suspected members of the cell blew themselves up apparently to avoid arrest , while a third suspect was shot dead by security forces in riyadh .
in may 35 people were killed in suicide attacks on a western compound in riyadh .
" we 're very much on guard , very much aware of what 's going on .
i 'm extremely wary , " david castillo , vice-president of a telecoms company in saudi arabia told reuters news agency .
in 1996 , 25 american servicemen were killed when a truck packed with explosives blew up close to a us military base in dhahran .

the minister responsible for animal health , ben bradshaw , told the bbc that farmers would be consulted on the issue soon .
he said he expected opposition from some following his decision to stop killing badgers , which are suspected of spreading the disease .
his comments were made on radio 4 's farming today this week programme .
farmers have described the decision to halt badger culling in areas surrounding farms where there have been outbreaks of bovine tb as " a dereliction of duty " .
epidemic fears it is estimated that bovine tb could cost taxpayers up to £ 1bn in compensation to uk farmers .
just last month , vets ordered the slaughter of an entire herd of cattle on a farm in lanarkshire following an outbreak of the disease .
cases are mostly dealt with by killing only the infected animals and monitoring the rest . "
what is needed is more control of infected badgers , not less " anthony gibson , national farmers ' union but vets have warned of the potential for an epidemic unless farmers exercise the utmost caution when buying animals from high-risk areas .
farmers are supposed to receive the market value for an animal hit with tb .
mr bradshaw suspended the culling of badgers earlier this week after new tests suggested it was counterproductive in the battle against bovine tb .
the trials found that when carried out in reaction to a tb outbreak , the practice led to an increase in the disease .
anthony gibson , of the national farmers ' union in south-west england , says his members feel as if they are being left with no solution to a problem that is ruining their lives and businesses .
" what is needed is more control of infected badgers , not less , " he said .
but dr elaine king , of the federation of badger groups , applauded mr bradshaw 's decision and forecast that all culling would eventually be proved to be wrong .
proactive culling continues in 1998 , the independent scientific group on cattle tuberculosis was appointed by the government to design and oversee a large-scale field trial aimed at evaluating badger culling as a way of reducing the incidence of tb in cattle .
the krebs trials cover 10 areas across the country - five of them in the south west - as well as locations in herefordshire , staffordshire and derbyshire .
the areas are divided into three .
in the first , the badgers are culled immediately -lrb- proactive culling -rrb- ; in the second , they are killed if there is an outbreak of tb -lrb- reactive culling -rrb- ; and in the third zone , the badgers are left alone .
mr bradshaw said proactive culling would continue because the data for these areas did not yet yield a statistically significant result .

epidemic fears it is estimated that bovine tb could cost taxpayers up to £ 1bn in compensation to uk farmers .
just last month , vets ordered the slaughter of an entire herd of cattle on a farm in lanarkshire following an outbreak of the disease .

what is needed is more control of infected badgers , not less anthony gibson , national farmers ' union but vets have warned of the potential for an epidemic unless farmers exercise the utmost caution when buying animals from high-risk areas .
farmers are supposed to receive the market value for an animal hit with tb .
mr bradshaw suspended the culling of badgers earlier this week after new tests suggested it was counterproductive in the battle against bovine tb .
the trials found that when carried out in reaction to a tb outbreak , the practice led to an increase in the disease .
anthony gibson , of the national farmers ' union in south-west england , says his members feel as if they are being left with no solution to a problem that is ruining their lives and businesses .

proactive culling continues in 1998 , the independent scientific group on cattle tuberculosis was appointed by the government to design and oversee a large-scale field trial aimed at evaluating badger culling as a way of reducing the incidence of tb in cattle .
the krebs trials cover 10 areas across the country - five of them in the south west - as well as locations in herefordshire , staffordshire and derbyshire .
the areas are divided into three .
in the first , the badgers are culled immediately -lrb- proactive culling -rrb- ; in the second , they are killed if there is an outbreak of tb -lrb- reactive culling -rrb- ; and in the third zone , the badgers are left alone .
mr bradshaw said proactive culling would continue because the data for these areas did not yet yield a statistically significant result .

attacks can happen without users opening an attachment but net security experts are now predicting a growth in attacks that strike when people are simply browsing messages or the web .
these security threats exploit vulnerabilities in microsoft 's internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- browser .
some take the form of fake online bank e-mail messages requesting secure information or that direct people to bogus sites .
russ cooper , chief scientist at security specialist trusecure , said the risk of such attacks would grow as long as e-mail messages were written that used the html formatting more usually used to create webpages .
hidden and dangerous mr cooper said the threat from maliciously formed html was increasing and was being used to damage , disrupt or collect sensitive information about users and their computers .
" looking at future threatscapes , we are expecting an increasing number of attacks which exploit vulnerabilities in ie , " he said .
" these are exploited through html e-mails , and the nature of html is that it obscures what 's underneath . "
as more people have accounts online , there are more opportunities for someone to pretend to be an entity and collect information from you russ cooper , trusecure the malformed html can be in the body of an e-mail message or be unleashed when users go to websites which look legitimate but have been set with malicious intent .
e-mail messages bearing html can be anything from graphic intensive company newsletters to links that entice people to websites .
because the malicious code is not in an attachment , there is very little the average computer user can do unless they have the latest e-mail programs which block scripts or they examine e-mail coding .
mr cooper said html viruses , such as qhost , were becoming more common .
qhost used a loophole in microsoft 's browser that granted them the ability to plant their own code on a victim 's computer .
con artists have targetted customers of online banks when users went to certain search sites this allowed a pop-up ad to run underneath their main browser window , and set off a flurry of pop-up ads as well as installing programs onto it .
" if i sent you an e-mail with a link to a website in it , and you click on the link , i could have used the exploit that qhost used to install anything on your computer , " said mr cooper .
" depending on what e-mail program you were using , i may have been able to do that without you even clicking on the link . "
for mr cooper qhost marks a significant shift from viruses that cause system failures and inconvenience .
" in this case , they were trying to make money off you through ads , which is not what viruses normally do . "
graham cluley , sophos security analyst , thinks although these kinds of attacks are a threat they can be defended against by making sure your copy of internet explorer is updated .
" anti-spam companies are also increasingly treating html e-mails as suspicious " he said , " and legitimate e-mail marketers are beginning to see the backlash and are working against html . "
but even though browser flaws are fixable with downloadable patches , virus writers were constantly finding different methods to attack , making the patching job harder , said mr cooper .
big fakes other maliciously formed html attacks have targeted customers of online banks .
in these scams , e-mails are sent to customers asking them to go to the bank 's website to verify passwords and other confidential information .
the e-mails were fake and the website was a replica , but customers would not know that unless they actually examined the code behind the plausible looking message and webpage .
" this is going to occur more frequently , " warns mr cooper .
" as more people have accounts online , there are more opportunities for someone to pretend to be an entity and collect information from you , " says mr cooper .
but those behind the scams do not know what online bank customers use , said mr cluley , who advises people to ignore e-mails that purport to be from them and phone your bank instead .
by adding your online bank to your browser favourites ensure you are always going to the legitimate website .
" but we get so many html e-mails from people we know and do want , that to say ' if it 's html based then i am going to delete ' it is not realistic , " says mr cooper .
" microsoft continue running around chasing their tails in the hope that they can keep html e-mail secure enough , but we think that is going to be harder to do in the future . "

russ cooper , chief scientist at security specialist trusecure , said the risk of such attacks would grow as long as e-mail messages were written that used the html formatting more usually used to create webpages .
hidden and dangerous mr cooper said the threat from maliciously formed html was increasing and was being used to damage , disrupt or collect sensitive information about users and their computers .
" looking at future threatscapes , we are expecting an increasing number of attacks which exploit vulnerabilities in ie , " he said .
" these are exploited through html e-mails , and the nature of html is that it obscures what 's underneath . "
as more people have accounts online , there are more opportunities for someone to pretend to be an entity and collect information from you russ cooper , trusecure the malformed html can be in the body of an e-mail message or be unleashed when users go to websites which look legitimate but have been set with malicious intent .
e-mail messages bearing html can be anything from graphic intensive company newsletters to links that entice people to websites .
because the malicious code is not in an attachment , there is very little the average computer user can do unless they have the latest e-mail programs which block scripts or they examine e-mail coding .
mr cooper said html viruses , such as qhost , were becoming more common .
qhost used a loophole in microsoft 's browser that granted them the ability to plant their own code on a victim 's computer .
con artists have targetted customers of online banks when users went to certain search sites this allowed a pop-up ad to run underneath their main browser window , and set off a flurry of pop-up ads as well as installing programs onto it .
" if i sent you an e-mail with a link to a website in it , and you click on the link , i could have used the exploit that qhost used to install anything on your computer , " said mr cooper .
" depending on what e-mail program you were using , i may have been able to do that without you even clicking on the link . "
for mr cooper qhost marks a significant shift from viruses that cause system failures and inconvenience .
" in this case , they were trying to make money off you through ads , which is not what viruses normally do . "
graham cluley , sophos security analyst , thinks although these kinds of attacks are a threat they can be defended against by making sure your copy of internet explorer is updated .
" anti-spam companies are also increasingly treating html e-mails as suspicious " he said , " and legitimate e-mail marketers are beginning to see the backlash and are working against html . "
but even though browser flaws are fixable with downloadable patches , virus writers were constantly finding different methods to attack , making the patching job harder , said mr cooper .
big fakes other maliciously formed html attacks have targeted customers of online banks .
in these scams , e-mails are sent to customers asking them to go to the bank 's website to verify passwords and other confidential information .
the e-mails were fake and the website was a replica , but customers would not know that unless they actually examined the code behind the plausible looking message and webpage .
" this is going to occur more frequently , " warns mr cooper .
" as more people have accounts online , there are more opportunities for someone to pretend to be an entity and collect information from you , " says mr cooper .
but those behind the scams do not know what online bank customers use , said mr cluley , who advises people to ignore e-mails that purport to be from them and phone your bank instead .
by adding your online bank to your browser favourites ensure you are always going to the legitimate website .
" but we get so many html e-mails from people we know and do want , that to say ' if it 's html based then i am going to delete ' it is not realistic , " says mr cooper .
" microsoft continue running around chasing their tails in the hope that they can keep html e-mail secure enough , but we think that is going to be harder to do in the future . "

because the malicious code is not in an attachment , there is very little the average computer user can do unless they have the latest e-mail programs which block scripts or they examine e-mail coding .
mr cooper said html viruses , such as qhost , were becoming more common .
qhost used a loophole in microsoft 's browser that granted them the ability to plant their own code on a victim 's computer .
con artists have targetted customers of online banks when users went to certain search sites this allowed a pop-up ad to run underneath their main browser window , and set off a flurry of pop-up ads as well as installing programs onto it .

for mr cooper qhost marks a significant shift from viruses that cause system failures and inconvenience .

but , while no-one would want to minimise the horror of this tragic event , does it warrant a rush to action ?
there are a number of reasons for caution .
first , incidents like this are mercifully rare .
of course , almost the first response of journalists , myself included , is to remind everyone of previous fatalities in schools .
yet a closer look at these incidents reveals that fatal attacks by one pupil on another are exceptional , particularly if they occur inside school buildings .
most fatalities have involved intruders , usually with no connection to the school .
for example , it was an intruder who killed a teacher and 16 children at dunblane primary school in 1996 .
as the weekly american newspaper ' education week ' put it : ' are schools safer when teachers pack heat ? '
the fatal stabbing of london head teacher , philip lawrence , in 1995 and of a pupil at hall garth school , middlesbrough in 1994 also involved intruders .
the second reason for caution is that much has been done to improve school security since these attacks happened .
most schools now have better fences , more secure entrances , security cameras and intruder alarms .
there have also been changes in the law making it a criminal offence to carry knives or other offensive weapons on school premises and giving the police powers to search for knives inside schools .
the guidelines on disciplining pupils caught with offensive weapons have also been strengthened .
it is now easier to expel a pupil for a first offence and appeals panels can not reinstate pupils who have been found in possession of weapons .
metal detectors so is there really any need to do more ?
and if so , what could be done which would make schools safer ?
not surprisingly , some commentators have looked to the united states of america where some schools have installed metal detectors to screen pupils and visitors .
in chicago , they are now spending a million dollars a week on security which includes metal-detectors , x-ray machines and security staff .
the chicago public high schools now have a minimum of two uniformed police officers and two full-time security officers on duty during school hours .
guns , not knives , are the problem in the us this heightened security has been in place since september following an audit of school safety .
at the time , the chicago public schools ' boss , arne duncan , said " that 's the price we 're paying for our society 's appalling fascination with , and easy access to , guns . "
yet even in chicago , where the general murder rate is high , killings inside school are very rare .
moreover critics of extreme security in schools point out that metal-detectors would not have prevented outrages like the columbine high school killings in 1999 where pupils made no effort to conceal their weapons .
for the usa as a whole , statistics do not show any increase in acts of school violence .
for 2001-2 there were five school-associated deaths , down from 22 the previous year and well down from the high of 56 a decade ago .
statistics on violent deaths in schools in england are not collected by government .
as a department for education spokeswoman put it : " we do n't collect them because they are so rare . "
they would almost certainly be much lower than in the usa even after allowing for the differences in the size of the school population .
fortresses it is guns , rather than knives , which are the real problem in the usa .
just one indication of the differences between the two countries is the bizarre -lrb- to british eyes , at least -rrb- fact that in utah it is perfectly legal for an adult to carry a concealed gun providing they hold a permit for it .
as the weekly american newspaper education week put it in a recent article : " are schools safer when teachers pack heat ? "
so , in the light of all this , one has to wonder how appropriate it would be for schools here to adopt some of the american innovations , such as metal-detectors .
of course , particularly after dunblane , there can be no complacency .
but unless future events show this week 's tragedy to be part of a growing pattern , there seems little case for rushing to action .
it is perhaps worth recalling the comments of lord cullen after his inquiry into the dunblane tragedy .
he said that while schools should be as safe as possible a balance had to be struck and " it would be unacceptable to carry measures to the point where schools were turned into fortresses " .

2 of 7 thousands of supporters of mr wickramasinghe 's united national party turn out on the streets of the capital to welcome him back .
3 of 7 they are countered by supporters of president chandrika kumaratunga , who on friday lifted the state of emergency in favour of less draconian measures .
4 of 7 the pro-kumaratunga rally drew an estimated 30,000 people , marching under the banner of the newly formed patriotic national movement .
5 of 7 the opponents of the prime minister fear the concessions given to the tamil tigers will lead to a federal sri lanka .
6 of 7 mr wickramasinghe says the parliament suspended by mrs kumaratunga must be reconvened immediately to restart the peace process .

the scottish national party 's stewart maxwell hopes to publish his anti-smoking bill at holyrood in the new year .
his proposals would ban people from lighting up in places where food is served , such as restaurants , bars and cafes .
now macmillan cancer relief has written to every member of the scottish parliament urging them to support the move .
the letter from scottish director ian gibson is part of the charity 's lung cancer awareness campaign .
" the high rates of lung cancer in scotland reflect principally our history of high smoking prevalence , " he wrote .
medical community " reducing exposure to tobacco smoke is the simplest and most effective way of reducing our lung cancer rates .
" we urge you to support stewart maxwell 's proposed bill to restrict smoking in public places , both to lower the risk of passive smoking and to encourage people to give up . "
mr maxwell said : " it is always heartening to receive support from the medical community on this much needed measure to safeguard the health of the scottish public .
" i am very pleased that an organisation which specialises in cancer care , and which is held in such high esteem by the scottish public has given my proposed bill such complete support . "
" you must take public opinion with you otherwise it just wo n't work " stewart maxwell msp consultation on the issue of smoking in bars and restaurants was carried out during the summer .
mr maxwell said he had received support from cancer charities and the british medical association .
he also received hundreds of emails of support from the public .
the only dissent came from tobacco manufacturers and organisations like forest , which campaigns to defend the interests of smokers .
msps from across the political spectrum have also shown support for the proposals , said mr maxwell .
he admitted that he - and a number of other organisations - would like to see a complete ban on smoking in public places .
survey evidence but he said there were a number of reasons why he had limited the scope of his proposals .
" you must take public opinion with you otherwise it just wo n't work , it wo n't be effective , " he said .
" the survey evidence is that people support a ban where there is food involved in restaurants and cafes .
that is fairly clear now .
" once we get that on the statute book i think public opinion will move on from there . "
he also acknowledged that it was " debatable " whether a complete ban would win support at holyrood .

he added that statistics show the majority drive high-powered machines and are likely to die on a sunday afternoon when the weather is sunny .

" it is not just a serious problem in north wales and the dyfed-powys area has had a significant increase . "
the number of motorbike deaths in north wales last year was seven and the figure was ten in 2001 .

" in the course of doing so , they have alarmed and whipped up public opinion in hartlepool and many fears amongst my constituents , and i think that is an irresponsible thing to do . "
he went on : " friends of the earth refer to these constantly as toxic ships .

" like all ships , they contain some hazardous materials , but they are not inherently dangerous and they are not carrying any toxic cargo . "

craig murray , 44 , returned to the uk two months ago on sick leave .
opposition mep john bowis says mr murray is now well .
the foreign office says it is awaiting medical clearance .
campaigners say mr murray was urged to resign after annoying his host and its strategic ally , the us , by criticising human rights abuses in uzbekistan .
land rover mr bowis , a member of the conservative party , said he has raised mr murray 's case at the european parliament and asked the european commission to challenge the foreign office on the reasons behind his extended absence .
friends have said mr murray needed medical treatment because he was suffering depression after being threatened by the foreign office over alleged misconduct .
accusations against him reportedly included allowing an embassy land rover to be driven down some steps , drinking into the early hours with contacts and backing the visa application of the daughter of an uzbek family friend .
a charge d 'affaires has been sent to the former soviet republic until the scot is well enough to return to work .
but the foreign office has said it shares mr murray 's concerns about human rights in the former soviet state , and insisted that he remains the ambassador .
both the us and uzbekistan deny any involvement in the affair .
us aid following the 11 september attacks on the us , uzbek president islam karimov won favour with washington by allowing its forces a base in uzbekistan , affording ready access across the afghan border .
us aid to the central asian country has since increased .
in a speech last november in tashkent , just months after taking up his post , mr murray launched a strong attack on the uzbek government .
he said up to 10,000 political or religious prisoners were being detained .
mr murray , one of britain 's youngest ambassadors , compared the regime of long-time president mr karimov with saddam hussein 's iraq .
his comments were included in the foreign office 's annual report on human rights , published in september .
