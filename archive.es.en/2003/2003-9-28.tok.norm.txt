by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .
hospitals were able to continue operating thanks to emergency generators .
other than in a few isolated pockets , power went out across the entire country , virtually at the same time in a blackout that lasted nearly five hours and affected most of italy ’ s 57 million residents .
as many as 30,000 people were stranded as electricity powered trains ground to a halt .
in southern tyrol , one train even had to be pulled out of an alpine tunnel , and outages stopped train traffic between the heavily trafficked border sectors to switzerland .
failed power lines by sunday afternoon , however , power was gradually being restored across the country .
italian officials blamed the brownout on the breakdown of electricity lines coming in from france , switzerland and austria – all countries from which energy-hungry italy imports power .
one line coming in from switzerland appeared to be knocked out after a tree fell on it , but officials said it was unlikely a single event could trigger the failure of italy ’ s entire power grid .
the incident highlights italy 's limited capacity for generating its own power . as energy officials sought to find answers explaining italy 's worst blackout in a decade , police and other civic authorities sought to bring the country back under control .
by mid-morning , they succeeded in doing so , according to guido bertolas , the head of italy ’ s civil protection services .
the cuts hit the italian mainland and the island of sicily .
there was , however , no disruption of supplies on the island of sardinia .
the latest in a chain of events sunday 's blackout marks the latest in a series of major power cuts to hit europe .
italy itself had some partial outages in june .
on august 28 , power failed in london , creating disasterous traffic and transportation chaos in the british capital .
and on sept .
23 , the power grid failed in denmark and sweden following problems with electricity supply from a swedish nuclear power plant .
analysts say the incident in italy is likely to revive debate over whether italy should turn to nuclear power to help generate its energy needs .
the authorities say power demand is growing faster than supply and even imported electricity is unlikely to be enough in the long-term . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de complete blackout unlikely in germany crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 business -pipe- 28.09.2003 the dark cloud over oktoberfest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's favorite oktoberfest beers now belong to a belgian multinational .
shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner . germans love beer – and each german seems like a different kind .
in fact , there are 1,200 breweries spread out across the country , and nearly half are based in the southern german state of bavaria .
but even germany ’ s biggest beer brands are midgets compared to their international competitors .
and nowadays , the world ’ s greatest beer companies are on a shopping spree to snap up germany ’ s most reliably profitable beers .
anheuser busch , sab miller , heineken and interbrew are among the most competitive bidders – and depending on a the view of a specific german companies , name dropping those global players will either lead to fear or joy .
belgians now dominate german beer market in mid-september , the belgian interbrew group announced it would acquire the majority shares in wheat beer brewer spaten-franziskaner , making the combined company the largest brewer in germany .
the buyout served as a tough pill to swallow for many germans – after all , for 600 years , the munich company , which made spaten , franziskaner and löwenbräu beers , remained independent .
but in times of decreasing beer sales – be it from health worries , increasingly popular wine or trendy alcoholic mixed drinks – german breweries are losing financial steam and many increasingly see the global players as saviors rather than predators .
" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .

and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .
though putin ’ s remarks appeared to come as a slight setback to bush , who has so far failed to line up much by means of troop support or financial aid for stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , the u.s. president offered a positive spin .
" i recognize that some countries are inhibited from participation because of the lack of a u.n. resolution .
we are working to get a satisfactory resolution out of the united nations .
we spent some time talking about that today . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and putin to put relations back on track in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2003 italy recovers from worst blackout in a decade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darkness in rome most of italy lost power sunday morning in the latest european blackout , leaving thousands stranded and city streets dark .
by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .
though putin ’ s remarks appeared to come as a slight setback to bush , who has so far failed to line up much by means of troop support or financial aid for stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , the u.s. president offered a positive spin .
" i recognize that some countries are inhibited from participation because of the lack of a u.n. resolution .
we are working to get a satisfactory resolution out of the united nations .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 business -pipe- 28.09.2003 the dark cloud over oktoberfest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's favorite oktoberfest beers now belong to a belgian multinational .
shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner . germans love beer – and each german seems like a different kind .
in fact , there are 1,200 breweries spread out across the country , and nearly half are based in the southern german state of bavaria .
but even germany ’ s biggest beer brands are midgets compared to their international competitors .
and nowadays , the world ’ s greatest beer companies are on a shopping spree to snap up germany ’ s most reliably profitable beers .
anheuser busch , sab miller , heineken and interbrew are among the most competitive bidders – and depending on a the view of a specific german companies , name dropping those global players will either lead to fear or joy .
belgians now dominate german beer market in mid-september , the belgian interbrew group announced it would acquire the majority shares in wheat beer brewer spaten-franziskaner , making the combined company the largest brewer in germany .
the buyout served as a tough pill to swallow for many germans – after all , for 600 years , the munich company , which made spaten , franziskaner and löwenbräu beers , remained independent .
but in times of decreasing beer sales – be it from health worries , increasingly popular wine or trendy alcoholic mixed drinks – german breweries are losing financial steam and many increasingly see the global players as saviors rather than predators .
" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .
two large german conglomerates want to buy them .
and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 business -pipe- 28.09.2003 the dark cloud over oktoberfest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's favorite oktoberfest beers now belong to a belgian multinational .
shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner . germans love beer – and each german seems like a different kind .
in fact , there are 1,200 breweries spread out across the country , and nearly half are based in the southern german state of bavaria .
but even germany ’ s biggest beer brands are midgets compared to their international competitors .
and nowadays , the world ’ s greatest beer companies are on a shopping spree to snap up germany ’ s most reliably profitable beers .
anheuser busch , sab miller , heineken and interbrew are among the most competitive bidders – and depending on a the view of a specific german companies , name dropping those global players will either lead to fear or joy .
belgians now dominate german beer market in mid-september , the belgian interbrew group announced it would acquire the majority shares in wheat beer brewer spaten-franziskaner , making the combined company the largest brewer in germany .
the buyout served as a tough pill to swallow for many germans – after all , for 600 years , the munich company , which made spaten , franziskaner and löwenbräu beers , remained independent .
but in times of decreasing beer sales – be it from health worries , increasingly popular wine or trendy alcoholic mixed drinks – german breweries are losing financial steam and many increasingly see the global players as saviors rather than predators .
" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .
two large german conglomerates want to buy them .
and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .
and , of course , with the powerful distribution channels of companies like interbrew or heineken - beer lovers in far off destinations , like , say , the united states , could get access to premium brands previously the stuff of oktoberfest myth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's interbrew acquires munich 's spaten beer the world ’ s third largest brewery , the interbrew group has bought up a piece of southern german brewing history .

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .
hospitals were able to continue operating thanks to emergency generators .
other than in a few isolated pockets , power went out across the entire country , virtually at the same time in a blackout that lasted nearly five hours and affected most of italy ’ s 57 million residents .
as many as 30,000 people were stranded as electricity powered trains ground to a halt .
in southern tyrol , one train even had to be pulled out of an alpine tunnel , and outages stopped train traffic between the heavily trafficked border sectors to switzerland .
failed power lines by sunday afternoon , however , power was gradually being restored across the country .
italian officials blamed the brownout on the breakdown of electricity lines coming in from france , switzerland and austria – all countries from which energy-hungry italy imports power .
one line coming in from switzerland appeared to be knocked out after a tree fell on it , but officials said it was unlikely a single event could trigger the failure of italy ’ s entire power grid .
the incident highlights italy 's limited capacity for generating its own power . as energy officials sought to find answers explaining italy 's worst blackout in a decade , police and other civic authorities sought to bring the country back under control .

23 , the power grid failed in denmark and sweden following problems with electricity supply from a swedish nuclear power plant .

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .
hospitals were able to continue operating thanks to emergency generators .
other than in a few isolated pockets , power went out across the entire country , virtually at the same time in a blackout that lasted nearly five hours and affected most of italy ’ s 57 million residents .
as many as 30,000 people were stranded as electricity powered trains ground to a halt .
in southern tyrol , one train even had to be pulled out of an alpine tunnel , and outages stopped train traffic between the heavily trafficked border sectors to switzerland .
failed power lines by sunday afternoon , however , power was gradually being restored across the country .
italian officials blamed the brownout on the breakdown of electricity lines coming in from france , switzerland and austria – all countries from which energy-hungry italy imports power .
one line coming in from switzerland appeared to be knocked out after a tree fell on it , but officials said it was unlikely a single event could trigger the failure of italy ’ s entire power grid .
the incident highlights italy 's limited capacity for generating its own power . as energy officials sought to find answers explaining italy 's worst blackout in a decade , police and other civic authorities sought to bring the country back under control .
by mid-morning , they succeeded in doing so , according to guido bertolas , the head of italy ’ s civil protection services .
the cuts hit the italian mainland and the island of sicily .
there was , however , no disruption of supplies on the island of sardinia .
the latest in a chain of events sunday 's blackout marks the latest in a series of major power cuts to hit europe .
italy itself had some partial outages in june .
on august 28 , power failed in london , creating disasterous traffic and transportation chaos in the british capital .
and on sept .
23 , the power grid failed in denmark and sweden following problems with electricity supply from a swedish nuclear power plant .
analysts say the incident in italy is likely to revive debate over whether italy should turn to nuclear power to help generate its energy needs .
the authorities say power demand is growing faster than supply and even imported electricity is unlikely to be enough in the long-term . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de complete blackout unlikely in germany crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 business -pipe- 28.09.2003 the dark cloud over oktoberfest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's favorite oktoberfest beers now belong to a belgian multinational .
shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner . germans love beer – and each german seems like a different kind .
in fact , there are 1,200 breweries spread out across the country , and nearly half are based in the southern german state of bavaria .
but even germany ’ s biggest beer brands are midgets compared to their international competitors .
and nowadays , the world ’ s greatest beer companies are on a shopping spree to snap up germany ’ s most reliably profitable beers .
anheuser busch , sab miller , heineken and interbrew are among the most competitive bidders – and depending on a the view of a specific german companies , name dropping those global players will either lead to fear or joy .
belgians now dominate german beer market in mid-september , the belgian interbrew group announced it would acquire the majority shares in wheat beer brewer spaten-franziskaner , making the combined company the largest brewer in germany .
the buyout served as a tough pill to swallow for many germans – after all , for 600 years , the munich company , which made spaten , franziskaner and löwenbräu beers , remained independent .
but in times of decreasing beer sales – be it from health worries , increasingly popular wine or trendy alcoholic mixed drinks – german breweries are losing financial steam and many increasingly see the global players as saviors rather than predators .
" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .
two large german conglomerates want to buy them .
and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .
and , of course , with the powerful distribution channels of companies like interbrew or heineken - beer lovers in far off destinations , like , say , the united states , could get access to premium brands previously the stuff of oktoberfest myth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's interbrew acquires munich 's spaten beer the world ’ s third largest brewery , the interbrew group has bought up a piece of southern german brewing history .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .
hospitals were able to continue operating thanks to emergency generators .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .
though putin ’ s remarks appeared to come as a slight setback to bush , who has so far failed to line up much by means of troop support or financial aid for stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , the u.s. president offered a positive spin .
" i recognize that some countries are inhibited from participation because of the lack of a u.n. resolution .
we are working to get a satisfactory resolution out of the united nations .
we spent some time talking about that today . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and putin to put relations back on track in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .
at camp david this weekend , bush and putin will seek to put their differences behind them .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 business -pipe- 28.09.2003 the dark cloud over oktoberfest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's favorite oktoberfest beers now belong to a belgian multinational .
shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner . germans love beer – and each german seems like a different kind .
in fact , there are 1,200 breweries spread out across the country , and nearly half are based in the southern german state of bavaria .
but even germany ’ s biggest beer brands are midgets compared to their international competitors .
and nowadays , the world ’ s greatest beer companies are on a shopping spree to snap up germany ’ s most reliably profitable beers .
anheuser busch , sab miller , heineken and interbrew are among the most competitive bidders – and depending on a the view of a specific german companies , name dropping those global players will either lead to fear or joy .
belgians now dominate german beer market in mid-september , the belgian interbrew group announced it would acquire the majority shares in wheat beer brewer spaten-franziskaner , making the combined company the largest brewer in germany .
the buyout served as a tough pill to swallow for many germans – after all , for 600 years , the munich company , which made spaten , franziskaner and löwenbräu beers , remained independent .
but in times of decreasing beer sales – be it from health worries , increasingly popular wine or trendy alcoholic mixed drinks – german breweries are losing financial steam and many increasingly see the global players as saviors rather than predators .
" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .
two large german conglomerates want to buy them .
and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .
and , of course , with the powerful distribution channels of companies like interbrew or heineken - beer lovers in far off destinations , like , say , the united states , could get access to premium brands previously the stuff of oktoberfest myth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's interbrew acquires munich 's spaten beer the world ’ s third largest brewery , the interbrew group has bought up a piece of southern german brewing history .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 business -pipe- 28.09.2003 the dark cloud over oktoberfest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's favorite oktoberfest beers now belong to a belgian multinational .
shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner . germans love beer – and each german seems like a different kind .
in fact , there are 1,200 breweries spread out across the country , and nearly half are based in the southern german state of bavaria .
but even germany ’ s biggest beer brands are midgets compared to their international competitors .
and nowadays , the world ’ s greatest beer companies are on a shopping spree to snap up germany ’ s most reliably profitable beers .
anheuser busch , sab miller , heineken and interbrew are among the most competitive bidders – and depending on a the view of a specific german companies , name dropping those global players will either lead to fear or joy .
belgians now dominate german beer market in mid-september , the belgian interbrew group announced it would acquire the majority shares in wheat beer brewer spaten-franziskaner , making the combined company the largest brewer in germany .
the buyout served as a tough pill to swallow for many germans – after all , for 600 years , the munich company , which made spaten , franziskaner and löwenbräu beers , remained independent .
but in times of decreasing beer sales – be it from health worries , increasingly popular wine or trendy alcoholic mixed drinks – german breweries are losing financial steam and many increasingly see the global players as saviors rather than predators .
" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .
two large german conglomerates want to buy them .
and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .
and , of course , with the powerful distribution channels of companies like interbrew or heineken - beer lovers in far off destinations , like , say , the united states , could get access to premium brands previously the stuff of oktoberfest myth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's interbrew acquires munich 's spaten beer the world ’ s third largest brewery , the interbrew group has bought up a piece of southern german brewing history .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .
though putin ’ s remarks appeared to come as a slight setback to bush , who has so far failed to line up much by means of troop support or financial aid for stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , the u.s. president offered a positive spin .
" i recognize that some countries are inhibited from participation because of the lack of a u.n. resolution .
we are working to get a satisfactory resolution out of the united nations .
we spent some time talking about that today . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and putin to put relations back on track in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2003 italy recovers from worst blackout in a decade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darkness in rome most of italy lost power sunday morning in the latest european blackout , leaving thousands stranded and city streets dark .
by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .
hospitals were able to continue operating thanks to emergency generators .
other than in a few isolated pockets , power went out across the entire country , virtually at the same time in a blackout that lasted nearly five hours and affected most of italy ’ s 57 million residents .
as many as 30,000 people were stranded as electricity powered trains ground to a halt .
in southern tyrol , one train even had to be pulled out of an alpine tunnel , and outages stopped train traffic between the heavily trafficked border sectors to switzerland .
failed power lines by sunday afternoon , however , power was gradually being restored across the country .
italian officials blamed the brownout on the breakdown of electricity lines coming in from france , switzerland and austria – all countries from which energy-hungry italy imports power .
one line coming in from switzerland appeared to be knocked out after a tree fell on it , but officials said it was unlikely a single event could trigger the failure of italy ’ s entire power grid .
the incident highlights italy 's limited capacity for generating its own power . as energy officials sought to find answers explaining italy 's worst blackout in a decade , police and other civic authorities sought to bring the country back under control .
by mid-morning , they succeeded in doing so , according to guido bertolas , the head of italy ’ s civil protection services .
the cuts hit the italian mainland and the island of sicily .
there was , however , no disruption of supplies on the island of sardinia .
the latest in a chain of events sunday 's blackout marks the latest in a series of major power cuts to hit europe .
italy itself had some partial outages in june .
on august 28 , power failed in london , creating disasterous traffic and transportation chaos in the british capital .
and on sept .
23 , the power grid failed in denmark and sweden following problems with electricity supply from a swedish nuclear power plant .
analysts say the incident in italy is likely to revive debate over whether italy should turn to nuclear power to help generate its energy needs .
the authorities say power demand is growing faster than supply and even imported electricity is unlikely to be enough in the long-term . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de complete blackout unlikely in germany crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function .

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .
hospitals were able to continue operating thanks to emergency generators .
other than in a few isolated pockets , power went out across the entire country , virtually at the same time in a blackout that lasted nearly five hours and affected most of italy ’ s 57 million residents .
as many as 30,000 people were stranded as electricity powered trains ground to a halt .
in southern tyrol , one train even had to be pulled out of an alpine tunnel , and outages stopped train traffic between the heavily trafficked border sectors to switzerland .
failed power lines by sunday afternoon , however , power was gradually being restored across the country .
italian officials blamed the brownout on the breakdown of electricity lines coming in from france , switzerland and austria – all countries from which energy-hungry italy imports power .
one line coming in from switzerland appeared to be knocked out after a tree fell on it , but officials said it was unlikely a single event could trigger the failure of italy ’ s entire power grid .
the incident highlights italy 's limited capacity for generating its own power . as energy officials sought to find answers explaining italy 's worst blackout in a decade , police and other civic authorities sought to bring the country back under control .
by mid-morning , they succeeded in doing so , according to guido bertolas , the head of italy ’ s civil protection services .
the cuts hit the italian mainland and the island of sicily .
there was , however , no disruption of supplies on the island of sardinia .
the latest in a chain of events sunday 's blackout marks the latest in a series of major power cuts to hit europe .
italy itself had some partial outages in june .
on august 28 , power failed in london , creating disasterous traffic and transportation chaos in the british capital .
and on sept .
23 , the power grid failed in denmark and sweden following problems with electricity supply from a swedish nuclear power plant .
analysts say the incident in italy is likely to revive debate over whether italy should turn to nuclear power to help generate its energy needs .
the authorities say power demand is growing faster than supply and even imported electricity is unlikely to be enough in the long-term . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de complete blackout unlikely in germany crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function .

the revelry begins at oktoberfest 2002 business -pipe- 28.09.2003 the dark cloud over oktoberfest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of germany 's favorite oktoberfest beers now belong to a belgian multinational .
shortly before oktoberfest kicked off in munich this month , the begium-based brewing multinational interbrew acquired two of the annual festival ’ s most famous brews : spaten and franziskaner . germans love beer – and each german seems like a different kind .
in fact , there are 1,200 breweries spread out across the country , and nearly half are based in the southern german state of bavaria .
but even germany ’ s biggest beer brands are midgets compared to their international competitors .
and nowadays , the world ’ s greatest beer companies are on a shopping spree to snap up germany ’ s most reliably profitable beers .
anheuser busch , sab miller , heineken and interbrew are among the most competitive bidders – and depending on a the view of a specific german companies , name dropping those global players will either lead to fear or joy .
belgians now dominate german beer market in mid-september , the belgian interbrew group announced it would acquire the majority shares in wheat beer brewer spaten-franziskaner , making the combined company the largest brewer in germany .
the buyout served as a tough pill to swallow for many germans – after all , for 600 years , the munich company , which made spaten , franziskaner and löwenbräu beers , remained independent .
but in times of decreasing beer sales – be it from health worries , increasingly popular wine or trendy alcoholic mixed drinks – german breweries are losing financial steam and many increasingly see the global players as saviors rather than predators .
" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .
two large german conglomerates want to buy them .
and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .
though putin ’ s remarks appeared to come as a slight setback to bush , who has so far failed to line up much by means of troop support or financial aid for stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , the u.s. president offered a positive spin .
" i recognize that some countries are inhibited from participation because of the lack of a u.n. resolution .
we are working to get a satisfactory resolution out of the united nations .
we spent some time talking about that today . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and putin to put relations back on track in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .
hospitals were able to continue operating thanks to emergency generators .
other than in a few isolated pockets , power went out across the entire country , virtually at the same time in a blackout that lasted nearly five hours and affected most of italy ’ s 57 million residents .
as many as 30,000 people were stranded as electricity powered trains ground to a halt .
in southern tyrol , one train even had to be pulled out of an alpine tunnel , and outages stopped train traffic between the heavily trafficked border sectors to switzerland .
failed power lines by sunday afternoon , however , power was gradually being restored across the country .
italian officials blamed the brownout on the breakdown of electricity lines coming in from france , switzerland and austria – all countries from which energy-hungry italy imports power .
one line coming in from switzerland appeared to be knocked out after a tree fell on it , but officials said it was unlikely a single event could trigger the failure of italy ’ s entire power grid .
the incident highlights italy 's limited capacity for generating its own power . as energy officials sought to find answers explaining italy 's worst blackout in a decade , police and other civic authorities sought to bring the country back under control .
by mid-morning , they succeeded in doing so , according to guido bertolas , the head of italy ’ s civil protection services .
the cuts hit the italian mainland and the island of sicily .
there was , however , no disruption of supplies on the island of sardinia .
the latest in a chain of events sunday 's blackout marks the latest in a series of major power cuts to hit europe .
italy itself had some partial outages in june .
on august 28 , power failed in london , creating disasterous traffic and transportation chaos in the british capital .
and on sept .
23 , the power grid failed in denmark and sweden following problems with electricity supply from a swedish nuclear power plant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.09.2003 u.s. , russia pressure iran on nukes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin -lrb- left -rrb- and bush are on friendlier terms , but they are still divided on many issues .
calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .
though putin ’ s remarks appeared to come as a slight setback to bush , who has so far failed to line up much by means of troop support or financial aid for stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , the u.s. president offered a positive spin .
" i recognize that some countries are inhibited from participation because of the lack of a u.n. resolution .
we are working to get a satisfactory resolution out of the united nations .
we spent some time talking about that today . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and putin to put relations back on track in the wake of the u.s.-led war against iraq , relations that in recent years seemed warm and fuzzy took a decidedly colder turn .

but in times of decreasing beer sales – be it from health worries , increasingly popular wine or trendy alcoholic mixed drinks – german breweries are losing financial steam and many increasingly see the global players as saviors rather than predators .
" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .
two large german conglomerates want to buy them .
and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .

" a partner would be a huge boost for our export opportunities , " jobst kayser-eichberg , ceo of spaten-löwenbräu , told deutsche welle . " the brands we have , such as franziskaner and löwenbräu , have tremendous international potential , but we need capital .
but germany has a particular problem in this respect because the german market is too competitive .
you ca n't describe it as a lucrative market . "
brands , brands and more brands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's brewery interbrew first entered the german market two years ago when it acquired diebels , a popular brewery in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
afterwards it swallowed up becks and gilde , which owns the hasseröderer label .
taken together with spaten , the acquisitions will now give interbrew an 11 percent share of the german beer market , with annual production volume of 15.6 million hectoliters of beer .
but buyouts don ’ t come cheap , and interbrew ’ s been throwing around considerable sums as it shops up germany ’ s most beloved traditional brands .
for becks , the company had to fork out € 1.8 billion . it spent another € 477 million to bring spaten under its fold .
by comparison , germany ’ s largest brewer , holsten , has a market capitalization of € 650 million .
as part of its deal to acquire spaten , interbrew also gets the majority shares in the baden-württemburg-based schwabenbräu-dinkelacker , which it will now put under the care of interbrew subsidiary becks .
many believe the spaten buy will spur further sales of german breweries to foreign companies .
the next target is likely to be the dortmund-based brau and brunnen , which ranks high on the list of interesting properties for the multinationals .
but interbrew executives say they aren ’ t interested in the company it is focus on already profitable brands that will continue to make money in a shrinking beer market .
that also fits in with interbrew ’ s global strategy of snatching up strong brands in a number of countries .
and the company is doing so in many markets .
after all , western europe only accounts for one-third of its revenues .
the rest come from eastern europe and the united states , where it owns brands including rolling rock and labatt ’ s .
generally speaking , in order to become a global player in beer these days , a company needs to produce on the order of 50 million hectoliters per year .
by comparison , holsten , as germany ’ s largest brewer , produces only 11 million hectoliters annually .
and more than half of all german breweries produce less than 5,000 hectoliters per year .
acquisitions as a model ?
under current market conditions , only the strongest have much chance of surviving , and brewmasters must now consider whether they should remain independent despite over-capacities and disappearing revenues .
many are deciding against the avenue . " it 's going to get even tougher , because the process of concentration is just beginning , " said spaten-löwenbräu 's kayser-eichberg . " you see it with the holsten and brau and brunnen companies .
two large german conglomerates want to buy them .
and my idea was , i 'd prefer to dictate the terms myself rather than be steamrollered later when prices are low . "
cooperative agreements are another alternative that will spare famous german brands from falling into foreign hands .
but there are some winners these days .
with all of the talk of a possible acquisition , holsten has seen its share price rise from € 20 to € 50 per share in 2003 .
and , of course , with the powerful distribution channels of companies like interbrew or heineken - beer lovers in far off destinations , like , say , the united states , could get access to premium brands previously the stuff of oktoberfest myth . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium 's interbrew acquires munich 's spaten beer the world ’ s third largest brewery , the interbrew group has bought up a piece of southern german brewing history .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .
though putin ’ s remarks appeared to come as a slight setback to bush , who has so far failed to line up much by means of troop support or financial aid for stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , the u.s. president offered a positive spin .
" i recognize that some countries are inhibited from participation because of the lack of a u.n. resolution .

calls for iran to end its nuclear ambitions dominated talks between george w. bush and vladimir putin on saturday .
both called on iran to cooperate with international controls , but differences still remained over iraq . saying that russia has " no desire and no plans to contribute in any way to the creation of weapons of mass destruction , either in iran or any other spot or region in the world , " putin called on the iranians to cooperate closely with the iaea , which has given the country until the end of october to provide evidence that its nuclear program is based on purely civilian intentions .
he said tehran should be sent a " clear but respectful sign " to cooperate .
russia has come under fire from washington in recent weeks because it is helping iran to construct a nuclear plant that some fear could be used to create weapons grade uranium .
the united states has asked russia not to provide the fuel that would be used to operate the plant when it goes online in 2005 .
the country has earned millions for the transfer of nuclear technology to the middle eastern country .
common goals washington and moscow , bush said , " share a common goal , and that is to make sure iran doesn ’ t have a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program .
we also understand that we need to work together to convince iran to abandon any ambition she may have " to build a nuclear weapon , he said .
nuclear concerns about iran and north korea played a dominant role during putin ’ s two-day visit to camp david , a presidential retreat north of washington , d.c. , in maryland .
in his talks , putin warned that heightened tensions with north korea , which along with iran has been described by bush as part of the " axis of evil , " in order for constructive talks to take place .
" russia believes that ensuring nuclear nonproliferation should be accompanied by extending to north korea guarantees in the security sphere , " he said .
" we intend to continue our joint work with the united states in resolving this issue . "
differences over iraq however , bush and putin failed to find agreement on the sensitive issue of iraq , which drove a wedge during the past year between washington and moscow policymakers .
the extent of the division that remained after saturday ’ s meeting shows how far the two leaders have strayed since bush ’ s famous meeting with putin in june 2001 .
afterwards , bush said he had peered into putin ’ s soul and liked what he ’ d seen .
but those ties were strained severely this year when moscow took every possible step to hinder a war aimed at toppling saddam hussein ’ s regime .
but both seemed intent on burying the hatchet at saturday ’ s meeting .
" vladimir and i had very frank discussions about iraq , " bush said .
" i understood his position .
he understood mine , but because we ’ ve got a trustworthy relationship , we ’ re able to move beyond any disagreement over a single issue . "
unfortunately , iraq seemed to be one of the areas where they couldn ’ t move forward .
putin said moscow could only make decisions on how it would aid in providing security and reconstruction aid to iraq after a new resolution is passed at the united nations .
he said russia wanted to see the normalization of iraq " as soon as possible . "
" at the same time , " he said , " we understand it is a complicated process that should be based on a solid legal and administrative basis and should go ahead stage by stage . "
any russian participation , putin said , would be contingent on the scope and nature of a new u.n. resolution .
though putin ’ s remarks appeared to come as a slight setback to bush , who has so far failed to line up much by means of troop support or financial aid for stabilizing and rebuilding iraq , the u.s. president offered a positive spin .
" i recognize that some countries are inhibited from participation because of the lack of a u.n. resolution .
we are working to get a satisfactory resolution out of the united nations .
we spent some time talking about that today .

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country . the italian capital - normally a sea of lights - plunged into darkness early sunday morning , as a five-hour blackout struck most of italy .
more than a million people were out celebrating rome 's first " white night " party , an all-night cultural extravaganza with museums and restaurants due to stay open till dawn .
the lights went out at around 3:30am , and the " white night " became virtually pitch black .
the city 's subway came to complete standstill , leaving hundreds of people stranded underground .
but most of them took the blackout in stride .
" we do n't know anything , power 's gone off across italy but we do n't know why or how long we 're going to have to sit here , " one reveler told deutsche welle .
those above ground were left to walk home or try their luck on one of the desperately overcrowded buses plying the city .
hospitals were able to continue operating thanks to emergency generators .
other than in a few isolated pockets , power went out across the entire country , virtually at the same time in a blackout that lasted nearly five hours and affected most of italy ’ s 57 million residents .
as many as 30,000 people were stranded as electricity powered trains ground to a halt .
in southern tyrol , one train even had to be pulled out of an alpine tunnel , and outages stopped train traffic between the heavily trafficked border sectors to switzerland .
failed power lines by sunday afternoon , however , power was gradually being restored across the country .
italian officials blamed the brownout on the breakdown of electricity lines coming in from france , switzerland and austria – all countries from which energy-hungry italy imports power .
one line coming in from switzerland appeared to be knocked out after a tree fell on it , but officials said it was unlikely a single event could trigger the failure of italy ’ s entire power grid .
the incident highlights italy 's limited capacity for generating its own power . as energy officials sought to find answers explaining italy 's worst blackout in a decade , police and other civic authorities sought to bring the country back under control .
by mid-morning , they succeeded in doing so , according to guido bertolas , the head of italy ’ s civil protection services .
the cuts hit the italian mainland and the island of sicily .
there was , however , no disruption of supplies on the island of sardinia .
the latest in a chain of events sunday 's blackout marks the latest in a series of major power cuts to hit europe .
italy itself had some partial outages in june .
on august 28 , power failed in london , creating disasterous traffic and transportation chaos in the british capital .
and on sept .
23 , the power grid failed in denmark and sweden following problems with electricity supply from a swedish nuclear power plant .
analysts say the incident in italy is likely to revive debate over whether italy should turn to nuclear power to help generate its energy needs .
the authorities say power demand is growing faster than supply and even imported electricity is unlikely to be enough in the long-term . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de complete blackout unlikely in germany crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function .

launch eyewitness : cosmic ballet in the tropical night watch the launch the smart 1 probe blasted off from the kourou spaceport in french guiana at 2314 gmt .
forty-two minutes later , ground controllers said the spacecraft had been released successfully from its ariane 5 rocket launcher and was on its correct course .
smart 1 will test a novel type of propulsion system on its journey to the moon and then map the lunar body 's surface features when it arrives in 2005 .
" just because the astronauts went to the moon does n't mean they found out everything there is to find out , " said professor david southwood , the head of science at the european space agency .
the unmanned smart 1 craft will look for water on the moon .
the probe will also gather precise data on its chemical make-up .
this information should confirm the theory that the moon was created in a collision between earth and another object not long after our solar system came into being .
two communications spacecraft were launched with smart 1 - an indian tv satellite , and a broadband internet platform for europe .
small things smart - short for small missions for advanced research and technology - is europe 's first attempt at a solo moon mission .
giant impact theory suggests mars-sized object crashed into early earth debris thrown into space aggregated into the moon supported by similar composition of earth and moon rocks it is a technology demonstrator and has been built in a short time and very cheaply .
the total bill has come to just 110 million euro -lrb- £ 76m -rrb- , including launch fees .
this has been achieved partly by using new management methods but also by using novel techniques of miniaturisation and design .
at only a metre square in size and weighing just 367 kilograms , it could almost be a space toy .
but smart is packed with kit that will change the nature of future high-budget missions from europe .
new thrust of major interest is the solar-electric propulsion system that will push smart towards the moon .
the engine works by expelling a beam of charged xenon atoms - ions - out of the back of the probe .
this produces a thrust in the opposite direction and pushes the spacecraft forward .
click here to see how smart 1 's ion drive engine works the experimental engine is scheduled to be switched on on tuesday .
the energy to feed the system comes from the solar panels , hence the term " solar-electric " .
ion drives accelerate slower than chemical rockets ion drives do not produce the sudden burst of forward momentum you get from a chemical rocket .
but over the long-term they are considerably more efficient and many future probes will use them .
scientists have been developing ion-drives for decades but it is only recently that they have been used in real space applications .
this is principally because new developments in photocell technology have greatly improved the effectiveness of spacecraft solar wings .
the 1998 us probe deep space 1 flew with an ion drive , and there is a european satellite , artemis , that maintains its orbit with one .
nevertheless , over short distances , ion drives are quite slow .
smart will take 15 months to reach its target .
wrong rocks " we will spiral out progressively ... up to the point where we will start to feel the attraction of the moon , " said dr bernard foing , smart 1 project scientist .
" further , we will have a spiral down , to be closer to the moon , and then we will reach the final science orbit , from where we can do all the observations that we want to take . "
and that is where some of the new miniaturised instruments will come into play .
one of them , d-cixs , a uk contribution to the project , developed at the rutherton appleton laboratory in oxfordshire , will make the most comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .
" we think we know what the moon is made of because the apollo astronauts went there and brought back half a tonne of rock samples .
" but they went to the earth side , on the equator and on the flat bits , " said professor manuel grande , on the instrument team .
" those areas are n't typical and , importantly , they 're not the ancient ones .
what we need to do is a global survey of what the moon is made of - and smart 1 with our x-ray spectrometer will do that . "
next step this information will help scientists confirm the favoured theory for the moon 's creation - that it formed out of the debris kicked up in a collision between earth and a mars-sized body about four and a half billion years ago .
smart will cut a technological path for other probes to follow if this is correct , d-cixs should find that the moon contains less iron than the earth , in proportion to lighter elements such as magnesium and aluminium .
if all goes well , many of smart 's technologies - particularly its communication , navigation and propulsion systems - should find their way on to the next generation of european spacecraft .
the bepi-colombo mission to mercury , for example , which should launch at the end of this decade , is set to use an ion drive .
dr foing said : " the goal is to get more knowledge about the universe , about the solar system , and to educate the public about our origins , about scientific challenges .
" it 's also to challenge new technologies , which later will have a spin-off for the daily life of our citizens . "
how smart 1's ion drive engine works 1 .
xenon gas atoms are pumped into a cylindrical chamber , where they collide with electrons from the cathode .
the electrons - which are negatively charged - knock electrons off the xenon atoms , creating xenon ions - which are positively charged .
2 .
coils outside the chamber create a magnetic field , which causes electrons from the cathode to spiral and become trapped at the mouth of the chamber .
3 .
the build-up of negatively-charged electrons at the mouth of the chamber attracts the positively-charged ions , accelerating them out of the chamber .
4 .
the stream of accelerated ions leaving the chamber thrusts the spacecraft forward .
although the force is small , over time it creates great speed in the frictionless environment of space .

giant impact theory suggests mars-sized object crashed into early earth debris thrown into space aggregated into the moon supported by similar composition of earth and moon rocks it is a technology demonstrator and has been built in a short time and very cheaply .
the total bill has come to just 110 million euro -lrb- £ 76m -rrb- , including launch fees .
this has been achieved partly by using new management methods but also by using novel techniques of miniaturisation and design .
at only a metre square in size and weighing just 367 kilograms , it could almost be a space toy .
but smart is packed with kit that will change the nature of future high-budget missions from europe .
new thrust of major interest is the solar-electric propulsion system that will push smart towards the moon .
the engine works by expelling a beam of charged xenon atoms - ions - out of the back of the probe .
this produces a thrust in the opposite direction and pushes the spacecraft forward .
click here to see how smart 1 's ion drive engine works the experimental engine is scheduled to be switched on on tuesday .
the energy to feed the system comes from the solar panels , hence the term " solar-electric " .
ion drives accelerate slower than chemical rockets ion drives do not produce the sudden burst of forward momentum you get from a chemical rocket .
but over the long-term they are considerably more efficient and many future probes will use them .
scientists have been developing ion-drives for decades but it is only recently that they have been used in real space applications .
this is principally because new developments in photocell technology have greatly improved the effectiveness of spacecraft solar wings .
the 1998 us probe deep space 1 flew with an ion drive , and there is a european satellite , artemis , that maintains its orbit with one .
nevertheless , over short distances , ion drives are quite slow .
smart will take 15 months to reach its target .
wrong rocks " we will spiral out progressively ... up to the point where we will start to feel the attraction of the moon , " said dr bernard foing , smart 1 project scientist .
" further , we will have a spiral down , to be closer to the moon , and then we will reach the final science orbit , from where we can do all the observations that we want to take . "
and that is where some of the new miniaturised instruments will come into play .
one of them , d-cixs , a uk contribution to the project , developed at the rutherton appleton laboratory in oxfordshire , will make the most comprehensive inventory of key chemical elements in the lunar surface .
" we think we know what the moon is made of because the apollo astronauts went there and brought back half a tonne of rock samples .
" but they went to the earth side , on the equator and on the flat bits , " said professor manuel grande , on the instrument team .
" those areas are n't typical and , importantly , they 're not the ancient ones .
what we need to do is a global survey of what the moon is made of - and smart 1 with our x-ray spectrometer will do that . "
next step this information will help scientists confirm the favoured theory for the moon 's creation - that it formed out of the debris kicked up in a collision between earth and a mars-sized body about four and a half billion years ago .
smart will cut a technological path for other probes to follow if this is correct , d-cixs should find that the moon contains less iron than the earth , in proportion to lighter elements such as magnesium and aluminium .
if all goes well , many of smart 's technologies - particularly its communication , navigation and propulsion systems - should find their way on to the next generation of european spacecraft .
the bepi-colombo mission to mercury , for example , which should launch at the end of this decade , is set to use an ion drive .
dr foing said : " the goal is to get more knowledge about the universe , about the solar system , and to educate the public about our origins , about scientific challenges .
" it 's also to challenge new technologies , which later will have a spin-off for the daily life of our citizens . "
how smart 1's ion drive engine works 1 .
xenon gas atoms are pumped into a cylindrical chamber , where they collide with electrons from the cathode .
the electrons - which are negatively charged - knock electrons off the xenon atoms , creating xenon ions - which are positively charged .
2 .
coils outside the chamber create a magnetic field , which causes electrons from the cathode to spiral and become trapped at the mouth of the chamber .
3 .
the build-up of negatively-charged electrons at the mouth of the chamber attracts the positively-charged ions , accelerating them out of the chamber .
4 .
the stream of accelerated ions leaving the chamber thrusts the spacecraft forward .
although the force is small , over time it creates great speed in the frictionless environment of space .

the smart 1 probe blasted off from the kourou spaceport in french guiana at 2314 gmt .
forty-two minutes later , ground controllers said the spacecraft had been released successfully from its ariane 5 rocket launcher and was on its correct course .
smart 1 will test a novel type of propulsion system on its journey to the moon and then map the lunar body 's surface features when it arrives in 2005 .
" just because the astronauts went to the moon does n't mean they found out everything there is to find out , " said professor david southwood , the head of science at the european space agency .
the unmanned smart 1 craft will look for water on the moon .
the probe will also gather precise data on its chemical make-up .
this information should confirm the theory that the moon was created in a collision between earth and another object not long after our solar system came into being .

" abandoning nuclear activities or enrichment is not something that iran is ready to compromise on , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told a weekly news conference .
earlier this month , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- had demanded in a resolution that iran cease all uranium enrichment .
the agency has given iran until the end of october to provide evidence that it is not trying to produce nuclear weapons .
more talks but tehran insists all its nuclear activity is geared to producing enough electricity from atomic power to meet growing demand and denies it is developing nuclear weapons .
a delegation from the iaea is to due to arrive on thursday for further talks on its nuclear programme , iranian officials said .
the visit had been planned to take place nearly a week earlier but was postponed at iran 's request .
the agency is seeking answers on questions such as how highly-enriched uranium particles came to be found in at least one iranian facility .
the delay of nearly a week , made at iran 's request , was almost certainly because iranian leaders had yet to decide what line to take in the wake of the iaea resolution and its deadline , our correspondent in tehran jim muir says .
many prominent hardliners have been arguing that iran should pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty altogether .
moderate voices have urged compliance , although nobody wants iran to be seen to be bowing to american pressures , he adds .
the us and russian presidents , speaking after a camp david summit on saturday , urged iran to step up its co-operation with the iaea .
co-operation the iaea team which arrives on thursday is composed of high-ranking agency officials who will be talking with iranian leaders to assess whether the required co-operation will be forthcoming .
if all goes well , a team of technical experts , especially in the field of uranium enrichment , will follow to start work on the ground .
iranian officials have said they will co-operate with the agency but say they will not give in to pressure , particularly on signing an additional protocol which would allow tough , unannounced inspections .
the agency has said the protocol itself if not a top priority but that practical co-operation and answering questions is more important .

agency experts believe the weed only appeared at davidstow this summer but it has already occupied an area the size of a tennis court .
another outbreak of the weed caused extensive damage to a number of important wetland habitats , including exminster marshes in devon , earlier in the year .

award-winning puddings from the bury black pudding co .
competitors from as far afield as australia have gathered at a pub in greater manchester for one of the most bizarre competitions in the world .
the royal oak in the village of ramsbottom , near bury , was hosting the world black pudding throwing championship on sunday .
the competition was saved from closure by the pub after the previous venue - the corner pin pub in rossendale , lancashire - shut down .
the aim of the annual tournament is for each competitor to try and knock some yorkshire puddings off a wooden platform 20 feet up the pub wall with three throws of a black pudding .
it is believed the contest is a revival of the lancashire-yorkshire rivalry .
historically bury , now part of greater manchester , was in lancashire .
one legend says the event is based on a battle during the wars of the roses .
both armies are said to have ran out of ammunition and instead threw food at each other .
councillor tim chamberlain , of bury council , said : " this is a uniquely lancastrian event , a unique feature of the area 's events calendar , a boost for tourism and great showcase for one of bury 's most famous products . "
black pudding is a lancashire delicacy , made of cooked pigs ' blood , fat and rusk , encased in a length of intestine .
it first arrived in the uk centuries ago with some european monks who visited yorkshire before making the trip over the pennines to lancashire where the food was given the name black pudding .

mr blair said : " we should keep the option open .
" let us as a country decide when we want to exercise that option .
" i do n't see any point , irrespective of what happens in sweden , of ruling anything out .
let 's keep our options open .

mr blair has long been a supporter of euro membership , as long as conditions for joining are right , and has pledged that their will be a referendum on the issue as soon as they are .
but in june , chancellor gordon brown announced that only one of the government 's five tests for euro entry had so far been passed .
rejection he will decide in his next budget whether circumstances have changed enough to justify re-running the tests .
but after swedish voters rejected the euro in a referendum two weeks ago , pro and anti-euro campaigners in the uk believe the chances of a vote before the next election have all but disappeared .
coupled with the prime minister 's waning popularity - as a result of the war in iraq and subsequent hutton inquiry - many analysts also claim he is unlikely to risk an uphill campaign to win over sceptical britons to the merits of euro membership .
the news comes soon after the bbc learned that simon buckby director of pro-euro campaign group britain in europe is likely to step down after the organisation is restructured .
mr buckby is understood to be frustrated at the government 's failure to pursue a coherent policy on the euro .
he told bbc news 24 that he would consider his future in the post after his organisation had been restructured in the light of delays in holding a referendum .
