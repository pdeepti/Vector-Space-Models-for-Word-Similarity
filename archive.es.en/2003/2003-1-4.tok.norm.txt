the lander – named after the ship charles darwin sailed in to explore unchartered areas of the earth in 1831 – will be integrated with the spacecraft in toulouse , france , thus nearing the end of preparations for the summer launch of an exploratory mission to mars .
the mission , whose goal is to search for sub-surface water from orbit and to deliver the lander to mars , is expected to be launched in june and to land on mars in december .
it is timed to coincide with mars ' closest approach to earth in 17 years , which takes place in august 2003 .
the distance between mars and earth varies because they have elliptical orbits .
by launching the mission during the closest approach , the spacecraft will take the shortest possible route , thereby costing less than a longer trip would .
precursor to manned mission to mars the mars express is a precursor to later manned missions to mars , which scientists say could happen in the next 15 to 25 years .
indeed , preparations for such a mission are already under way .
on thursday , medical researchers in berlin put out a call for volunteers to participate in a study that will seek to determine how the astronauts – who are expected to be under way for two years for the mars mission – can counter the effects of long-term weightlessness .
long-term exposure to weightlessness damages muscles and bones and the researchers are hoping to come up with ways to ensure that the astronauts do n't break their legs once the get out of the spacecraft for the first mars walk .
the study , conducted by doctors at the free university of berlin in conjunction with the european space agency , is scheduled to begin in february and will last for two months .
during this time , some 20 volunteers will live under conditions that simulate that of the astronauts on the mars mission .
namely , they will live in simulated weightlessness and will be allowed no contact with other people .
destination : mars david hall , director of science at the british national space centre in london , told bbc news online that by 2025 , europe will likely have the expertise to send a human to mars .
but the costs for such a mission are likely higher than europe can afford on its own , thus the european space agency is eyeing collaborations with the united states , japan , russia and perhaps even china , according to the bbc .
russian scientists announced this summer that they were planning to send people to mars by 2015 – but noted that they needed international cooperation for the mission to succeed .
in the works is a 440-day mission with six people , with a price tag of about $ 20 billion , according to the bbc .
the russians last attempt to launch a spacecraft to mars , in 1996 , ended in failure after the spacecraft crashed into the pacific ocean .
comet mission delayed failed missions are certainly on the minds of european space scientists following the december 11 mid-air explosion of an ariane-5 rocket .
this delayed the launch of the rosetta spacecraft , which was set to be launched by an older version of this rocket launcher .
the rosetta launch had been scheduled for january 12 , but officials now say they will disclose a new launch date on january 11 .
the rosetta is supposed to make an eight-year trip to the comet wirtanen the project has been 10 years in the making , and scientists are on edge as planetary conditions dictate that the launch must take place by early february in order to succeed .

the lander – named after the ship charles darwin sailed in to explore unchartered areas of the earth in 1831 – will be integrated with the spacecraft in toulouse , france , thus nearing the end of preparations for the summer launch of an exploratory mission to mars .
the mission , whose goal is to search for sub-surface water from orbit and to deliver the lander to mars , is expected to be launched in june and to land on mars in december .
it is timed to coincide with mars ' closest approach to earth in 17 years , which takes place in august 2003 .
the distance between mars and earth varies because they have elliptical orbits .
by launching the mission during the closest approach , the spacecraft will take the shortest possible route , thereby costing less than a longer trip would .
precursor to manned mission to mars the mars express is a precursor to later manned missions to mars , which scientists say could happen in the next 15 to 25 years .
indeed , preparations for such a mission are already under way .
on thursday , medical researchers in berlin put out a call for volunteers to participate in a study that will seek to determine how the astronauts – who are expected to be under way for two years for the mars mission – can counter the effects of long-term weightlessness .
long-term exposure to weightlessness damages muscles and bones and the researchers are hoping to come up with ways to ensure that the astronauts do n't break their legs once the get out of the spacecraft for the first mars walk .
the study , conducted by doctors at the free university of berlin in conjunction with the european space agency , is scheduled to begin in february and will last for two months .
during this time , some 20 volunteers will live under conditions that simulate that of the astronauts on the mars mission .
namely , they will live in simulated weightlessness and will be allowed no contact with other people .
destination : mars david hall , director of science at the british national space centre in london , told bbc news online that by 2025 , europe will likely have the expertise to send a human to mars .
but the costs for such a mission are likely higher than europe can afford on its own , thus the european space agency is eyeing collaborations with the united states , japan , russia and perhaps even china , according to the bbc .
russian scientists announced this summer that they were planning to send people to mars by 2015 – but noted that they needed international cooperation for the mission to succeed .
in the works is a 440-day mission with six people , with a price tag of about $ 20 billion , according to the bbc .
the russians last attempt to launch a spacecraft to mars , in 1996 , ended in failure after the spacecraft crashed into the pacific ocean .

this delayed the launch of the rosetta spacecraft , which was set to be launched by an older version of this rocket launcher .
the rosetta launch had been scheduled for january 12 , but officials now say they will disclose a new launch date on january 11 .

the lander – named after the ship charles darwin sailed in to explore unchartered areas of the earth in 1831 – will be integrated with the spacecraft in toulouse , france , thus nearing the end of preparations for the summer launch of an exploratory mission to mars .
the mission , whose goal is to search for sub-surface water from orbit and to deliver the lander to mars , is expected to be launched in june and to land on mars in december .
it is timed to coincide with mars ' closest approach to earth in 17 years , which takes place in august 2003 .
the distance between mars and earth varies because they have elliptical orbits .
by launching the mission during the closest approach , the spacecraft will take the shortest possible route , thereby costing less than a longer trip would .
precursor to manned mission to mars the mars express is a precursor to later manned missions to mars , which scientists say could happen in the next 15 to 25 years .
indeed , preparations for such a mission are already under way .
on thursday , medical researchers in berlin put out a call for volunteers to participate in a study that will seek to determine how the astronauts – who are expected to be under way for two years for the mars mission – can counter the effects of long-term weightlessness .
long-term exposure to weightlessness damages muscles and bones and the researchers are hoping to come up with ways to ensure that the astronauts do n't break their legs once the get out of the spacecraft for the first mars walk .
the study , conducted by doctors at the free university of berlin in conjunction with the european space agency , is scheduled to begin in february and will last for two months .
during this time , some 20 volunteers will live under conditions that simulate that of the astronauts on the mars mission .
namely , they will live in simulated weightlessness and will be allowed no contact with other people .

but the costs for such a mission are likely higher than europe can afford on its own , thus the european space agency is eyeing collaborations with the united states , japan , russia and perhaps even china , according to the bbc .
russian scientists announced this summer that they were planning to send people to mars by 2015 – but noted that they needed international cooperation for the mission to succeed .
in the works is a 440-day mission with six people , with a price tag of about $ 20 billion , according to the bbc .

the lander – named after the ship charles darwin sailed in to explore unchartered areas of the earth in 1831 – will be integrated with the spacecraft in toulouse , france , thus nearing the end of preparations for the summer launch of an exploratory mission to mars .
the mission , whose goal is to search for sub-surface water from orbit and to deliver the lander to mars , is expected to be launched in june and to land on mars in december .
it is timed to coincide with mars ' closest approach to earth in 17 years , which takes place in august 2003 .
the distance between mars and earth varies because they have elliptical orbits .
by launching the mission during the closest approach , the spacecraft will take the shortest possible route , thereby costing less than a longer trip would .
precursor to manned mission to mars the mars express is a precursor to later manned missions to mars , which scientists say could happen in the next 15 to 25 years .
indeed , preparations for such a mission are already under way .
on thursday , medical researchers in berlin put out a call for volunteers to participate in a study that will seek to determine how the astronauts – who are expected to be under way for two years for the mars mission – can counter the effects of long-term weightlessness .
long-term exposure to weightlessness damages muscles and bones and the researchers are hoping to come up with ways to ensure that the astronauts do n't break their legs once the get out of the spacecraft for the first mars walk .
the study , conducted by doctors at the free university of berlin in conjunction with the european space agency , is scheduled to begin in february and will last for two months .
during this time , some 20 volunteers will live under conditions that simulate that of the astronauts on the mars mission .
namely , they will live in simulated weightlessness and will be allowed no contact with other people .

russian scientists announced this summer that they were planning to send people to mars by 2015 – but noted that they needed international cooperation for the mission to succeed .

the lander – named after the ship charles darwin sailed in to explore unchartered areas of the earth in 1831 – will be integrated with the spacecraft in toulouse , france , thus nearing the end of preparations for the summer launch of an exploratory mission to mars .
the mission , whose goal is to search for sub-surface water from orbit and to deliver the lander to mars , is expected to be launched in june and to land on mars in december .
it is timed to coincide with mars ' closest approach to earth in 17 years , which takes place in august 2003 .
the distance between mars and earth varies because they have elliptical orbits .
by launching the mission during the closest approach , the spacecraft will take the shortest possible route , thereby costing less than a longer trip would .
precursor to manned mission to mars the mars express is a precursor to later manned missions to mars , which scientists say could happen in the next 15 to 25 years .
indeed , preparations for such a mission are already under way .
on thursday , medical researchers in berlin put out a call for volunteers to participate in a study that will seek to determine how the astronauts – who are expected to be under way for two years for the mars mission – can counter the effects of long-term weightlessness .
long-term exposure to weightlessness damages muscles and bones and the researchers are hoping to come up with ways to ensure that the astronauts do n't break their legs once the get out of the spacecraft for the first mars walk .
the study , conducted by doctors at the free university of berlin in conjunction with the european space agency , is scheduled to begin in february and will last for two months .
during this time , some 20 volunteers will live under conditions that simulate that of the astronauts on the mars mission .
namely , they will live in simulated weightlessness and will be allowed no contact with other people .
destination : mars david hall , director of science at the british national space centre in london , told bbc news online that by 2025 , europe will likely have the expertise to send a human to mars .
but the costs for such a mission are likely higher than europe can afford on its own , thus the european space agency is eyeing collaborations with the united states , japan , russia and perhaps even china , according to the bbc .
russian scientists announced this summer that they were planning to send people to mars by 2015 – but noted that they needed international cooperation for the mission to succeed .
in the works is a 440-day mission with six people , with a price tag of about $ 20 billion , according to the bbc .
the russians last attempt to launch a spacecraft to mars , in 1996 , ended in failure after the spacecraft crashed into the pacific ocean .
comet mission delayed failed missions are certainly on the minds of european space scientists following the december 11 mid-air explosion of an ariane-5 rocket .
this delayed the launch of the rosetta spacecraft , which was set to be launched by an older version of this rocket launcher .
the rosetta launch had been scheduled for january 12 , but officials now say they will disclose a new launch date on january 11 .
the rosetta is supposed to make an eight-year trip to the comet wirtanen the project has been 10 years in the making , and scientists are on edge as planetary conditions dictate that the launch must take place by early february in order to succeed .

the lander – named after the ship charles darwin sailed in to explore unchartered areas of the earth in 1831 – will be integrated with the spacecraft in toulouse , france , thus nearing the end of preparations for the summer launch of an exploratory mission to mars .
the mission , whose goal is to search for sub-surface water from orbit and to deliver the lander to mars , is expected to be launched in june and to land on mars in december .
it is timed to coincide with mars ' closest approach to earth in 17 years , which takes place in august 2003 .

russian scientists announced this summer that they were planning to send people to mars by 2015 – but noted that they needed international cooperation for the mission to succeed .
in the works is a 440-day mission with six people , with a price tag of about $ 20 billion , according to the bbc .

however , researchers found that the drug may cause damage to the optic nerves of people whose blood vessels are already in a poor state .
and they still can not explain why taking the drug seems to be linked to problems in picking up subtle changes of colour .
when viagra was introduced in 1999 , the drug 's manufacturers warned of a number of visual side effects , including possible nerve damage to the eyes .
but researchers at the university of california , irvine found that nerve damage in healthy people is extremely unlikely - even when viagra is taken in high doses .
blood pressure since viagra lowers blood pressure overall , there was persistent suspicion that the drug might reduce blood flow to the eyes , which can cause nerve damage .
but dr tim mcculley , assistant professor of ophthalmology at irvine , said there was no evidence that taking the drug had any significant impact on reducing blood flow in the eyes .
dr mcculley said : " viagra can change blood vessel structure as well as general blood pressure , so we needed to answer the question whether the drug could change blood vessels in the eye .
viagra is linked to difficulty discerning colour " our study may have had a small group of participants , but it showed very little change in blood vessels or blood flow in nearly all the patients . "
the researchers carried out tests on 13 patients .
they found that high doses of viagra by and large preserved the thickness of the eye 's choroids layer , which supplies the eyeball with blood .
however , the team did find some small variations in thickness , which indicated that some people with underlying vascular diseases may indeed have changes in vision .
colour vision the researchers found that viagra users had a harder time discriminating subtle changes of colour .
however , this problem did not appear to be linked to changes to blood flow to the eyes .
the cone cells of the retina , responsible for colour vision , contain an enzyme similar to a chemical called phosphodiesterase which is inhibited by viagra .
it may be that the drug disrupts the function of this enzyme .
dr derek machin , a urologist based at university hospital aintree , told bbc news online that he had treated about 300 patients with viagra , and very few had experienced significant side effects .
" the vast majority of patients do n't complain of any side effects apart from a slight fuzzy-headedness that does not prevent them taking the drug .
" i have had just two chaps who developed raging headaches .
" the results produced by viagra have been absolutely superb . "
the research is published in the journal ophthalmologica .

appeals for information have so far produced a disappointing response and detectives hope reward money totalling £ 35,000 may prompt more of the 100 people who were at the same party as the girls to come forward .
they said the girls - who were all related - were innocent victims of what was probably a feud between rival gangs . "
the only thing that needs to happen for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing " chief superintendent kevin morris more than 30 shots were fired from at least two weapons , including a sub machine gun , during the attack at a hair salon in the aston area of the city on thursday .
charlene ellis , 18 , and latisha shakespeare , 17 were killed in the shooting , while charlene 's twin sister , sophie , and 17-year-old cheryl shaw were injured .
cheryl has returned home , but sophie ellis remains under armed guard in hospital , where her condition is described as stable .
post-mortem examinations on saturday found that latisha died from a gunshot wound to the chest while charlene had been shot in the head .
the shooting has led to calls for tighter controls on people carrying guns in the uk .
' absolutely traumatised ' police released a picture of the friends taken hours before they were killed in an attempt to find the gunmen .
rewards offered daily mail : £ 25,000 birmingham evening mail and victims of crime group : £ 10,000 detective superintendent dave mirfield , leading the murder hunt , said : " these girls were not members of any gang , they were merely on a night out with friends . "
mr mirfield , who backed the £ 35,000 rewards offered by newspapers and a crime victim group , said there appeared to be a fear or reluctance to come forward among potential witnesses .
although about 100 people were thought to have been at the salon only 30 were still there when officers arrived .
the chairman of the birmingham racial attacks monitoring unit , maxi hayles , said there was room for the police to improve the way they dealt with black-on-black crime .
but he also urged anyone with any information about the attack to come forward .
mr hayles said : " we 're appealing to the black community to come forward and assist the police .
" and at the same time , the police must provide the appropriate channel of protection for the community . "
he said he wanted to see a witness protection scheme set up as soon as possible . "
there are certainly elements in the community who are scared to come forward " steve mccabe labour mp for hall green chief superintendent kevin morris , president of the police superintendents association of england and wales , admitted the criminal justice system had not been " particularly good " at protecting witnesses .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " perhaps we need to tighten up on the way we deal with witnesses to make sure that they are anonymous from the criminals themselves and that they are protected from any retribution that may follow . "
mr morris said the association was pressing the government to change the law to curb the conversion of replica guns and air weapons into lethal weapons .
' violent gangs ' people caught with illegal firearms could face at least five years in jail under government plans being considered in response to rising gun crime .
home secretary david blunkett is reportedly ready to add new minimum jail terms for possession of firearms to the criminal justice bill .
steve mccabe , labour mp for hall green , said : " i think there 's the danger that there are very aggressive violent gangs mostly associated with the drugs trade and i think that there are certainly elements in the community who are scared to come forward .
" but this is really about the availability of guns and we 've really got to tackle that in order to clamp down on these people . "
chief constable chris fox , vice president of the association of chief police officers , told today the country 's gun problem was complicated .
he said tackling the problem involved targeting the dealers , protecting the public and finding a way to change " the mindset of someone who feels they need a weapon to protect themselves and gain respect " .

mr mirfield , who backed the £ 35,000 rewards offered by newspapers and a crime victim group , said there appeared to be a fear or reluctance to come forward among potential witnesses .

he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " perhaps we need to tighten up on the way we deal with witnesses to make sure that they are anonymous from the criminals themselves and that they are protected from any retribution that may follow . "
mr morris said the association was pressing the government to change the law to curb the conversion of replica guns and air weapons into lethal weapons .

chief constable chris fox , vice president of the association of chief police officers , told today the country 's gun problem was complicated .
he said tackling the problem involved targeting the dealers , protecting the public and finding a way to change " the mindset of someone who feels they need a weapon to protect themselves and gain respect " . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's clarence mitchell reports from birmingham " rewards totalling £ 35,000 are now being offered " the bbc 's judith moritz in birmingham " the family of latisha shakespear have laid their own tributes " lucy cope , mothers against guns " this wall of silence needs to be broken down " see also : 03 jan 03 -pipe- england gunmen fired more than 30 shots 03 jan 03 -pipe- politics gun crime crackdown ' planned ' 03 jan 03 -pipe- england shootings part of city 's violent trend 16 dec 02 -pipe- england widow appeals for end to ' gun culture ' internet links : west midlands police police superintendents ' association of england and wales association of chief police officers home office the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top england stories now : 10,000 chased for congestion fine teenagers admit festival violence postmaster sacked over robbery beckham forgives ferguson man faces nine rape charges abuse claimants win compensation 400 jobs to go at zinc works legal row cat back with owners links to more england stories are at the foot of the page .

chavez says the strikers have " a date with defeat " the secretary-general of the organisation of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , cesar gaviria , said on friday that talks between mr chavez 's government and the opposition had failed to produce a firm agreement on holding a referendum on the president 's rule .
mr chavez has suggested the formation of a " group of nation friends " , comprised of representatives from the americas and europe , which would enlist diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis .
but the bush administration has already rejected this call , saying mediation attempts by the oas should suffice .
mr chavez has also urged venezuela 's neighbours to come to the rescue of its beleaguered oil industry , by forming a " latin opec " or a regional cartel of oil exporters .
it would consist of state oil firms from venezuela , brazil , ecuador , colombia and trinidad and tobago .
