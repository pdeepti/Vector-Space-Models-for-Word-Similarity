in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.08.2003 youth festival ties the future to prora 's past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after many incarnations , part of the massive prora complex is to become a youth hostel .
thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .
he lacks charisma and support from the people .
the paper wrote he was only put in his position because of american and israeli pressure .
it noted his political career could possibly be saved if he honestly made a move to stop the militant groups hamas and islamic jihad .
but , the paper concluded , in order for him and the peace plan to succeed , he needs more help than a friendly invitation from washington . germany ’ s frankfurter rundschau commented on iraq ’ s dilemma .

last week un headquarters was bombed where un top envoy sergio de mello and 19 colleagues were killed , and recently three british soldiers were killed in basra .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .
he lacks charisma and support from the people .
the paper wrote he was only put in his position because of american and israeli pressure .
it noted his political career could possibly be saved if he honestly made a move to stop the militant groups hamas and islamic jihad .
but , the paper concluded , in order for him and the peace plan to succeed , he needs more help than a friendly invitation from washington . germany ’ s frankfurter rundschau commented on iraq ’ s dilemma .
since the end of major combats in may , there have been many coalition casualties .

sailor and passionate badminton player bill brandes was fed up of playing such a slow , wind dependant game and wanted something to be able to play on the deck of a ship .
more than seven years later , brandes had developed a shuttlecock which was by far faster and lighter than the usual badminton shuttle .
together with a group of friends , brandes founded a small firm and in the following years designed and developed special racquets and thought up simple rules for those who prefer a proper match .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .
he and schröder have planned talks for saturday morning where they will discuss various eu issues , including a september trip to new york to address the un general assembly . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares over german role in iraq germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .

the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .

nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .
he lacks charisma and support from the people .
the paper wrote he was only put in his position because of american and israeli pressure .
it noted his political career could possibly be saved if he honestly made a move to stop the militant groups hamas and islamic jihad .
but , the paper concluded , in order for him and the peace plan to succeed , he needs more help than a friendly invitation from washington . germany ’ s frankfurter rundschau commented on iraq ’ s dilemma .
since the end of major combats in may , there have been many coalition casualties .
last week un headquarters was bombed where un top envoy sergio de mello and 19 colleagues were killed , and recently three british soldiers were killed in basra .
it ’ s become a guessing game to figure out who is carrying out the attacks – saddam loyalists , al-qaeda ... the paper said anything is possible and such terrorism is exactly what u.s. president bush wanted to avoid with his regime change in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .

when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .

although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .

a wave of television revival shows on life in former communist east germany have hit the airwaves in germany .
critics fear they play down the repressive reality of the system . the song was a positive one , forward-looking .
" rising from the ruins and turning toward the future , " it began .
now it 's only the first line of a defunct national anthem that symbolized the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- for 40 years .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , communist east germany ceased to exist and the soul-searching began .
victims , perpetrators , historians and politicians re-evaluated their experiences in the second dictatorship on german territory , rewrote history .
many east and west germans wanted nothing more than to forget the former state that disappeared 14 years ago .
now however the gdr is making a comeback , albeit in a softer light .
as east german products and lifestyles become " cool " and " fashionable " , the surge of nostalgia for a lost world even has a new nickname - ostalgie - a play on the german words for east -lrb- o st -rrb- and " nostalgia " -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- . the focus is on " normal , " everyday life in the communist east minus the oppressiveness imposed by a totalitarian regime .
after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .
zdf , mdr and sat.1 began airing their retrospectives of everyday life in the gdr over the past ten days .
this week the rtl version is set to take off .
distorting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but critics are concerned that the new ostalgie wave distorts the past and plays down the unjustness of the east german state .
the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , dieter althaus , has warned that reviews of the gdr must reflect reality instead of being nostalgic .
leipzig media expert hans-jörg stiehler has said the new ostalgie supplants political discussion of the gdr legacy .
psychotherapist hans-joachim maaz has claimed the trend is superficial and that it should n't be allowed to play down the inhumane sides of the system .
the broadcasters , accused of trying to cash in on ostalgie , disagreed .
the show was n't supposed to deal with the political gdr , rather it was meant to show different facets of life in the gdr .
" for the east german , the program affords reminiscences , the west german receives whole new insights , " is how sat.1 spokeswoman jutta kehrer explained ostalgie .
the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .
the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "
around 37 percent thought negative aspects of the gdr should also be shown , and 38 percent said it was fine to be reminded exclusively of the positive features of the east german state .
the real profit-makers may be found elsewhere .
" the television shows and the hype about the gdr are extremely helpful , " jens rückriem of ossiversand.de , an online store that sells east german products and memorabilia , told reuters .
rückriem estimated that sales would grow by 10-15 percent thanks to the new ostalgie . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german art retrospective sparks debate the biggest-ever retrospective of east german art , which conspicuously avoids the socialist realism favored by the communist regime , opened in berlin this week amid a wave of nostalgia and controversy .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .
he lacks charisma and support from the people .
the paper wrote he was only put in his position because of american and israeli pressure .
it noted his political career could possibly be saved if he honestly made a move to stop the militant groups hamas and islamic jihad .
but , the paper concluded , in order for him and the peace plan to succeed , he needs more help than a friendly invitation from washington . germany ’ s frankfurter rundschau commented on iraq ’ s dilemma .
since the end of major combats in may , there have been many coalition casualties .
last week un headquarters was bombed where un top envoy sergio de mello and 19 colleagues were killed , and recently three british soldiers were killed in basra .
it ’ s become a guessing game to figure out who is carrying out the attacks – saddam loyalists , al-qaeda ... the paper said anything is possible and such terrorism is exactly what u.s. president bush wanted to avoid with his regime change in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .
the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "
around 37 percent thought negative aspects of the gdr should also be shown , and 38 percent said it was fine to be reminded exclusively of the positive features of the east german state .
the real profit-makers may be found elsewhere .
" the television shows and the hype about the gdr are extremely helpful , " jens rückriem of ossiversand.de , an online store that sells east german products and memorabilia , told reuters .
rückriem estimated that sales would grow by 10-15 percent thanks to the new ostalgie . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german art retrospective sparks debate the biggest-ever retrospective of east german art , which conspicuously avoids the socialist realism favored by the communist regime , opened in berlin this week amid a wave of nostalgia and controversy .

created in berlin , the sport is now catching on all over the world . it 's summer in berlin , temperatures are rising and with it the desire to be out in the park and to relax in the fresh air .
barbeques are forbidden , picnics are boring , " speeding , " however is not - according to a growing number of young berliners .
officially called " speedminton , " the game - a mixture of tennis , squash and badminton - is the summer activity in the city .
played until recently , in typical berlin manner illegally in the city 's parks , the game has now made its breakthrough as an official sport .
this summer it won an award at the international sports fair in munich .
" its like a virus , " creator thomas von klier says .
" and its spreading fast . "
faster and lighter it all began on a boat .
sailor and passionate badminton player bill brandes was fed up of playing such a slow , wind dependant game and wanted something to be able to play on the deck of a ship .
more than seven years later , brandes had developed a shuttlecock which was by far faster and lighter than the usual badminton shuttle .
together with a group of friends , brandes founded a small firm and in the following years designed and developed special racquets and thought up simple rules for those who prefer a proper match .
for the winter , co-creator von klier and his colleagues developed an indoor version using half a tennis court - making it playable throughout the year .
" its like a drug , " von klier says .
" once you get hooked , you just ca n't stop . "
from coburg to cairo von klier has played speedminton all over the world .
whether on the marketplace in quedlinburg or in the deserts of egypt , the lighting expert always takes his set of racquets and balls with him .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .

the new model , which is the fifth generation of vw 's most popular car , will be wider and higher than its predecessor , launched back in 1997 .
as the wolfsburg-based company struggles with slumping sales figures , there are high hopes among both management and employees that the new model will bring about a turn in vw 's fortunes .
company bosses are aiming to sell some 135,000 models of the new car before the end of the year , and are predicting the sales of 600,000 in 2004 .
but with production still in the early stages , and the first examples of the new model not scheduled to hit the salesrooms until october , it will likely be spring before volkswagen starts to see the returns needed to put an end to its two years of financial woes . more briefs 25.08.2003 -pipe- cigarette makers set to hike prices 22.08.2003 -pipe- pension contributions set to rise 21.08.2003 -pipe- small trade group sees fewer apprentices 21.08.2003 -pipe- deutsche bahn first-half loss narrows 21.08.2003 -pipe- deutsche bank fined by u.s. sec 20.08.2003 -pipe- bayer gets u.s. approval for viagra rival 20.08.2003 -pipe- cabinet favors end to hedge fund ban 20.08.2003 -pipe- continental to join dax , mlp ejected radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .
he lacks charisma and support from the people .
the paper wrote he was only put in his position because of american and israeli pressure .
it noted his political career could possibly be saved if he honestly made a move to stop the militant groups hamas and islamic jihad .
but , the paper concluded , in order for him and the peace plan to succeed , he needs more help than a friendly invitation from washington . germany ’ s frankfurter rundschau commented on iraq ’ s dilemma .
since the end of major combats in may , there have been many coalition casualties .
last week un headquarters was bombed where un top envoy sergio de mello and 19 colleagues were killed , and recently three british soldiers were killed in basra .
it ’ s become a guessing game to figure out who is carrying out the attacks – saddam loyalists , al-qaeda ... the paper said anything is possible and such terrorism is exactly what u.s. president bush wanted to avoid with his regime change in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.08.2003 youth festival ties the future to prora 's past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after many incarnations , part of the massive prora complex is to become a youth hostel .
thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.08.2003 youth festival ties the future to prora 's past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after many incarnations , part of the massive prora complex is to become a youth hostel .
thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .
reading from hitler ’ s “ mein kampf ” provokes furor a planned reading from hitler ’ s autobiography " mein kampf " has sparked much debate in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-west pomerania .
hitler 's unrealized dream in poland as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .
sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .
reading from hitler ’ s “ mein kampf ” provokes furor a planned reading from hitler ’ s autobiography " mein kampf " has sparked much debate in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-west pomerania .
hitler 's unrealized dream in poland as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .
sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

a wave of television revival shows on life in former communist east germany have hit the airwaves in germany .
critics fear they play down the repressive reality of the system . the song was a positive one , forward-looking .
" rising from the ruins and turning toward the future , " it began .
now it 's only the first line of a defunct national anthem that symbolized the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- for 40 years .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , communist east germany ceased to exist and the soul-searching began .
victims , perpetrators , historians and politicians re-evaluated their experiences in the second dictatorship on german territory , rewrote history .
many east and west germans wanted nothing more than to forget the former state that disappeared 14 years ago .
now however the gdr is making a comeback , albeit in a softer light .
as east german products and lifestyles become " cool " and " fashionable " , the surge of nostalgia for a lost world even has a new nickname - ostalgie - a play on the german words for east -lrb- o st -rrb- and " nostalgia " -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- . the focus is on " normal , " everyday life in the communist east minus the oppressiveness imposed by a totalitarian regime .
after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .
zdf , mdr and sat.1 began airing their retrospectives of everyday life in the gdr over the past ten days .
this week the rtl version is set to take off .
distorting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but critics are concerned that the new ostalgie wave distorts the past and plays down the unjustness of the east german state .
the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , dieter althaus , has warned that reviews of the gdr must reflect reality instead of being nostalgic .
leipzig media expert hans-jörg stiehler has said the new ostalgie supplants political discussion of the gdr legacy .
psychotherapist hans-joachim maaz has claimed the trend is superficial and that it should n't be allowed to play down the inhumane sides of the system .
the broadcasters , accused of trying to cash in on ostalgie , disagreed .
the show was n't supposed to deal with the political gdr , rather it was meant to show different facets of life in the gdr .
" for the east german , the program affords reminiscences , the west german receives whole new insights , " is how sat.1 spokeswoman jutta kehrer explained ostalgie .
the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .
the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "
around 37 percent thought negative aspects of the gdr should also be shown , and 38 percent said it was fine to be reminded exclusively of the positive features of the east german state .
the real profit-makers may be found elsewhere .
" the television shows and the hype about the gdr are extremely helpful , " jens rückriem of ossiversand.de , an online store that sells east german products and memorabilia , told reuters .
rückriem estimated that sales would grow by 10-15 percent thanks to the new ostalgie . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german art retrospective sparks debate the biggest-ever retrospective of east german art , which conspicuously avoids the socialist realism favored by the communist regime , opened in berlin this week amid a wave of nostalgia and controversy .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .
he lacks charisma and support from the people .
the paper wrote he was only put in his position because of american and israeli pressure .
it noted his political career could possibly be saved if he honestly made a move to stop the militant groups hamas and islamic jihad .
but , the paper concluded , in order for him and the peace plan to succeed , he needs more help than a friendly invitation from washington . germany ’ s frankfurter rundschau commented on iraq ’ s dilemma .
since the end of major combats in may , there have been many coalition casualties .
last week un headquarters was bombed where un top envoy sergio de mello and 19 colleagues were killed , and recently three british soldiers were killed in basra .
it ’ s become a guessing game to figure out who is carrying out the attacks – saddam loyalists , al-qaeda ... the paper said anything is possible and such terrorism is exactly what u.s. president bush wanted to avoid with his regime change in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

many east and west germans wanted nothing more than to forget the former state that disappeared 14 years ago .

after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .

the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .
the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .
reading from hitler ’ s “ mein kampf ” provokes furor a planned reading from hitler ’ s autobiography " mein kampf " has sparked much debate in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-west pomerania .
hitler 's unrealized dream in poland as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .

a wave of television revival shows on life in former communist east germany have hit the airwaves in germany .
critics fear they play down the repressive reality of the system . the song was a positive one , forward-looking .
" rising from the ruins and turning toward the future , " it began .
now it 's only the first line of a defunct national anthem that symbolized the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- for 40 years .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , communist east germany ceased to exist and the soul-searching began .
victims , perpetrators , historians and politicians re-evaluated their experiences in the second dictatorship on german territory , rewrote history .
many east and west germans wanted nothing more than to forget the former state that disappeared 14 years ago .
now however the gdr is making a comeback , albeit in a softer light .
as east german products and lifestyles become " cool " and " fashionable " , the surge of nostalgia for a lost world even has a new nickname - ostalgie - a play on the german words for east -lrb- o st -rrb- and " nostalgia " -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- . the focus is on " normal , " everyday life in the communist east minus the oppressiveness imposed by a totalitarian regime .
after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .
zdf , mdr and sat.1 began airing their retrospectives of everyday life in the gdr over the past ten days .
this week the rtl version is set to take off .
distorting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but critics are concerned that the new ostalgie wave distorts the past and plays down the unjustness of the east german state .
the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , dieter althaus , has warned that reviews of the gdr must reflect reality instead of being nostalgic .
leipzig media expert hans-jörg stiehler has said the new ostalgie supplants political discussion of the gdr legacy .
psychotherapist hans-joachim maaz has claimed the trend is superficial and that it should n't be allowed to play down the inhumane sides of the system .
the broadcasters , accused of trying to cash in on ostalgie , disagreed .
the show was n't supposed to deal with the political gdr , rather it was meant to show different facets of life in the gdr .
" for the east german , the program affords reminiscences , the west german receives whole new insights , " is how sat.1 spokeswoman jutta kehrer explained ostalgie .
the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .
the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "
around 37 percent thought negative aspects of the gdr should also be shown , and 38 percent said it was fine to be reminded exclusively of the positive features of the east german state .
the real profit-makers may be found elsewhere .
" the television shows and the hype about the gdr are extremely helpful , " jens rückriem of ossiversand.de , an online store that sells east german products and memorabilia , told reuters .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .

" well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .
he and schröder have planned talks for saturday morning where they will discuss various eu issues , including a september trip to new york to address the un general assembly . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares over german role in iraq germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices .

according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .

commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .

a wave of television revival shows on life in former communist east germany have hit the airwaves in germany .
critics fear they play down the repressive reality of the system . the song was a positive one , forward-looking .
" rising from the ruins and turning toward the future , " it began .
now it 's only the first line of a defunct national anthem that symbolized the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- for 40 years .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , communist east germany ceased to exist and the soul-searching began .
victims , perpetrators , historians and politicians re-evaluated their experiences in the second dictatorship on german territory , rewrote history .
many east and west germans wanted nothing more than to forget the former state that disappeared 14 years ago .
now however the gdr is making a comeback , albeit in a softer light .
as east german products and lifestyles become " cool " and " fashionable " , the surge of nostalgia for a lost world even has a new nickname - ostalgie - a play on the german words for east -lrb- o st -rrb- and " nostalgia " -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- . the focus is on " normal , " everyday life in the communist east minus the oppressiveness imposed by a totalitarian regime .
after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .
zdf , mdr and sat.1 began airing their retrospectives of everyday life in the gdr over the past ten days .
this week the rtl version is set to take off .
distorting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but critics are concerned that the new ostalgie wave distorts the past and plays down the unjustness of the east german state .
the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , dieter althaus , has warned that reviews of the gdr must reflect reality instead of being nostalgic .
leipzig media expert hans-jörg stiehler has said the new ostalgie supplants political discussion of the gdr legacy .
psychotherapist hans-joachim maaz has claimed the trend is superficial and that it should n't be allowed to play down the inhumane sides of the system .
the broadcasters , accused of trying to cash in on ostalgie , disagreed .
the show was n't supposed to deal with the political gdr , rather it was meant to show different facets of life in the gdr .
" for the east german , the program affords reminiscences , the west german receives whole new insights , " is how sat.1 spokeswoman jutta kehrer explained ostalgie .
the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .
the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "
around 37 percent thought negative aspects of the gdr should also be shown , and 38 percent said it was fine to be reminded exclusively of the positive features of the east german state .
the real profit-makers may be found elsewhere .
" the television shows and the hype about the gdr are extremely helpful , " jens rückriem of ossiversand.de , an online store that sells east german products and memorabilia , told reuters .
rückriem estimated that sales would grow by 10-15 percent thanks to the new ostalgie . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east german art retrospective sparks debate the biggest-ever retrospective of east german art , which conspicuously avoids the socialist realism favored by the communist regime , opened in berlin this week amid a wave of nostalgia and controversy .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .
reading from hitler ’ s “ mein kampf ” provokes furor a planned reading from hitler ’ s autobiography " mein kampf " has sparked much debate in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-west pomerania .
hitler 's unrealized dream in poland as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .
reading from hitler ’ s “ mein kampf ” provokes furor a planned reading from hitler ’ s autobiography " mein kampf " has sparked much debate in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-west pomerania .
hitler 's unrealized dream in poland as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .
sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction .

created in berlin , the sport is now catching on all over the world . it 's summer in berlin , temperatures are rising and with it the desire to be out in the park and to relax in the fresh air .
barbeques are forbidden , picnics are boring , " speeding , " however is not - according to a growing number of young berliners .
officially called " speedminton , " the game - a mixture of tennis , squash and badminton - is the summer activity in the city .
played until recently , in typical berlin manner illegally in the city 's parks , the game has now made its breakthrough as an official sport .
this summer it won an award at the international sports fair in munich .
" its like a virus , " creator thomas von klier says .
" and its spreading fast . "
faster and lighter it all began on a boat .
sailor and passionate badminton player bill brandes was fed up of playing such a slow , wind dependant game and wanted something to be able to play on the deck of a ship .
more than seven years later , brandes had developed a shuttlecock which was by far faster and lighter than the usual badminton shuttle .
together with a group of friends , brandes founded a small firm and in the following years designed and developed special racquets and thought up simple rules for those who prefer a proper match .
for the winter , co-creator von klier and his colleagues developed an indoor version using half a tennis court - making it playable throughout the year .
" its like a drug , " von klier says .
" once you get hooked , you just ca n't stop . "
from coburg to cairo von klier has played speedminton all over the world .
whether on the marketplace in quedlinburg or in the deserts of egypt , the lighting expert always takes his set of racquets and balls with him .
while film makers and actors whiled the time away in endlessly long shooting breaks , von klier would make the most of any welcome intermission and play - in the most unusual of venues .
a pastime which soon attracted others on the film set : " very often during shoots a real speedminton craze broke out .
and everyone wanted to take the game back home . "
there are around 6,000 active speedminton players in germany .
the german badminton community may comprise of more than 150,000 , but speedminton will soon catch up , inventor brandes forecasts .
" badminton is an old tradition in germany .
but for young people it is just too boring . "

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .
he and schröder have planned talks for saturday morning where they will discuss various eu issues , including a september trip to new york to address the un general assembly . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares over german role in iraq germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .

commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .

" rising from the ruins and turning toward the future , " it began .
now it 's only the first line of a defunct national anthem that symbolized the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- for 40 years .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , communist east germany ceased to exist and the soul-searching began .
victims , perpetrators , historians and politicians re-evaluated their experiences in the second dictatorship on german territory , rewrote history .
many east and west germans wanted nothing more than to forget the former state that disappeared 14 years ago .
now however the gdr is making a comeback , albeit in a softer light .
as east german products and lifestyles become " cool " and " fashionable " , the surge of nostalgia for a lost world even has a new nickname - ostalgie - a play on the german words for east -lrb- o st -rrb- and " nostalgia " -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- . the focus is on " normal , " everyday life in the communist east minus the oppressiveness imposed by a totalitarian regime .
after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .

the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , dieter althaus , has warned that reviews of the gdr must reflect reality instead of being nostalgic .
leipzig media expert hans-jörg stiehler has said the new ostalgie supplants political discussion of the gdr legacy .
psychotherapist hans-joachim maaz has claimed the trend is superficial and that it should n't be allowed to play down the inhumane sides of the system .
the broadcasters , accused of trying to cash in on ostalgie , disagreed .

the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "
around 37 percent thought negative aspects of the gdr should also be shown , and 38 percent said it was fine to be reminded exclusively of the positive features of the east german state .

a wave of television revival shows on life in former communist east germany have hit the airwaves in germany .
critics fear they play down the repressive reality of the system . the song was a positive one , forward-looking .
" rising from the ruins and turning toward the future , " it began .
now it 's only the first line of a defunct national anthem that symbolized the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- for 40 years .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , communist east germany ceased to exist and the soul-searching began .
victims , perpetrators , historians and politicians re-evaluated their experiences in the second dictatorship on german territory , rewrote history .
many east and west germans wanted nothing more than to forget the former state that disappeared 14 years ago .
now however the gdr is making a comeback , albeit in a softer light .
as east german products and lifestyles become " cool " and " fashionable " , the surge of nostalgia for a lost world even has a new nickname - ostalgie - a play on the german words for east -lrb- o st -rrb- and " nostalgia " -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- . the focus is on " normal , " everyday life in the communist east minus the oppressiveness imposed by a totalitarian regime .
after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .
zdf , mdr and sat.1 began airing their retrospectives of everyday life in the gdr over the past ten days .
this week the rtl version is set to take off .
distorting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but critics are concerned that the new ostalgie wave distorts the past and plays down the unjustness of the east german state .
the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , dieter althaus , has warned that reviews of the gdr must reflect reality instead of being nostalgic .
leipzig media expert hans-jörg stiehler has said the new ostalgie supplants political discussion of the gdr legacy .
psychotherapist hans-joachim maaz has claimed the trend is superficial and that it should n't be allowed to play down the inhumane sides of the system .
the broadcasters , accused of trying to cash in on ostalgie , disagreed .
the show was n't supposed to deal with the political gdr , rather it was meant to show different facets of life in the gdr .
" for the east german , the program affords reminiscences , the west german receives whole new insights , " is how sat.1 spokeswoman jutta kehrer explained ostalgie .
the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .

" well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .

the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .
the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "
around 37 percent thought negative aspects of the gdr should also be shown , and 38 percent said it was fine to be reminded exclusively of the positive features of the east german state .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence .
-lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- reform wing loses in union power struggle the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .
his departure marks a defeat for modernists at europe 's largest industrial union .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence .

“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .

" well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .
he lacks charisma and support from the people .
the paper wrote he was only put in his position because of american and israeli pressure .
it noted his political career could possibly be saved if he honestly made a move to stop the militant groups hamas and islamic jihad .
but , the paper concluded , in order for him and the peace plan to succeed , he needs more help than a friendly invitation from washington . germany ’ s frankfurter rundschau commented on iraq ’ s dilemma .
since the end of major combats in may , there have been many coalition casualties .
last week un headquarters was bombed where un top envoy sergio de mello and 19 colleagues were killed , and recently three british soldiers were killed in basra .
it ’ s become a guessing game to figure out who is carrying out the attacks – saddam loyalists , al-qaeda ... the paper said anything is possible and such terrorism is exactly what u.s. president bush wanted to avoid with his regime change in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .
he and schröder have planned talks for saturday morning where they will discuss various eu issues , including a september trip to new york to address the un general assembly . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares over german role in iraq germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.08.2003 more turmoil on the horizon for ig metall ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peters and huber 's leadership partnership could be under threat with its power struggles and failed strikes barely behind it , germany 's metalworkers and engineering union threatens to spiral into crisis as a wrench is thrown into its upcoming election . just a week before leaders of the ig metall trade union are due to meet to approve its new leadership team , the organization finds itself in yet another dilemma .
the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence .

created in berlin , the sport is now catching on all over the world . it 's summer in berlin , temperatures are rising and with it the desire to be out in the park and to relax in the fresh air .
barbeques are forbidden , picnics are boring , " speeding , " however is not - according to a growing number of young berliners .
officially called " speedminton , " the game - a mixture of tennis , squash and badminton - is the summer activity in the city .
played until recently , in typical berlin manner illegally in the city 's parks , the game has now made its breakthrough as an official sport .
this summer it won an award at the international sports fair in munich .
" its like a virus , " creator thomas von klier says .
" and its spreading fast . "
faster and lighter it all began on a boat .
sailor and passionate badminton player bill brandes was fed up of playing such a slow , wind dependant game and wanted something to be able to play on the deck of a ship .
more than seven years later , brandes had developed a shuttlecock which was by far faster and lighter than the usual badminton shuttle .
together with a group of friends , brandes founded a small firm and in the following years designed and developed special racquets and thought up simple rules for those who prefer a proper match .
for the winter , co-creator von klier and his colleagues developed an indoor version using half a tennis court - making it playable throughout the year .
" its like a drug , " von klier says .
" once you get hooked , you just ca n't stop . "
from coburg to cairo von klier has played speedminton all over the world .
whether on the marketplace in quedlinburg or in the deserts of egypt , the lighting expert always takes his set of racquets and balls with him .
while film makers and actors whiled the time away in endlessly long shooting breaks , von klier would make the most of any welcome intermission and play - in the most unusual of venues .
a pastime which soon attracted others on the film set : " very often during shoots a real speedminton craze broke out .
and everyone wanted to take the game back home . "
there are around 6,000 active speedminton players in germany .
the german badminton community may comprise of more than 150,000 , but speedminton will soon catch up , inventor brandes forecasts .
" badminton is an old tradition in germany .
but for young people it is just too boring . "
active at night boredom is an unknown word among die-hard " speeders . "
their logo is a lizard : " lizards are fast , agile and in particular - active at night . "
so are speedminton players : when dusk falls over berlin 's tall town houses and first lights in dark apartments go on , speedminton players get ready for a long , colorful night .
players decorate bare arms and legs with fluorescent paint , black lights are set up and techno beats make loudspeakers vibrate .
on these nights " speedminton " becomes " blackminton " and players - using luminous shuttlecocks - play until deep into the night .
sometimes strange things happen during these nightly outings .

created in berlin , the sport is now catching on all over the world . it 's summer in berlin , temperatures are rising and with it the desire to be out in the park and to relax in the fresh air .
barbeques are forbidden , picnics are boring , " speeding , " however is not - according to a growing number of young berliners .
officially called " speedminton , " the game - a mixture of tennis , squash and badminton - is the summer activity in the city .
played until recently , in typical berlin manner illegally in the city 's parks , the game has now made its breakthrough as an official sport .
this summer it won an award at the international sports fair in munich .
" its like a virus , " creator thomas von klier says .
" and its spreading fast . "
faster and lighter it all began on a boat .
sailor and passionate badminton player bill brandes was fed up of playing such a slow , wind dependant game and wanted something to be able to play on the deck of a ship .
more than seven years later , brandes had developed a shuttlecock which was by far faster and lighter than the usual badminton shuttle .
together with a group of friends , brandes founded a small firm and in the following years designed and developed special racquets and thought up simple rules for those who prefer a proper match .
for the winter , co-creator von klier and his colleagues developed an indoor version using half a tennis court - making it playable throughout the year .
" its like a drug , " von klier says .
" once you get hooked , you just ca n't stop . "
from coburg to cairo von klier has played speedminton all over the world .
whether on the marketplace in quedlinburg or in the deserts of egypt , the lighting expert always takes his set of racquets and balls with him .
while film makers and actors whiled the time away in endlessly long shooting breaks , von klier would make the most of any welcome intermission and play - in the most unusual of venues .
a pastime which soon attracted others on the film set : " very often during shoots a real speedminton craze broke out .
and everyone wanted to take the game back home . "
there are around 6,000 active speedminton players in germany .
the german badminton community may comprise of more than 150,000 , but speedminton will soon catch up , inventor brandes forecasts .
" badminton is an old tradition in germany .
but for young people it is just too boring . "
active at night boredom is an unknown word among die-hard " speeders . "
their logo is a lizard : " lizards are fast , agile and in particular - active at night . "
so are speedminton players : when dusk falls over berlin 's tall town houses and first lights in dark apartments go on , speedminton players get ready for a long , colorful night .
players decorate bare arms and legs with fluorescent paint , black lights are set up and techno beats make loudspeakers vibrate .
on these nights " speedminton " becomes " blackminton " and players - using luminous shuttlecocks - play until deep into the night .
sometimes strange things happen during these nightly outings .
one evening , von klier 's shuttlecocks kept on changing course .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .

the country ’ s largest industrial trade union has only recently steadied itself after a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and the subsequent bitter in-fighting that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
now , jürgen peters , the incumbent leader of ig metall , may face an unexpected challenge for the top seat which could once again throw the trade union into chaos . uwe hück , the head of the works council for porsche ag , has indicated he will enter a challenge for the leadership of ig metall if he can find sufficient backing .
“ if i get enough support for the candidacy then i ’ ll step in , ” hück said before adding that he expects to make a formal decision by wednesday . hück dreads peters leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strike !
when pushed on his views of an ig metall under the complete control of peters and his supporters , hück told the german newspaper die welt , “ i dread the chaos . ” peters and his camp of followers want to install as many supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board , something that has prompted the man from porsche to consider action . hück ’ s announcement has taken the trade union by surprise .
his intention to run as an opposition candidate to peters had not been discussed with his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , according to spokesman frank stoh .
huber , the second half of the leadership duo pencilled into power after the collapse of zwickel ’ s leadership and a man of considerable power in the industry , is reportedly less than happy at the way hück has handled his tentative first steps into a leadership battle that was by all intents and purposes over . appointment to end feud the meeting at the end of august was supposed to finally bring about the end of the internal struggles that threatened to rip the union apart and install a leadership team that would steady the ig metall ship until 2007 .
the selection of peters the hardliner and huber the modernizer was seen as a compromise settlement after the damaging leadership crisis and the union ’ s worst postwar split , brought on by failed strikes to implement a 35-hour work week in eastern germany in june . hück ’ s decision to even consider running at a point so close to the election threatens to create further problems for the union , which has suffered diminished political influence and waning membership in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berthold huber and jürgen peters .
although the interim appointment of huber and peters -lrb- pictured -rrb- was welcomed at the time , an alternative leadership candidate may well appeal to many of the 2.6 million engineering and auto workers the union represents , particularly those in eastern germany .
before the announcement in july , union members from automaker opel handed over a petition with 4,000 signatures rejecting the leadership choice and calling for new faces at the top .
members have been leaving the organization in droves - a result of soaring unemployment as well as concern the union has lost its way amid germany ’ s major economic reform drive . out of economic step the aborted strike action over the reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 38 prompted many to believe that ig metall had attempted to block the modernization efforts of the center-left government of chancellor gerhard schröder , whose social democrats have traditionally had strong ties to trade unions , and was becoming increasingly out of step with the economic needs of the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peters expected to lead ig metall jürgen peters will now likely replace klaus zwickel as head of the crisis-ridden engineering union ig metall .
but critics say the new leadership may not be enough to reverse the union 's waning influence .
-lrb- july 23 , 2003 -rrb- reform wing loses in union power struggle the head of ig metall has resigned after a bitter power struggle with his deputy in the wake of a failed strike in eastern germany .
his departure marks a defeat for modernists at europe 's largest industrial union .
-lrb- july 21 , 2003 -rrb- strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s once mighty engineering union ig metall is facing a leadership crisis , after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country last month .

created in berlin , the sport is now catching on all over the world . it 's summer in berlin , temperatures are rising and with it the desire to be out in the park and to relax in the fresh air .
barbeques are forbidden , picnics are boring , " speeding , " however is not - according to a growing number of young berliners .
officially called " speedminton , " the game - a mixture of tennis , squash and badminton - is the summer activity in the city .
played until recently , in typical berlin manner illegally in the city 's parks , the game has now made its breakthrough as an official sport .
this summer it won an award at the international sports fair in munich .
" its like a virus , " creator thomas von klier says .
" and its spreading fast . "
faster and lighter it all began on a boat .
sailor and passionate badminton player bill brandes was fed up of playing such a slow , wind dependant game and wanted something to be able to play on the deck of a ship .
more than seven years later , brandes had developed a shuttlecock which was by far faster and lighter than the usual badminton shuttle .
together with a group of friends , brandes founded a small firm and in the following years designed and developed special racquets and thought up simple rules for those who prefer a proper match .
for the winter , co-creator von klier and his colleagues developed an indoor version using half a tennis court - making it playable throughout the year .
" its like a drug , " von klier says .
" once you get hooked , you just ca n't stop . "
from coburg to cairo von klier has played speedminton all over the world .
whether on the marketplace in quedlinburg or in the deserts of egypt , the lighting expert always takes his set of racquets and balls with him .
while film makers and actors whiled the time away in endlessly long shooting breaks , von klier would make the most of any welcome intermission and play - in the most unusual of venues .
a pastime which soon attracted others on the film set : " very often during shoots a real speedminton craze broke out .
and everyone wanted to take the game back home . "
there are around 6,000 active speedminton players in germany .
the german badminton community may comprise of more than 150,000 , but speedminton will soon catch up , inventor brandes forecasts .
" badminton is an old tradition in germany .
but for young people it is just too boring . "
active at night boredom is an unknown word among die-hard " speeders . "
their logo is a lizard : " lizards are fast , agile and in particular - active at night . "
so are speedminton players : when dusk falls over berlin 's tall town houses and first lights in dark apartments go on , speedminton players get ready for a long , colorful night .
players decorate bare arms and legs with fluorescent paint , black lights are set up and techno beats make loudspeakers vibrate .
on these nights " speedminton " becomes " blackminton " and players - using luminous shuttlecocks - play until deep into the night .
sometimes strange things happen during these nightly outings .
one evening , von klier 's shuttlecocks kept on changing course .
" at first i thought i had drunk too much , " he says , with a laugh .
" but it was just confused bats . " louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links speedminton.com 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "

a wave of television revival shows on life in former communist east germany have hit the airwaves in germany .
critics fear they play down the repressive reality of the system . the song was a positive one , forward-looking .
" rising from the ruins and turning toward the future , " it began .
now it 's only the first line of a defunct national anthem that symbolized the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- for 40 years .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , communist east germany ceased to exist and the soul-searching began .
victims , perpetrators , historians and politicians re-evaluated their experiences in the second dictatorship on german territory , rewrote history .
many east and west germans wanted nothing more than to forget the former state that disappeared 14 years ago .
now however the gdr is making a comeback , albeit in a softer light .
as east german products and lifestyles become " cool " and " fashionable " , the surge of nostalgia for a lost world even has a new nickname - ostalgie - a play on the german words for east -lrb- o st -rrb- and " nostalgia " -lrb- nostalgie -rrb- . the focus is on " normal , " everyday life in the communist east minus the oppressiveness imposed by a totalitarian regime .
after the surprising box-office success of the german film " good bye , lenin " earlier this year - which centered around a young man 's clownish attempts to recreate an ersatz east germany after the fall of the berlin wall for his fragile mother , who lies in a coma during reunification - no less than four german television broadcasters have jumped on to the ostalgie -bandwagon .
zdf , mdr and sat.1 began airing their retrospectives of everyday life in the gdr over the past ten days .
this week the rtl version is set to take off .
distorting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but critics are concerned that the new ostalgie wave distorts the past and plays down the unjustness of the east german state .
the premier of the eastern state of thuringia , dieter althaus , has warned that reviews of the gdr must reflect reality instead of being nostalgic .
leipzig media expert hans-jörg stiehler has said the new ostalgie supplants political discussion of the gdr legacy .
psychotherapist hans-joachim maaz has claimed the trend is superficial and that it should n't be allowed to play down the inhumane sides of the system .
the broadcasters , accused of trying to cash in on ostalgie , disagreed .
the show was n't supposed to deal with the political gdr , rather it was meant to show different facets of life in the gdr .
" for the east german , the program affords reminiscences , the west german receives whole new insights , " is how sat.1 spokeswoman jutta kehrer explained ostalgie .
the shows usually feature interviews and talks with famous dissidents and actors from east germany as well as politicians and sport figures .
the upcoming one on the rtl station will be hosted by 37-year-old olympic skating star and an icon of the east , katherine witt , known in germany as the " beautiful face of socialism . "
most germans though are skeptical of the new shows .
a survey released on friday by the polling institute emnid revealed that 59 percent of germans think the programs show the gdr in the wrong light , of which 22 percent said " an unjust state like the gdr is not an appropriate topic for a light program . "

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .

monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa – including elections in rwanda – as well as trouble spots in the middle east . the belgium paper , le soir on monday looked at rwanda ’ s first presidential vote since the 1994 genocide that killed up to one million people .
rwandan voters have to place their thumb print on the picture and name of their candidate , a common method in countries with high illiteracy rates .
but , the paper noted , many of the rural farmers are afraid to leave their ‘ signature ’ for fear that city people will find out if they voted ‘ wrongly . ’ britain ’ s financial times commented on the united nation ’ s peace-keeping role in africa .
despite the demand , the paper opined that international intervention in west and central africa has been painfully slow , largely because the united states has been reluctant to set an example .
the paper also said the un deployment in congo was a traumatic experience , and since then africa as a whole has proven a difficult terrain for peace missions .
the paper accused the un of leaving a trail of failures behind because in part of it ’ s ‘ past dismal record in the most marginalized of continents . ’ moscow ’ s kommersant said much of palestine ’ s violence and controversy has a lot to do with the disputed roles of politicians who want peace and those who push for conflict .
under international pressure , yasser arafat appointed mahmoud abbas to prime minister which many think is a good choice .
but the paper argued , abbas can hardly be called a liberal , peace-willing politician .
abbas and his security minister are only acting against terrorist groups because of pressure from the united states and israel .
the paper said this image change within the palestinian government is just another one of yasser arafat ’ s tactics . copenhagen ’ s information said palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas is being left alone with too much responsibility .
he lacks charisma and support from the people .
the paper wrote he was only put in his position because of american and israeli pressure .
it noted his political career could possibly be saved if he honestly made a move to stop the militant groups hamas and islamic jihad .
but , the paper concluded , in order for him and the peace plan to succeed , he needs more help than a friendly invitation from washington . germany ’ s frankfurter rundschau commented on iraq ’ s dilemma .
since the end of major combats in may , there have been many coalition casualties .
last week un headquarters was bombed where un top envoy sergio de mello and 19 colleagues were killed , and recently three british soldiers were killed in basra .
it ’ s become a guessing game to figure out who is carrying out the attacks – saddam loyalists , al-qaeda ... the paper said anything is possible and such terrorism is exactly what u.s. president bush wanted to avoid with his regime change in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .
he and schröder have planned talks for saturday morning where they will discuss various eu issues , including a september trip to new york to address the un general assembly . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares over german role in iraq germany continues to rule out taking a peacekeeping role in iraq for the moment , but comments by defense minister peter struck have sparked a debate over a possible german participation under nato and un auspices .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .

" well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .

thousands german youths descended on the baltic island of rügen this weekend for the prora03 festival .
despite the location 's controversial past , organizers hope the event will raise the spirits of the depressed region . as politicians from the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania considered ways of helping the youth in a region wracked by unemployment , they came up with the idea of staging a youth festival , a kind of awareness weekend along a beautiful stretch of the baltic coast . successfully bringing together 15,000 young germans with some of the country ’ s top politicians , prora03 – the largest national youth event in germany – aimed to paint a brighter future for the state , where many youths leave as soon as they can because there is little work to be had . but the past also played a big role at the three-day festival , especially since it took place underneath the backdrop of one the most fascinating – if somewhat controversial – architectural sites the region has to offer .
for prora is a massive , yet never completed nazi seaside holiday complex . the location of prora had event organizers divided for a while , with one camp arguing the impossibility of using such sullied terrain for youth purposes , and the other countering decisively that the very presence of new generations would drive out the demons of the past .
the second camp won , and the festival took place this weekend with much music , entertainment and political discussion . high-profile politicians , including christian democrats leader angela merkel came to the festival to speak to and with germany 's youngsters , and german president johannes rau called on those present to become politically active .
he said that only those who get involved actually have the power to change things .
they were select words given the location of the festival and the distance that germany has come since prora 's shady beginnings . a nazi vision prora dates back to nazi times .
shortly after hitler and his national socialists came to power in 1933 , the trade unions were dissolved , and replaced with a newly-founded organization called the deutsche arbeitsfront -lrb- daf -rrb- , which was designed as a unified organization of the national socialist community . the daf was run by one of hitler 's confidants , dr. robert ley , who set up a leisure-time organization called " kraft durch freude " -lrb- kdf -rrb- or strength through joy .
the idea was to organize mass group holidays , to offer germans a chance to recooperate at least once a year so as to maximize their health and keep happy under nazi rule and fit for the coming war . in the summer of 1938 , ley was quoted as saying , " everything , but everything which we are doing with our kraft durch freude holidays , serves one single purpose ; to give our people the strength to solve the burning issue of our inadequate landmass .
we 're not traveling about for fun , i deny that i created a travel organization .
they should become sturdy so that when the führer calls on them to solve this last issue , they will stand before him , 80 million-strong . " well-laid plans ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1935 , the kdf organization announced huge-scale plans to built five seaside resorts along the german coastline .
the first – and last – was earmarked for the island of rügen .
the idea came directly from the führer , who was not thinking only in terms of the vacation delights of working germans , but of the war he was planning .
he ordered that the resort at prora should be larger than anything of its sort , with 20,000 beds , which could , in the event of war , be used as a military hospital . the architectural contract went to the cologne architect , clemens klotz , who had already proved his worth in nazi circles .
his designs were presented at the 1937 world exhibition in paris , where they were awarded the grand prix .
eight resort buildings , each half a kilometer in length , were to dominate the beautiful coastline .
and in amongst it all , there was to be a huge central ' festivities ' house for all 20,000 ' holiday-makers ' , a wave pool , a quay complex where cruise ships could dock , a power station , water works , a hospital and schools . unfinished business work began on the massive construction project at the beginning of may 1936 , and just short of two years later , the initial phase was complete .
nine construction companies were racing against each other , and with war looming , against the clock , to complete the eight accommodation blocks and the quay complex .
the first of the blocks was completed towards the end of 1938 , and although the shells were erected before the outbreak of war , 1939 put a rapid end to the ambitious building project . with the soviet occupation of eastern germany in 1945 , prora 's fate took an unexpected turn .
the accommodation block shells became a temporary point of refuge for german citizens expelled from their homelands after the end of the war .
in 1948 the southern most block was exploded by soviet forces , and the building materials were taken away .
subsequent attempts to destroy two other housing blocks succeeded only in damaging them , and creating the ghostly ruins which still tower at the waterfront today . looking ahead with five of the original eight accommodation blocks still in a useable state , an architectural competition has been launched to transform block five into a youth hostel .
organizers of prora03 hope the rebirth of the complex will also ignite the imagination of the mecklenburg-western pomerania ’ s youth and convince them to stick around and help secure the region ’ s future while not forgetting the past . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de expulsion not just a german issue plans to build a center in berlin to remember europeans expelled from their homelands in the 20th century have been shot down by the german government .
reading from hitler ’ s “ mein kampf ” provokes furor a planned reading from hitler ’ s autobiography " mein kampf " has sparked much debate in the eastern german state of mecklenburg-west pomerania .
hitler 's unrealized dream in poland as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .
sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .
estimates are the soldiers will be posted there for some time to come .
according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .
although berlin promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid to iraq after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .
and i think that it ’ s fair to say that without our commitment , there would be less security and stability in and around kabul .
now , it ’ s of course important to export this security level in the capital to other regions in afghanistan . he said germany has a fact-finding delegation currently in the kundus region to see whether it is feasible to send a german provincial reconstruction team there in future to be protected by bundeswehr soldiers . “ it ’ s too early to speculate whether this will materialize .
but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .
the two discussed the current tense transatlantic relationship and lugar encouraged germany to rethink its “ no ” to military involvement in iraq , although he did not meet with much success . “ we will have to learn to live that , if that ’ s the germans ’ final decision , ” the republican from the state of indiana said . patching things up in italy friday evening , schröder traveled to verona , italy to meet european commission president romani prodi and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi – their first encounter since a series of diplomatic spats this summer between germany and italy prompted schröder to cancel his planned holiday in italy and stay in his home town , hanover , instead . a scheduled date between schröder and berlusconi at a performance of the opera “ carmen ” did not happen after the italian leader cancelled at the last minute , citing concerns that left-wing protests could ruin the evening .

created in berlin , the sport is now catching on all over the world . it 's summer in berlin , temperatures are rising and with it the desire to be out in the park and to relax in the fresh air .
barbeques are forbidden , picnics are boring , " speeding , " however is not - according to a growing number of young berliners .
officially called " speedminton , " the game - a mixture of tennis , squash and badminton - is the summer activity in the city .
played until recently , in typical berlin manner illegally in the city 's parks , the game has now made its breakthrough as an official sport .
this summer it won an award at the international sports fair in munich .
" its like a virus , " creator thomas von klier says .
" and its spreading fast . "
faster and lighter it all began on a boat .
sailor and passionate badminton player bill brandes was fed up of playing such a slow , wind dependant game and wanted something to be able to play on the deck of a ship .
more than seven years later , brandes had developed a shuttlecock which was by far faster and lighter than the usual badminton shuttle .
together with a group of friends , brandes founded a small firm and in the following years designed and developed special racquets and thought up simple rules for those who prefer a proper match .
for the winter , co-creator von klier and his colleagues developed an indoor version using half a tennis court - making it playable throughout the year .
" its like a drug , " von klier says .
" once you get hooked , you just ca n't stop . "
from coburg to cairo von klier has played speedminton all over the world .
whether on the marketplace in quedlinburg or in the deserts of egypt , the lighting expert always takes his set of racquets and balls with him .
while film makers and actors whiled the time away in endlessly long shooting breaks , von klier would make the most of any welcome intermission and play - in the most unusual of venues .
a pastime which soon attracted others on the film set : " very often during shoots a real speedminton craze broke out .
and everyone wanted to take the game back home . "
there are around 6,000 active speedminton players in germany .
the german badminton community may comprise of more than 150,000 , but speedminton will soon catch up , inventor brandes forecasts .
" badminton is an old tradition in germany .
but for young people it is just too boring . "
active at night boredom is an unknown word among die-hard " speeders . "
their logo is a lizard : " lizards are fast , agile and in particular - active at night . "
so are speedminton players : when dusk falls over berlin 's tall town houses and first lights in dark apartments go on , speedminton players get ready for a long , colorful night .
players decorate bare arms and legs with fluorescent paint , black lights are set up and techno beats make loudspeakers vibrate .
on these nights " speedminton " becomes " blackminton " and players - using luminous shuttlecocks - play until deep into the night .
sometimes strange things happen during these nightly outings .
one evening , von klier 's shuttlecocks kept on changing course .
" at first i thought i had drunk too much , " he says , with a laugh .
" but it was just confused bats . " louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links speedminton.com 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

in an interview with dw-tv , german chancellor gerhard schröder confirms germany ’ s commitment to fight terrorism and work toward stability in afghanistan .
but he says there are no plans to send german soldiers to iraq . after tuesday ’ s attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad which killed 24 people , the german government came under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude toward military involvement in iraq .
however , in an interview conducted on the lawn of the chancellery in central berlin , gerhard schröder reiterated that no german soldiers will be going to iraq . “ there are no concrete requests vis-à-vis the german government to send soldiers to iraq , neither by the coalition forces , nor by the united nations , ” the chancellor said .
“ this is why there ’ s simply no need to enter into such a theoretical debate at present .
you also have to see that our capacities are limited . ” at present german troops are involved in large-scale operations in afghanistan , the balkans and the horn of africa .

according to officials in the bundeswehr , or german federal armed forces , the military is already stretched to the limit . “ let ’ s not forget that in germany itself we have some 3,000 soldiers protecting various bases , installations and other objects belonging to the united states and britain .
so , nobody can accuse germany of doing too little in the fight against terrorism , ” schröder told deutsche welle .
while germany ’ s military might not have the strength to go into iraq , there is little desire among german politicians and military officials to enter into a situation on the ground in iraq which seems to be deteriorating .
there are also objections on principle .

commitment to afghanistan addressing the situation in afghanistan , chancellor schroeder said it had become increasingly obvious that more has to be done on the ground to support the caretaker government of hamid karsai .
germany , he added , was in principle prepared to go the extra mile and contribute to reconstruction teams in the provinces , which are still largely controlled by warlords and considered extremely dangerous . “ i ’ d like to stress that germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan has been substantial .

but if conditions turn out to be okay , me might be sending between 50 and 300 people to kundus , ” the chancellor said . on friday , chancellor schroeder had talks in berlin with richard lugar , a key u.s. senate republican and chairman of the foreign relations committee .
lugar has come out in favor of a new un resolution on iraq to help secure greater international support in peace-keeping efforts by the coalition forces .

created in berlin , the sport is now catching on all over the world . it 's summer in berlin , temperatures are rising and with it the desire to be out in the park and to relax in the fresh air .
barbeques are forbidden , picnics are boring , " speeding , " however is not - according to a growing number of young berliners .
officially called " speedminton , " the game - a mixture of tennis , squash and badminton - is the summer activity in the city .
played until recently , in typical berlin manner illegally in the city 's parks , the game has now made its breakthrough as an official sport .
this summer it won an award at the international sports fair in munich .
" its like a virus , " creator thomas von klier says .
" and its spreading fast . "
faster and lighter it all began on a boat .
sailor and passionate badminton player bill brandes was fed up of playing such a slow , wind dependant game and wanted something to be able to play on the deck of a ship .
more than seven years later , brandes had developed a shuttlecock which was by far faster and lighter than the usual badminton shuttle .
together with a group of friends , brandes founded a small firm and in the following years designed and developed special racquets and thought up simple rules for those who prefer a proper match .
for the winter , co-creator von klier and his colleagues developed an indoor version using half a tennis court - making it playable throughout the year .
" its like a drug , " von klier says .
" once you get hooked , you just ca n't stop . "
from coburg to cairo von klier has played speedminton all over the world .
whether on the marketplace in quedlinburg or in the deserts of egypt , the lighting expert always takes his set of racquets and balls with him .
while film makers and actors whiled the time away in endlessly long shooting breaks , von klier would make the most of any welcome intermission and play - in the most unusual of venues .
a pastime which soon attracted others on the film set : " very often during shoots a real speedminton craze broke out .
and everyone wanted to take the game back home . "
there are around 6,000 active speedminton players in germany .
the german badminton community may comprise of more than 150,000 , but speedminton will soon catch up , inventor brandes forecasts .
" badminton is an old tradition in germany .
but for young people it is just too boring . "
active at night boredom is an unknown word among die-hard " speeders . "
their logo is a lizard : " lizards are fast , agile and in particular - active at night . "
so are speedminton players : when dusk falls over berlin 's tall town houses and first lights in dark apartments go on , speedminton players get ready for a long , colorful night .
players decorate bare arms and legs with fluorescent paint , black lights are set up and techno beats make loudspeakers vibrate .
on these nights " speedminton " becomes " blackminton " and players - using luminous shuttlecocks - play until deep into the night .
sometimes strange things happen during these nightly outings .
one evening , von klier 's shuttlecocks kept on changing course .

mike may , of california , had been blind for 40 years since an accident at the age of three where he lost one eye and was blinded in the other .
during that time he had some ability to perceive light , but could not make out form or contrast .
he said he had no visual memories from his early childhood .
the difference between today and over two years ago is that i can better guess what i am seeing the patient the operation transplanted corneal and limbal stem cells into his right eye .
the cornea is the clear part of the outer layer of the eye that covers the iris and the pupil .
the limbus is the thin area that connects the cornea and the sclera , the white part of the eye .
shapes researchers followed his recovery in order to study how mr may learned to see again .
they measured areas such as how he perceived shapes , his spatial awareness and how he saw 3d images .
when he was tested five months after surgery , the patient was able to perceive slight movements of a bar and was able to recognise simple shapes .
two years after the surgery , mr may was able to see form , colour and motion almost normally .
however , his 3d perception and face and object recognition was still severely impaired .
mr may could only identify around a quarter of common objects shown to him .
and he was also only able to tell if an unfamiliar face was male or female 70 % of the time .
his perception of motion was found to be the most well-preserved visual faculty .
frightened but mr may was not fully comfortable with his newly gained sight .
before the operation he had been a keen skier , using verbal directions as a guide .
but after he recovered his sight , he was frightened he would crash into something .
over two years , he has learnt to use shading patterns on the snow to estimate the shape of the slope .
mr may is also nervous of crossing the road , where he was confident of doing so while blind .
he said : " the difference between today and over two years ago is that i can better guess what i am seeing .
what is the same is that i am still guessing . "
the details of mr may 's case are published in the journal nature neuroscience .

eight out of 10 drivers are confused about the alcohol content of drinks and do not understand " how much is too much " , motoring organisation the rac said .
among the seven million people happy to drive after drinking beer , wine or spirits , the majority consume double the number of alcohol units they think they have , the survey of 800 people claimed .
the rac said the problem had been made worse by the introduction of new drinks and called on the government and manufacturers to improve awareness of just how strong they are .

many pubs now serve double measures of spirits as standard and wine can no longer be bought in measures equivalent to one unit of alcohol following the decline of 8 % strength brands .
one standard glass of wine these days is actually equivalent to two units , the rac explained .
' outdated information ' the legal drink-drive limit is 80mg per 100 millilitres of blood , but this can not easily be translated into alcohol units as it can be affected by build , sex , whether food has been eaten , and a host of other factors .

she said the idea that you could work out how much you can safely drink without going over the limit was simply not true .
" it 's really best to never drink any alcohol before driving because you simply ca n't tell how much you 've had to drink and what sort of effect it will have on you , " she added .

eight out of 10 drivers are confused about the alcohol content of drinks and do not understand " how much is too much " , motoring organisation the rac said .
among the seven million people happy to drive after drinking beer , wine or spirits , the majority consume double the number of alcohol units they think they have , the survey of 800 people claimed .
the rac said the problem had been made worse by the introduction of new drinks and called on the government and manufacturers to improve awareness of just how strong they are .

many pubs now serve double measures of spirits as standard and wine can no longer be bought in measures equivalent to one unit of alcohol following the decline of 8 % strength brands .

she said the idea that you could work out how much you can safely drink without going over the limit was simply not true .
" it 's really best to never drink any alcohol before driving because you simply ca n't tell how much you 've had to drink and what sort of effect it will have on you , " she added .

alcohol content standard -lrb- 175ml -rrb- glass of wine - 2 units large -lrb- 250ml -rrb- glass of wine - 3 units pint of standard lager - 2.3 units pint of premium lager - 2.8 units pint of strong cider - 4.7 units it said the market has been flooded with more types of drink than ever before , with the fashion for premium strength lagers just part of the problem .
many pubs now serve double measures of spirits as standard and wine can no longer be bought in measures equivalent to one unit of alcohol following the decline of 8 % strength brands .
one standard glass of wine these days is actually equivalent to two units , the rac explained .
' outdated information ' the legal drink-drive limit is 80mg per 100 millilitres of blood , but this can not easily be translated into alcohol units as it can be affected by build , sex , whether food has been eaten , and a host of other factors .
drink-drive facts 34 % of men drink and drive , compared with 23 % of women those aged 35-54 are least likely to drink and drive those in the higher social grades -lrb- abc1 -rrb- are slightly more likely to drink before driving rac spokeswoman nicola thunhurst told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " people really do n't have an awareness of the number of alcoholic units that are in the drinks they are consuming and they 're actually basing their knowledge on quite out of date information . "
she said the idea that you could work out how much you can safely drink without going over the limit was simply not true .
" it 's really best to never drink any alcohol before driving because you simply ca n't tell how much you 've had to drink and what sort of effect it will have on you , " she added .
the rac says millions of motorists regularly - and unwittingly - drink more than they realise before getting into their cars .
it said the government must " increase public awareness of alcohol units and work with the drinks trade to improve the labelling on alcohol " .

crucial consultations about the scheme with representatives of the local community are to take place over the coming weeks .
the reef , which could cost up to £ 6m , is being proposed at tolcarne beach , newquay bay , on the north cornwall coast .
fistral beach at newquay is already one of europe 's top wave riding spots , but the new reef could provide world class waves .
that is according to a feasibility study carried out for the newquay artificial reef company by marine consultants .
surfer and civil engineer anthony weight , who initiated the scheme , said forthcoming meetings with members of the local community were " very important " to the progress of the project .
fistral beach is already a top surfing spot mr weight said they would choose whether or not to back the scheme which , he said , could provide more jobs and wealth for cornwall .
risk management and traffic impact assessments would also have to be carried out in connection with the project .
the reef would be built from giant , sand-filled textile bags , with surf breaks ranking alongside international breaks in australia , new zealand and south africa , according to the feasibility study .
the twin-armed , arrow-shaped reef would create 200-metre long surfing rides on each " arm " .
quality conditions quality surfing conditions were likely to occur on 106 days a year with the new reef , said the study .

crucial consultations about the scheme with representatives of the local community are to take place over the coming weeks .
the reef , which could cost up to £ 6m , is being proposed at tolcarne beach , newquay bay , on the north cornwall coast .
fistral beach at newquay is already one of europe 's top wave riding spots , but the new reef could provide world class waves .

surfer and civil engineer anthony weight , who initiated the scheme , said forthcoming meetings with members of the local community were " very important " to the progress of the project .
fistral beach is already a top surfing spot mr weight said they would choose whether or not to back the scheme which , he said , could provide more jobs and wealth for cornwall .
risk management and traffic impact assessments would also have to be carried out in connection with the project .
the reef would be built from giant , sand-filled textile bags , with surf breaks ranking alongside international breaks in australia , new zealand and south africa , according to the feasibility study .
the twin-armed , arrow-shaped reef would create 200-metre long surfing rides on each " arm " .
quality conditions quality surfing conditions were likely to occur on 106 days a year with the new reef , said the study .
the consultants said the reef could last up to 100 years with maintenance .
the proposals have received support from both the environment agency and south west tourism .

one can forgive luke skywalker , captain kirk and flash gordon for monkeying with the laws of physics in the interests of a rip-roaring storyline , but does bad science make a poor sci-fi film far worse ?
every fan of science fiction film knows that for every genuinely good movie they see , they will have to endure an awful lot of rubbish .
for every innocent gem like star wars : a new hope there is a phantom menace .
and for every life-affirming classic like the incredible shrinking man there is a soul-destroying battlefield earth .
and recently - particularly this summer - there has been an awful lot of rubbish around .
a strange idiocy seems to have over-taken the makers of blockbusters such as the matrix reloaded , star wars : attack of the clones and others who are bolstering their creations with some decidedly dodgy science .
suffering science take for instance ang lee 's hulk .
in updating the 1960s comic , the screenwriters of the hulk realised that they could not rely on that old staple of radiation exposure to explain how the svelte bruce banner turns into the awesome , monstrous hulk . ... tissue from a sea cucumber now we know that the gamma radiation soaked up by the hulk would not turn him into a superhero but would cause significant health problems thanks to the penetrative power of the rays .
instead , the writers turned to the real life work of marine biologist greg szulgit from hiram college , ohio , to explain how banner bulks up into the hulk .
professor szulgit has been researching sea cucumbers and the special mutable collagenous connective tissue they possess .
this tissue can stretch massively without being destroyed and then retract back to its former size , thus providing a novel way to explain banner 's transmogrification into the huge hulk .
lazy writers it 's not quite nonsense , but pretty close .
although he was consulted by the film makers , professor szulgit says the science in hulk is " really awful " .
" as near as i could tell the sea cucumbers and comments about other echinoderms was meaningless techno-babble , " says tom rogers , co-founder of the insultingly stupid movie physics website , which aims to explain exactly how stupid movie physics often is .
the force is strong in these three " the metamorphosis of bruce banner into the hulk is ridiculous from the standpoint of physics alone , " he says .
but hulk is not alone in appealing to nonsense to make a plot point .
the matrix reloaded sought to explain exactly how the consensual hallucination that most people in the film 's universe mistake for real life is actually generated .
this confused some cinemagoers , and just plain bored others .
and for the star wars instalment phantom menace , creator george lucas thought up midi-chlorians -lsb- microscopic creatures which live inside all creatures and chatter amongst themselves -rsb- as a way to explain the formerly quasi-religious force .
he arguably managed to undermine the galaxy his characters inhabit for no real gain .
silly science all too often writers turn to the latest science to explain how something nonsensical could come about , but often they go too far .
" science fiction often has to resort to pure fabrication in order to have a plot .
when it does , our feeling is that it 's best to put it on the table with a minimum of explanation , " says mr rogers .
not all sci-fi films depend on dodgy science spiderman was just as nonsensical as hulk , but it got away with it because there were so many other good things , such as character and plot , going on .
knowing that you are working from a ridiculous premise can work if a writer manages to explore its consequences , rather than use it as a crutch to make up for other failings .
though its value as escapist fun should not be forgotten , sci-fi films can inspire young viewers to follow real careers in science and give older people vegged out on the sofa an insight into how the universe works they might not otherwise experience .
hopelessly wonky scientific explanations could , arguably , do this audience a disservice .
guy haley , deputy editor of sfx magazine , says many writers do go to great lengths to work out the way of their world .
" without that , " he says , " they would have characters doing things without establishing their motivation or why they were doing it .
explaining how it works can detract from a film " -lsb- good writers -rsb- say : ' in this universe this works this way so it 's not really ridiculous . " '
he adds that many science-fiction film fans do not mind a bit of silly science if there is enough else going on to divert them .
the 1957 classic the incredible shrinking man used radiation and pesticides to start its star shrinking and got away with it thanks to the writing and uplifting ending .
" a single questionable plot device can be forgiven in the name of art , " says mr rogers , " however , the rest of the plot should fit within the boundaries of known physical law . "

this tissue can stretch massively without being destroyed and then retract back to its former size , thus providing a novel way to explain banner 's transmogrification into the huge hulk .
lazy writers it 's not quite nonsense , but pretty close .
although he was consulted by the film makers , professor szulgit says the science in hulk is " really awful " .
" as near as i could tell the sea cucumbers and comments about other echinoderms was meaningless techno-babble , " says tom rogers , co-founder of the insultingly stupid movie physics website , which aims to explain exactly how stupid movie physics often is .
the force is strong in these three " the metamorphosis of bruce banner into the hulk is ridiculous from the standpoint of physics alone , " he says .
but hulk is not alone in appealing to nonsense to make a plot point .
the matrix reloaded sought to explain exactly how the consensual hallucination that most people in the film 's universe mistake for real life is actually generated .
this confused some cinemagoers , and just plain bored others .
and for the star wars instalment phantom menace , creator george lucas thought up midi-chlorians -lsb- microscopic creatures which live inside all creatures and chatter amongst themselves -rsb- as a way to explain the formerly quasi-religious force .
he arguably managed to undermine the galaxy his characters inhabit for no real gain .
silly science all too often writers turn to the latest science to explain how something nonsensical could come about , but often they go too far .
" science fiction often has to resort to pure fabrication in order to have a plot .
when it does , our feeling is that it 's best to put it on the table with a minimum of explanation , " says mr rogers .
not all sci-fi films depend on dodgy science spiderman was just as nonsensical as hulk , but it got away with it because there were so many other good things , such as character and plot , going on .
knowing that you are working from a ridiculous premise can work if a writer manages to explore its consequences , rather than use it as a crutch to make up for other failings .
though its value as escapist fun should not be forgotten , sci-fi films can inspire young viewers to follow real careers in science and give older people vegged out on the sofa an insight into how the universe works they might not otherwise experience .
hopelessly wonky scientific explanations could , arguably , do this audience a disservice .
guy haley , deputy editor of sfx magazine , says many writers do go to great lengths to work out the way of their world .
" without that , " he says , " they would have characters doing things without establishing their motivation or why they were doing it .
explaining how it works can detract from a film " -lsb- good writers -rsb- say : ' in this universe this works this way so it 's not really ridiculous . " '
he adds that many science-fiction film fans do not mind a bit of silly science if there is enough else going on to divert them .
the 1957 classic the incredible shrinking man used radiation and pesticides to start its star shrinking and got away with it thanks to the writing and uplifting ending .
" a single questionable plot device can be forgiven in the name of art , " says mr rogers , " however , the rest of the plot should fit within the boundaries of known physical law . "

the contest , to swim two lengths of a water-filled ditch in a mid wales peat bog , is held at llanwrtyd wells , the uk 's smallest town .
competitors must complete the muddy and reed-filled course without the aid of conventional swimming strokes and this year face a strict time limit to reach the first turn .
they have just one minute 30 seconds to reach the first turn .
philip john , of bridgend , south wales , is defending his titles as world champion and young champion against entrants from as far afield as from ireland , america , and australia .
one person who may have an edge is andrew parker , who last year lost out on the local champion title to his brother by just 10 seconds .
trench swim this year , however , he has donned his snorkel , mask and flippers to have a sneaky trial run over the 60-yard course to see if he can beat the world championship time of 1m 39secs .
he said : " the organisers have asked me to clean the trench on friday in preparation for the competition , " he said .
" i will take advantage by having a sneaky paddle up and down the trench , and i will not tell my brother i have done it . "
the event began in 1986 when local pubgoers were trying to think of a way to raise money for charity .
funds from the event will be donated to the mid wales division of the cystic fibrosis trust .

up chief minister , ms mayawati , says she wants fresh elections in the state to end political uncertainty .
there have been deep strains between ms mayawati 's bahujan samaj party -lrb- bsp -rrb- and the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , which is the junior coalition partner .
up is politically india 's most important state , sending the largest number of lawmakers to the national parliament .
governor 's role monday has been marked by confusions and denials in up .
media reports earlier in the day said ms mayawati was going to resign .
she has now denied that .
she also told a rally of her bsp party that she had decided to end the state alliance with the bjp which leads the national coalition government .
any decision about holding fresh elections would have to be formally ratified by the governor of up , vishnukant shastri , who is appointed by the central government .
mr shastri told journalists that the bjp had already informed him that it was pulling out of the state coalition .
the bbc 's ram dutt tripathi in lucknow says there is now an unprecedented constitutional crisis in uttar pradesh .
the bsp , whose power base is among lower caste hindus , agreed to share power with the bjp after inconclusive state elections last year .
in those elections another party , the samajwadi party , got the most votes , but failed to gain an overall majority .
differences between her coalition partners have sharpened recently over a controversial project to build an entertainment and shopping mall complex near the taj mahal .
ms mayawati had a row with federal bjp tourism minister jagmohan , accusing him of being aware of the project which he later ordered to be scrapped .
ms mayawati was also angry at a bjp demand for the resignation of a minister in her cabinet accused of involvement in the murder of a local poet .
