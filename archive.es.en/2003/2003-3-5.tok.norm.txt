but with the united states pressing to launch a war against iraq , fischer tossed aside his schedule and headed to paris , where he planned to meet two european allies in his drive to prevent the war - french foreign minister dominique de villepin and russian foreign minister igor ivanov .
" the three foreign ministers want to discuss the next steps of the three countries , " said a spokesman for fischer 's party , the greens .
united states presses for vote the foreign ministers ' meeting was called after the united states announced on tuesday that it was time for the 15 members on the u.n. security council " to stand up and be counted " on a resolution that would authorize a war against the regime of iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in such a showdown , the united states needs nine votes on the 15 member council - five permanent members and 10 temporary members , including germany .
the permanent members , who included france and russia , can cast a resolution-killing veto .
the question at hand focuses on two disparate ways to disarm saddam .
the united states , britian and spain are pushing for a second resolution that would declare that saddam had squandered his final opportunity to rid himself of banned weapons .
in contrast , germany , france and russia have proposed to extend the mission of u.n. weapons inspectors scouring the country for those weapons .

19 , 2001 in islamabad , pakistan .
fischer is on one day visit to pakistan to talk with pakistani president gen. pervez musharraf .
-lrb- ap photo / tariq aziz -rrb- " there are alternatives to war in iraq , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview this week with the newsmagazine stern .
" i do n't understand why we should n't use them . "
parliamentarians back inspections a similar message was delivered to the united nations this week by a group of 21 members of the european parliament , the legislative body of the european union .
" it is important to us to tell the people , the united nations as well , ... that we want the inspectors to have more time , " said lednas uka , a member of the german party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communist party .
the next steps in the diplomatic showdown are expected to be taken on friday , when weapons inspectors hans blix and mohamed elbaradei make their third report to the security council on their work in iraq .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said that afterward he would consult with other nations over the weekend .
" and then early next week we 'll make a judgment on what we have heard and whether it 's time to put the resolution up to a vote , " powell said .
one option under serious consideration is for president george w. bush to give saddam a final ultimatum , perhaps with a short-term deadline , in an address next week , two senior white house officials told the associated press .
peace groups preparing to march despite the diplomatic efforts , the united states and germany 's peace movement are making their plans for war .
bush has arrayed a force of nearly 300,000 service members who are ready to launch a land , sea and air invasion of iraq .
the force includes five aircraft carrier battle groups , each with about 50 strike aircraft .
a sixth carrier , the nimitz , is heading to the persian gulf to relieve the abraham lincoln .
u.s. war planners still hope the turkish parliament will reverse a decision it made on saturday and permit the deployment of 62,000 american troops who could invade iraq from the north .
the german peace force is also assembling its forces for a massive protest to be held on " day x , " the day that a war starts .
on the internet page of the group netzwerk friedenskooperative , around 120 events are listed .
" the scheduled events are growing exponentially , " said kristian golla , a spokesman for the group based in bonn .
the group already has demonstrated its drawing power .
on feb .
15 , roughly 500,000 protesters turned out in berlin as people across europe demonstrated against the possible war .
in a new survey , 86 percent of respondents in germany said they opposed any war against iraq .
the survey , conducted for stern , also found that 83 percent said they thought the united states would attack with or without u.n. support . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished . the statistics sound like a death toll for a country that hasn ’ t even emerged from the wounds of the last war 12 years ago and is poised on the brink of another .
of the approximately 12.5 million children in iraq , every fourth one is chronically malnourished .
five million iraqis have no access to clean drinking water , making diarrhea one of the most common ailments .
child mortality has drastically increased : at the end of the 1980s , 5.6 percent of iraqi children died before age six .
today , that figure has jumped to 13 percent , with every eighth child not making it to his or her fifth birthday .
one in four iraqi children of elementary school age does n't go to school .
the country used to have a school enrollment rate of over 90 percent .
those were the facts presented by reinhard schlagintweit , chairman of unicef germany , at a news conference in berlin on monday .
his message was clear : " whatever happens in the coming weeks in iraq , protection and help for the children must take priority . "
together with acclaimed british actress and unicef ambassador vanessa redgrave - who made a film in 1991 about the ramifications of the gulf war on children - schlagintweit stressed that the situation of children in iraq was already so drastic that another war there would probably result in a humanitarian catastrophe that would be difficult to contain .
redgrave appealed to governments around the world to put politics aside and give more priority to the well-being of children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanessa redgrave " we have to put children before politics , and most of the terrible problems in our world are the result of governments of all descriptions , successive governments , all nationalities , putting politics before children , " redgrave said .
unicef intensifies operations in iraq unicef has already redoubled its efforts in iraq to secure the basic needs of the population for at least a month in the event that war breaks out .
some 300 unicef workers in iraq - among them more than a dozen foreigners - are working round the clock to deliver basic medicines and food with high protein content , such as 150 tons of milk and 1,110 tons of biscuits , to 63 children ’ s hospitals in iraq as well as to refugee camps at the borders to iran and jordan . schlagintweit said about 240,000 children are so badly undernourished they have to be fed a special diet .
unicef has vaccinated about 4 million children against polio in the past few weeks alone , and in the coming weeks half a million children will receive shots for measles .
in the larger iraqi cities , emergency generators for water works and hospitals are being refitted with reserve fuel , and tents and school material are being stockpiled in the north of the country so that refugee families can " at least keep their children busy and distract them from the conflict , " says schlagintweit .
spokesman warns of drastic consequences of war the spokesman for unicef iraq , geoffrey keele , who spent the last nine months in baghdad , said at the news conference that diarrhea and respiratory illnesses were the most common causes of death among children .
he estimated that contaminated water - and the lack of opportunities to treat it - was the main reason for illnesses among the population .
keele stressed that about 60 percent of iraqis were completely dependent on food rations handed out by the government and warned that the consequences of a war disrupting distribution of the rations were unforeseeable .
keele also said that the situation was already crumbling in most social areas , among them nutrition , water sanitation installations , education and child protection , and that a war would only make matters worse .
as an example , he spoke of the challenges that unicef faced in providing education for children .
" the education sector is still falling rapidly .
seventy percent of all of the existing schools in the country need to be completely rebuilt .
some of them are too dangerous for children to go and study in .
in other schools , there is no glass in the windows , there is no electricity , some don ’ t have desks .
children are sitting on the floor and learning , " he said .
bracing for a swell of refugees meanwhile countries bordering iraq have already begun making preparations in anticipation of a huge wave of refugees pouring in if war breaks out .
u.n. experts estimate that 600,000 to 1.5 million iraqi refugees will seek haven in neighboring countries , while up to 2 million people will become internal refugees within iraq .
most refugees are likely to flee to iran , which shares the longest border with iraq .
tehran has already begun constructing camps for refugees .
although iranian officials expect some 200,000 iraqis to seek entry , experience has shown that there could be more .
during the 1991 gulf war , 1.3 million iraqis fled to iran . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de humanitarian organizations prepare for war germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort .

in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished . the statistics sound like a death toll for a country that hasn ’ t even emerged from the wounds of the last war 12 years ago and is poised on the brink of another .
of the approximately 12.5 million children in iraq , every fourth one is chronically malnourished .
five million iraqis have no access to clean drinking water , making diarrhea one of the most common ailments .
child mortality has drastically increased : at the end of the 1980s , 5.6 percent of iraqi children died before age six .
today , that figure has jumped to 13 percent , with every eighth child not making it to his or her fifth birthday .
one in four iraqi children of elementary school age does n't go to school .
the country used to have a school enrollment rate of over 90 percent .
those were the facts presented by reinhard schlagintweit , chairman of unicef germany , at a news conference in berlin on monday .
his message was clear : " whatever happens in the coming weeks in iraq , protection and help for the children must take priority . "
together with acclaimed british actress and unicef ambassador vanessa redgrave - who made a film in 1991 about the ramifications of the gulf war on children - schlagintweit stressed that the situation of children in iraq was already so drastic that another war there would probably result in a humanitarian catastrophe that would be difficult to contain .
redgrave appealed to governments around the world to put politics aside and give more priority to the well-being of children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vanessa redgrave " we have to put children before politics , and most of the terrible problems in our world are the result of governments of all descriptions , successive governments , all nationalities , putting politics before children , " redgrave said .
unicef intensifies operations in iraq unicef has already redoubled its efforts in iraq to secure the basic needs of the population for at least a month in the event that war breaks out .
some 300 unicef workers in iraq - among them more than a dozen foreigners - are working round the clock to deliver basic medicines and food with high protein content , such as 150 tons of milk and 1,110 tons of biscuits , to 63 children ’ s hospitals in iraq as well as to refugee camps at the borders to iran and jordan . schlagintweit said about 240,000 children are so badly undernourished they have to be fed a special diet .
unicef has vaccinated about 4 million children against polio in the past few weeks alone , and in the coming weeks half a million children will receive shots for measles .
in the larger iraqi cities , emergency generators for water works and hospitals are being refitted with reserve fuel , and tents and school material are being stockpiled in the north of the country so that refugee families can " at least keep their children busy and distract them from the conflict , " says schlagintweit .

in such a showdown , the united states needs nine votes on the 15 member council - five permanent members and 10 temporary members , including germany .

he made the comments to bbc talking point live , answering questions sent in by bbc news online readers .
the bbc 's bridget kendall interviewed mr ivanov , and here gives her impression of the veteran russian diplomat : igor ivanov stepped out of his official limousine with a spring in his step and a cheerful look on his face .
i introduced myself in russian .
he answered confidently in english .
mistake number one : contrary to my expectation , the russian foreign minister does in fact speak quite good english .
he just does not like to be interviewed in it .
no wonder , really , if you are weighing each nuanced hint you drop about a possible russian veto against assurances that moscow 's top priorities are security council unity and continued cooperation with partners like britain and america .
good humour mistake number two was to assume mr ivanov was as sombre and poker-faced as he sometimes looks at international press conferences .
i had always thought of him as " bad cop " in a " good cop : bad cop " scenario .
he got to deliver gloomy warnings of russian non-collaboration , while his boss , president vladimir putin , got to eat barbecue with the us president and look deep into his american eyes to convince him he was a guy to be trusted .
but as we made our way through the labyrinth of bbc 's television centre in london , i quickly concluded mr ivanov was anything but gloomy .
embarrassingly , we had to wait ages for a lift .
but mr ivanov 's good humour seemed boundless .
ivanov doubted the us will win a un vote " is that all for us ? " he asked , as a bbc kitchen worker pushed past a large trolley laden with water bottles .
as we all finally squeezed into the lift , he shouted jokingly to his ambassador to london : " out you get !
you 're too heavy !
the doors wo n't close ! "
and when i suggested make up for the tv cameras , he musingly replied : " i wonder what the british foreign secretary will make of me if i turn up with powder on my nose . "
direct answers my third mistake was to worry he would be evasive and long-winded .
that was to happen later , at his press conference with jack straw , a master performance on both their parts of delicacy and diplomatic obfuscation .
but for the bbc 's world audience , he was prepared to be considerably more direct .
" how long do you want my answers ? " he asked quietly before we began .
no wonder he was clear cut .
perhaps igor ivanov was determined to do his best - not just to turn the spotlight on russia in the midst of this crisis , but also on himself a little as the interview wore on , i realised this hour-long exposure to the world 's questions was taking place because russia is feeling supremely confident at this moment .
and as the poker game which is the battle for votes in the un security council reaches its climax , what better way to make your case to the international community than take to the international airwaves ?
anyway , with no obvious sign that the us , britain , and spain are winning any more allies beyond bulgaria to support their second resolution , russia can afford to relax a little .
after all , if the americans fail to win over nine voices out of the security council 's 15 to vote in favour of a resolution to pave the way for war , then moscow , like france , can brandish its veto threat without fear .
there will be little chance during this iraq crisis that it will have to use it .
well connected " i do n't think they 'll get nine votes , " he said after the interview was over , as he took off his microphone .
" i do n't think even pakistan will support the us , " he added .
igor ivanov born in 1945 was trade envoy and later ambassador to spain appointed foreign minister by boris yeltsin was russia 's chief anti-west protagonist during nato bombing of yugoslavia click here for transcript of ivanov comments he should know , i suppose .
this is a foreign minister who has telephoned seven out of the 10 rotating members of the security council in the past few days .
though of course it is always quite possible they say one thing to mr ivanov , and quite another when america 's big guns - colin powell or condoleezza rice - come on the line .
but however the votes finally stack up , my impression was that russia is already resigned to the prospect that the us - and presumably britain - will go to war without a un resolution .
in that case , mr ivanov 's message was that russia and others will remain critical of the use of force , but wo n't stop working with washington and london , or trying to bring the debate and the centre of power back to the security council .
nor was there an inkling in any of his answers , on camera or off , that moscow is considering coming round to the us view if it can do a deal on its oil interests in iraq and secure a promise to be paid back the billions of dollars iraq still owes it .
if it does turn out that russia is prepared to be won over after all in the name of economic self interest , then mr ivanov did a good job of persuading us to the contrary .
it was overall a good performance .
perhaps igor ivanov was determined to do his best - not just to turn the spotlight on russia in the midst of this crisis , but also on himself a little .
there are always rumours bubbling below the surface in moscow of possible reshuffle plots .
mr ivanov is sometimes seen , in the words of one russian official , to be " a touch old-fashioned " , a career diplomat who has been in the business a long time , since way back in another , soviet , era .
what could be more 21st century than to dip his toe into the internet and show that he too - like mr putin - can handle it ?

he made the comments to bbc talking point live , answering questions sent in by bbc news online readers .
the bbc 's bridget kendall interviewed mr ivanov , and here gives her impression of the veteran russian diplomat : igor ivanov stepped out of his official limousine with a spring in his step and a cheerful look on his face .
i introduced myself in russian .
he answered confidently in english .
mistake number one : contrary to my expectation , the russian foreign minister does in fact speak quite good english .
he just does not like to be interviewed in it .
no wonder , really , if you are weighing each nuanced hint you drop about a possible russian veto against assurances that moscow 's top priorities are security council unity and continued cooperation with partners like britain and america .
good humour mistake number two was to assume mr ivanov was as sombre and poker-faced as he sometimes looks at international press conferences .
i had always thought of him as " bad cop " in a " good cop : bad cop " scenario .
he got to deliver gloomy warnings of russian non-collaboration , while his boss , president vladimir putin , got to eat barbecue with the us president and look deep into his american eyes to convince him he was a guy to be trusted .
but as we made our way through the labyrinth of bbc 's television centre in london , i quickly concluded mr ivanov was anything but gloomy .
embarrassingly , we had to wait ages for a lift .
but mr ivanov 's good humour seemed boundless .
ivanov doubted the us will win a un vote " is that all for us ? " he asked , as a bbc kitchen worker pushed past a large trolley laden with water bottles .
as we all finally squeezed into the lift , he shouted jokingly to his ambassador to london : " out you get !
you 're too heavy !
the doors wo n't close ! "
and when i suggested make up for the tv cameras , he musingly replied : " i wonder what the british foreign secretary will make of me if i turn up with powder on my nose . "
direct answers my third mistake was to worry he would be evasive and long-winded .
that was to happen later , at his press conference with jack straw , a master performance on both their parts of delicacy and diplomatic obfuscation .
but for the bbc 's world audience , he was prepared to be considerably more direct .
" how long do you want my answers ? " he asked quietly before we began .
no wonder he was clear cut .
perhaps igor ivanov was determined to do his best - not just to turn the spotlight on russia in the midst of this crisis , but also on himself a little as the interview wore on , i realised this hour-long exposure to the world 's questions was taking place because russia is feeling supremely confident at this moment .
and as the poker game which is the battle for votes in the un security council reaches its climax , what better way to make your case to the international community than take to the international airwaves ?
anyway , with no obvious sign that the us , britain , and spain are winning any more allies beyond bulgaria to support their second resolution , russia can afford to relax a little .
after all , if the americans fail to win over nine voices out of the security council 's 15 to vote in favour of a resolution to pave the way for war , then moscow , like france , can brandish its veto threat without fear .
there will be little chance during this iraq crisis that it will have to use it .
well connected " i do n't think they 'll get nine votes , " he said after the interview was over , as he took off his microphone .
" i do n't think even pakistan will support the us , " he added .

in a decade of independence from the soviet union this tiny landlocked nation has suffered one of the world 's most dramatic population declines .
it 's estimated that more than a million people have left the country in search of a better life overseas - out of a population that was never more than 3.8 million .
yerevan itself is at first glance strikingly different from the rest of the desolate , mountainous country .
in the last few years many members of armenia 's foreign diaspora - twice as large as the population of the country itself - have come back to open businesses here .
today , the streets of yerevan are full of western-style bars , cafes and restaurants .
but only select few can afford a dinner in a sushi bar in downtown yerevan , where one mouthful may cost a week 's salary for the average armenian .
poverty half the population still lives below the poverty line , unemployment is rampant and official corruption is widespread .
waiting for well-off customers outside the japanese restaurant is a taxi driver ashot torosyan . "
kocharyan has done nothing for people at all - things have got worse " ashot torosyan , taxi driver he says that his salary of $ 30 a month is nowhere near enough to feed his family of four .
like many armenians , he says a new leader is needed to lift the country out of poverty .
on wednesday , along with thousands of others he will be voting in the second round of the presidential election , in which the incumbent president robert kocharyan faces a tough challenge from opposition leader stepan demirchyan .
" kocharyan has done nothing for people at all .
things have got worse .
and demirchyan is a young , working man , i think he will be good for this country , " mr torosyan said .
parliament killings stepan demirchyan 's father , karen , was armenia 's communist party boss in soviet times , and later became chairman of the armenian parliament - and one of nine mps murdered in a notorious 1999 parliamentary massacre .
the government 's failure to resolve the case is another grievance that some voters hold against it .
stepan demirchyan himself is a newcomer to politics , but in the past two weeks thousands of armenians have taken to the streets of yerevan to show their support for him and to protest against alleged fraud in the first round of the election on 19 february .
the official result put mr kocharyan in first place with 49.8 % of the vote .
the arrest of some 150 demonstrators by the authorities last week has only increased the bitterness .
" many people are going to leave this country because they do n't have anything to do here any more , " said arsen horosyan , a 21-year-old student .
" there has been a lot of cheating , but today we do n't really have independent mass media in armenia and so we can not tell this to the people , " he added .
" we all voted for demirchyan .
they rigged the elections .
people are dying of poverty in this country , and the government is not letting us choose , " said one demonstrator .
many see this election as a test of democracy in armenia .
if mr demirchyan wins , they fear mr kocharyan may not be willing to give up power peacefully .

in a decade of independence from the soviet union this tiny landlocked nation has suffered one of the world 's most dramatic population declines .
it 's estimated that more than a million people have left the country in search of a better life overseas - out of a population that was never more than 3.8 million .
yerevan itself is at first glance strikingly different from the rest of the desolate , mountainous country .
in the last few years many members of armenia 's foreign diaspora - twice as large as the population of the country itself - have come back to open businesses here .
today , the streets of yerevan are full of western-style bars , cafes and restaurants .
but only select few can afford a dinner in a sushi bar in downtown yerevan , where one mouthful may cost a week 's salary for the average armenian .

the government 's failure to resolve the case is another grievance that some voters hold against it .
stepan demirchyan himself is a newcomer to politics , but in the past two weeks thousands of armenians have taken to the streets of yerevan to show their support for him and to protest against alleged fraud in the first round of the election on 19 february .
the official result put mr kocharyan in first place with 49.8 % of the vote .
