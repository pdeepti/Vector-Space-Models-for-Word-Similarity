program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.02.2003 munich conference opens with sharp differences over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time 's running out - u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld both u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld and german foreign minister fischer delivered strongly-worded speeches in which they staked out their positions and crossed verbal swords over the pressing issue of iraq in munich . the 39th high-level international security conference taking place over the weekend in munich was witness to some strong speeches and verbal sparring on saturday that reflected the transatlantic tension brewing between germany and america in the past weeks .
at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .

" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .

such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .
police estimated that about 10,000 people took part in a demonstration on saturday morning under the motto , " no to war against iraq " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell fails to change german opposition on iraq as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .

in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .
police estimated that about 10,000 people took part in a demonstration on saturday morning under the motto , " no to war against iraq " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell fails to change german opposition on iraq as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .

" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .

schools and healthcare industry have an urgent need for computers . first the good news : after the u.s. and japan , germany is the world 's third-largest internet market .
and this year every second german citizen will use the internet , according to a new study by the trade association bitkom . but while ever more germans are surfing the net , bitkom reports that the country lags far behind other european nations in terms of internet usage and access to technology . in scandinavian countries - and in the united states - 8 out of every 10 residents use the internet .
in the online business , these are fully different worlds , said bernhard rohleder , chairman of bitkom . 30 years to catch up " that 's a condition that ca n't be corrected in five or 10 years , " rohleder said .
" if we keep going like we 've been going - that means installing an additional 1.5 million computers a year - we 'll need 30 years to catch up with the united states . " the germans ' limited knowledge of english is one of the problems cited by bitkom , as well as the relatively high prices of computers . the problem is acute within the education and healthcare sectors , bitkom reported . every 28 students have internet access in 2002 , an average of 14 german students had to share each computer in the public schools .
for every 28 students there was internet access .
that puts germany in the third-to-last spot in europe : only students in portugal and greece fare worse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.02.2003 munich conference opens with sharp differences over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time 's running out - u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld both u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld and german foreign minister fischer delivered strongly-worded speeches in which they staked out their positions and crossed verbal swords over the pressing issue of iraq in munich . the 39th high-level international security conference taking place over the weekend in munich was witness to some strong speeches and verbal sparring on saturday that reflected the transatlantic tension brewing between germany and america in the past weeks .
at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .
police estimated that about 10,000 people took part in a demonstration on saturday morning under the motto , " no to war against iraq " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell fails to change german opposition on iraq as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts .

schools and healthcare industry have an urgent need for computers . first the good news : after the u.s. and japan , germany is the world 's third-largest internet market .
and this year every second german citizen will use the internet , according to a new study by the trade association bitkom . but while ever more germans are surfing the net , bitkom reports that the country lags far behind other european nations in terms of internet usage and access to technology . in scandinavian countries - and in the united states - 8 out of every 10 residents use the internet .
in the online business , these are fully different worlds , said bernhard rohleder , chairman of bitkom . 30 years to catch up " that 's a condition that ca n't be corrected in five or 10 years , " rohleder said .
" if we keep going like we 've been going - that means installing an additional 1.5 million computers a year - we 'll need 30 years to catch up with the united states . " the germans ' limited knowledge of english is one of the problems cited by bitkom , as well as the relatively high prices of computers . the problem is acute within the education and healthcare sectors , bitkom reported . every 28 students have internet access in 2002 , an average of 14 german students had to share each computer in the public schools .
for every 28 students there was internet access .
that puts germany in the third-to-last spot in europe : only students in portugal and greece fare worse .
in denmark , meanwhile , there is one computer per student . rohleder urged germany to follow the example of sweden and offer tax incentives that would encourage parents to buy computers for their children and businesses to donate computers to schools . in german hospitals , doctor offices and pharmacies , computers play a small role , bitkom reported .
just 6 percent of general practitioners use a computer for the exchange of patient data .
that puts germany in last place within europe . in this case , rohleder pointed to the united states as an example , where patients often get a card with data such as x-rays and prescriptions readily available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pharmacists battle one-stop internet shopping need a bottle of aspirin or a refill on a medication , but don ’ t want to go to the local pharmacy ?

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .

for every 28 students there was internet access .
that puts germany in the third-to-last spot in europe : only students in portugal and greece fare worse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.02.2003 munich conference opens with sharp differences over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time 's running out - u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld both u.s. defense secretary rumsfeld and german foreign minister fischer delivered strongly-worded speeches in which they staked out their positions and crossed verbal swords over the pressing issue of iraq in munich . the 39th high-level international security conference taking place over the weekend in munich was witness to some strong speeches and verbal sparring on saturday that reflected the transatlantic tension brewing between germany and america in the past weeks .
at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .
police estimated that about 10,000 people took part in a demonstration on saturday morning under the motto , " no to war against iraq " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell fails to change german opposition on iraq as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .
police estimated that about 10,000 people took part in a demonstration on saturday morning under the motto , " no to war against iraq " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell fails to change german opposition on iraq as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts .

at the closely guarded conference attended by more than 250 top-level military officials and politicians from 40 countries , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld said that washington still hoped war against iraq would not be necessary , but that the world was serious about disarming baghdad .
rumsfeld : " no one wants war " " no one wants war .
war is never a first or an easy choice .
but the risks of war need to be balanced against the risks of doing nothing while iraq pursues weapons of mass destruction , " rumsfeld told the gathering .
he said that it was difficult to understand how anyone could still doubt iraq ’ s intentions after u.s. secretary of state colin powell ’ s report to the u.n. security council a few days ago .
in saturday ’ s speech rumsfeld urged the international community to support the military pressure on saddam hussein to avoid a war .
" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .

schools and healthcare industry have an urgent need for computers . first the good news : after the u.s. and japan , germany is the world 's third-largest internet market .
and this year every second german citizen will use the internet , according to a new study by the trade association bitkom . but while ever more germans are surfing the net , bitkom reports that the country lags far behind other european nations in terms of internet usage and access to technology . in scandinavian countries - and in the united states - 8 out of every 10 residents use the internet .
in the online business , these are fully different worlds , said bernhard rohleder , chairman of bitkom . 30 years to catch up " that 's a condition that ca n't be corrected in five or 10 years , " rohleder said .
" if we keep going like we 've been going - that means installing an additional 1.5 million computers a year - we 'll need 30 years to catch up with the united states . " the germans ' limited knowledge of english is one of the problems cited by bitkom , as well as the relatively high prices of computers . the problem is acute within the education and healthcare sectors , bitkom reported . every 28 students have internet access in 2002 , an average of 14 german students had to share each computer in the public schools .
for every 28 students there was internet access .
that puts germany in the third-to-last spot in europe : only students in portugal and greece fare worse .
in denmark , meanwhile , there is one computer per student . rohleder urged germany to follow the example of sweden and offer tax incentives that would encourage parents to buy computers for their children and businesses to donate computers to schools . in german hospitals , doctor offices and pharmacies , computers play a small role , bitkom reported .
just 6 percent of general practitioners use a computer for the exchange of patient data .
that puts germany in last place within europe . in this case , rohleder pointed to the united states as an example , where patients often get a card with data such as x-rays and prescriptions readily available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pharmacists battle one-stop internet shopping need a bottle of aspirin or a refill on a medication , but don ’ t want to go to the local pharmacy ?

" if the international community once again shows a lack of decisiveness , then there ’ s no chance that saddam hussein will voluntarily disarm or flee and thus no chance for a peaceful outcome , " he said .
rumsfeld said that iraq had been given years to disarm and now the world would know within " days or weeks " whether it was cooperating with u.n. inspectors .
" he -lrb- saddam -rrb- has not been contained , he is successfully getting into that country darn near everything he wants , " he said .
even american senator john mccain from arizona , who is part of rumsfeld 's delegation , sharply criticized the stance of german and french politicians towards iraq .
without naming people , senator mccain accused both countries of acting in " calculated self-interest " and of a " disinformed , primitive anti-americanism " .
german minister sticks to his guns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer for his part german foreign minister joschka fischer said on saturday that he remained unconvinced of the case for a war against iraq .
he rejected suggestions that europe was divided on the issue , saying public opinion was firmly against war .
" i am not convinced .
that is my problem .
i can not go the public and say that these are the reasons because i won ’ t believe in them , " fischer said .
the german foreign minister instead pleaded in his speech that the u.n. weapons inspectors should continue their work and be given more time to carry out inspections .
fischer turned down rumsfeld ’ s demand for a quick decision .
" we shouldn ’ t just follow the logic of a military attack , " he said .
the minister renewed his criticism of the u.s. stance of forcing iraq to disarm through war if necessary .
he said the international community was not yet finished with its responsibilities in afghanistan and the weeding out of the extremist al qaeda .
" that ’ s the first critical question that i ask is why is this being prioritized now ?
to this day i ca n't see why .
saddam hussein is a terrible dictator .
but we have known that for a long time , " he said .
fischer also reiterated the high risks that a war in iraq could mean for stability in the middle east and the war against terror .
rumsfeld : nato 's dithering " inexcusable " the u.s. defense secretary however reserved harsher criticism for nato ’ s failure to take a decision on giving military aid to turkey in the event of a war against iraq .
he branded as " inexcusable " the move by germany , france and belgium to stall nato ’ s decision on the issue with the argument that providing military support to turkey , which shares a border with iraq , could undermine diplomatic efforts to avert a conflict .
on thursday nato secretary-general george robertson gave the allies until monday to object to the measures , which include deploying patriot missiles and surveillance planes to turkey .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that , it is beyond my comprehension ...
turkey is an ally , the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld told the conference .
rumsfeld 's comments trigger protest over the past two weeks , rumsfeld has whipped up a storm in germany with his disparaging comments about germany ’ s opposition to u.s. policy on iraq .
in late january , he labeled germany and france , another critic of u.s. plans , as the " old europe " .
he followed those up with a further controversial comparison on wednesday , by lumping germany together with libya and cuba when he described the three as the countries that have indicated they would not help america in a war against iraq in any way .
in saturday 's speech , rumsfeld refrained from criticizing germany directly and instead played down his comments on the " old europe " .
" when i spoke a few days ago of the old europe i caused quite a stir , but if you take my age into consideration , then i think that could be pretty friendly , " he said .
transatlantic ties under strain there is little doubt that once-taut ties between the united states and germany - ties that were tightened during four decades of the cold war and knotted by american support of german reunification in 1990 - have been come undone in the past months .
chancellor gerhard schröder has been mute in his public comments about rumsfeld 's latest statement .
but a high-ranking member of the german foreign ministry let the united states know friday about the difficulties that rumsfeld had created .
" it is simply not wise to carelessly endanger a partnership that has been so important to us with such irresponsible comments , " said karsten voigt , the government 's coordinator for german-american affairs , in a radio interview .
voigt also pointed out that germany was making a contribution to the u.s. war on terrorism .
the germans and the dutch will take over the leadership of the international security assistance force in kabul on monday .
germany also is assigning 2,600 soldiers to guard 95 u.s. bases and facilities within the country as the american military has built up its forces around iraq , and schröder has promised the americans that they could use these bases to conduct any war .
" when -lrb- rumsfeld -rrb- fails to publicly mention this , i think he is making a political mistake , " voigt said in a separate radio interview .
those outside the government made even stronger comments .
" rumsfeld has flipped out , " former foreign minister klaus kinkel said on the television news channel n-tv .
at the conference , german defense minister peter struck plans to have a closed-door session with rumsfeld .
struck told a munich newspaper that he planned to use the meeting to clear up some issues between the countries .
u.s. economic pressure on german companies says paper the high-level conflict has unsettled the german business community , much as bush 's military buildup has troubled the country 's peace movement .
" we are extremely concerned that we could lose 10 percent of our exports to the united states , " said anton börner , the president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade .
such a loss could be devastating for the german economy , börner told a newspaper in hanover , the neue presse .
in the face of germany 's high unemployment rate and stagnating economy , he said schröder was acting irresponsibly in his opposition to the u.s. drive to overthrow saddam .
in the latest development , the german newspaper welt am sonntag has reported that the united states is reportedly putting economic pressure on berlin .
the paper says that the u.s. has decided to cut its planned multi-million investments in german military bases .
the bush administration has also threatened to put economic pressure on german companies that do business with iraq , the paper reports .
a letter sent by the government in washington to germany 's economics minister wolfgang clement reportedly names firms such as siemens and warned that they would lose their business ties to the u.s. if they continued to export to iraq .
germany has strong trade ties to iraq worth some 336 million euro .
the u.s. defense secretary 's visit to europe to drum up support for a possible american-led military attack against iraq has been met with large anti-war demonstrations and protests .
hundreds of demonstrators have poured into munich to join protests against the conference of what they see as the " world 's war elite " and a possible war against iraq .
police estimated that about 10,000 people took part in a demonstration on saturday morning under the motto , " no to war against iraq " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powell fails to change german opposition on iraq as germany renewed its opposition to war against iraq after powell 's speech , u.s. defense secretary , rumsfeld directed a new dart at it , saying germany , libya and cuba are the only countries not helping american efforts .

schools and healthcare industry have an urgent need for computers . first the good news : after the u.s. and japan , germany is the world 's third-largest internet market .
and this year every second german citizen will use the internet , according to a new study by the trade association bitkom . but while ever more germans are surfing the net , bitkom reports that the country lags far behind other european nations in terms of internet usage and access to technology . in scandinavian countries - and in the united states - 8 out of every 10 residents use the internet .
in the online business , these are fully different worlds , said bernhard rohleder , chairman of bitkom . 30 years to catch up " that 's a condition that ca n't be corrected in five or 10 years , " rohleder said .
" if we keep going like we 've been going - that means installing an additional 1.5 million computers a year - we 'll need 30 years to catch up with the united states . " the germans ' limited knowledge of english is one of the problems cited by bitkom , as well as the relatively high prices of computers . the problem is acute within the education and healthcare sectors , bitkom reported . every 28 students have internet access in 2002 , an average of 14 german students had to share each computer in the public schools .
for every 28 students there was internet access .
that puts germany in the third-to-last spot in europe : only students in portugal and greece fare worse .
in denmark , meanwhile , there is one computer per student . rohleder urged germany to follow the example of sweden and offer tax incentives that would encourage parents to buy computers for their children and businesses to donate computers to schools . in german hospitals , doctor offices and pharmacies , computers play a small role , bitkom reported .
just 6 percent of general practitioners use a computer for the exchange of patient data .
that puts germany in last place within europe . in this case , rohleder pointed to the united states as an example , where patients often get a card with data such as x-rays and prescriptions readily available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german pharmacists battle one-stop internet shopping need a bottle of aspirin or a refill on a medication , but don ’ t want to go to the local pharmacy ?

some 139 nations have signed the treaty setting up the court , with the notable exception of the united states .
war crimes the court , which was initiated in 1998 , follows the precedent set by the nuremberg and tokyo war crimes trials of german and japanese leaders after world war ii .
the icc will be able to try crimes only committed after 1 july , 2002 , and only when states are unwilling to take action against suspected individuals themselves .
human rights campaigners praised the selection of the judges as an important step forward .
" we think it sends a very strong message that there 's wide support for this court , that the court 's really on it 's way , " said fiona mckay , of the lawyers committee for human rights .
' strong bench ' the number of women judges chosen for the icc is unprecedented for an international court .
the us fears hostile countries could use the icc as a political tool the president of the court 's governing body , jordan 's un ambassador prince zeid al-hussein , said member states had elected " a very strong bench " .
the judges include claude jorda of france , president of the yugoslav tribunal ; navanethem pillay of south africa , president of the rwanda war crimes tribunal ; and hans-peter kaul of germany , an expert on international humanitarian law .
the judges will be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on 11 march , and is expected to become operational after the selection of a chief prosecutor in april .
us president george w bush withdrew america 's initial support for the court , fearing hostile states could pursue politically motivated prosecutions against america .

investigators say the blast was caused by explosives - possibly a car bomb placed in an indoor car park at the club nogal , which is frequented by colombia 's political elite and foreign diplomats .
it was a huge explosion - i thought an airplane had crashed outside luis moreno witness more than 110 people were injured in the blast , which blew the facade off the 10-storey building scattering debris over seventh avenue , the city 's main street , which was crowded at the time with revellers or people heading home .
firefighters are working to reach survivors believed to be trapped on the sixth to eight floors and to put out the blaze .
" it was a huge explosion - i thought an airplane had crashed outside , " luis moreno , who lives across the street from the club , said .
colombian tv said the blast had occurred on the third floor at 2015 -lrb- 0115 gmt -rrb- and had torn a hole through the building which was " quite full " at the time .
media reports said there were many children in the building at the time of the blast .
president alvaro uribe has visited the scene of the explosion .
rebels suspected the explosion came just hours after national police head general teodoro campo announced that his officers had thwarted a string of planned city bombings .
incidents such as this have occurred regularly in bogota in recent years and are usually blamed by the government on left-wing rebels .
fingers are pointing at the country 's largest rebel group , the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- , the bbc 's jeremy mcdermott reports .
the group has , our correspondent says , brought its 39-year war against the state into the cities with a wave of car bombs and attacks with mortars on government buildings .
' fireball ' as black smoke poured from the building and flames licked around the upper windows , paramedics treated the injured in the rubble .
one witness , catalina ortiz , said she was passing the scene in a car with her daughter and husband when she thought the vehicle had been hit .
club nogal advertises itself as " one of the most important corporate , social and cultural centres in bogota " features children 's and young people 's areas - they were due to close just minutes before the blast other facilities include : five eating areas , an art gallery and 10th-floor swimming-pool " when i looked back , i saw the club was on fire , with a ball of fire coming out of the third or fourth floor , " she said .
" while i was looking back , things began to fall out of the building . "
the club features luxurious meeting rooms , a squash court , swimming pool , sauna , hotel and several restaurants .
bogota mayor antanus mockus said a theory that the explosion may have been an accident had been discarded by investigators .

her father erich , 61 and mother eileen flew to the uk from their home in falls church , virginia on sunday afternoon .
on monday they will visit the murder scene in victoria park , tower hamlets , east london where miss muller was stabbed to death on 3 february .
they will be brought up to date about the murder inquiry before taking their daughter 's body home to the us .
last week police said she , or a woman who looked like her , was seen with a man at the time of the murder .
if the woman was the 27-year-old murder victim then it is a " significant new lead " , said detective chief superintendent john shatford .
" there has been a sighting in the park on the morning that margaret was killed of a young lady fitting her description , in that she was wearing a green fleece similar to margaret 's , " he said .
" at one stage she was seen to be in company with a man who ran beside her . "

a man seen with miss muller in the good mixer pub in camden , north london , the night before she died , has come forward and been eliminated from police inquiries .
but police are still trying to trace two men " of mediterranean appearance " seen running from victoria park at the time of the murder .
miss muller moved to london from the us in 1998 and studied and worked at the slade school of fine art .
she had a studio in a converted factory in hackney in which she lived .
police have been speaking to friends and other artists to build up a fuller picture of her life and investigate whether she may have known her killer .
more than a dozen floral tributes have been left near the scene of the murder .
one read : " dear margaret , you once said to me 'i look forward to getting to know you better ' ...
i wish we 'd had more time to get to know each other . "

the series , dubbed man v machine , was played in new york , with the two sides taking a game each - the other four were drawn .
i had one item on my agenda today - not to lose garry kasparov kasparov had said he was in the match against deep junior - an israeli-built computer - to represent the human race .
the final game on friday was a draw .
for kasparov the contest was an opportunity to avenge his 1997 defeat by ibm 's supercomputer deep blue - an event regarded by some as a landmark in the development of artificial intelligence .
in the final game , kasparov played himself into a superior position but offered a draw on the 23rd move , surprising chess experts .
deep junior turned down the offer but offered its own draw five moves later .
there were boos in the crowd when kasparov accepted , the associated press news agency reports .
older and wiser after the game , kasparov defended his decision to play safe .
" i had one item on my agenda today , not to lose , " he said .
" i decided it would be wiser to stop playing . "
kasparov said he would have pressed for a win in a similar position against a human opponent .
but he said he feared a tiny mistake would have been severely punished by the computer .
deep junior is capable of analysing three million moves per second , and is itself the three-time chess computer world champion .
kasparov was also tied going into his final game with deep blue in 1997 - which he lost .

the series , dubbed man v machine , was played in new york , with the two sides taking a game each - the other four were drawn . "
i had one item on my agenda today - not to lose " garry kasparov kasparov had said he was in the match against deep junior - an israeli-built computer - to represent the human race .
the final game on friday was a draw .
for kasparov the contest was an opportunity to avenge his 1997 defeat by ibm 's supercomputer deep blue - an event regarded by some as a landmark in the development of artificial intelligence .
in the final game , kasparov played himself into a superior position but offered a draw on the 23rd move , surprising chess experts .
deep junior turned down the offer but offered its own draw five moves later .
there were boos in the crowd when kasparov accepted , the associated press news agency reports .
older and wiser after the game , kasparov defended his decision to play safe .
" i had one item on my agenda today , not to lose , " he said .
" i decided it would be wiser to stop playing . "
kasparov said he would have pressed for a win in a similar position against a human opponent .
but he said he feared a tiny mistake would have been severely punished by the computer .
deep junior is capable of analysing three million moves per second , and is itself the three-time chess computer world champion .
kasparov was also tied going into his final game with deep blue in 1997 - which he lost .
' beast ' the latest series had started well for the russian grandmaster when he won the first game against the computer .

at least five soldiers were killed as they prayed late on friday , a senior afghan official said .
mohammed mohuddin said two other troops had been kidnapped by the suspected rebels who were then suspected of having fled over the border to pakistan .
the attack took place near choto , 300 kilometres -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- south of the former taleban stronghold of kandahar .
afghan and western intelligence sources suspect that members of the taleban and al-qaeda may have joined forces with fighters loyal to warlord gulbuddin hekmatyar to battle government troops and their us backers .
rescue mission mr mohuddin , an adviser to the governor of helmand , said men in five vehicles attacked the soldiers during prayers .
one soldier shot during the attack was being treated at a local hospital , he said .
the associated press news agency reported that kandahar 's head of intelligence , dad mohammed , and 400 soldiers were going to the area to investigate the attack and search for the kidnapped troops .

mayor ken livingstone 's scheme to charge drivers £ 5 a day to enter central london between 0700 gmt and 1830 gmt begins on 17 february .
he hopes it will reduce traffic by 10 % to 15 % and raise at least £ 130m a year towards improving public transport .
but it may need to be improved and extended if congestion across london is to be reduced , said david begg , who chairs the government 's commission for integrated transport .
could heathrow get its own charge zone ?
mr begg , who is also on the transport for london board , told the financial times : " there 's a big growth in traffic and congestion in outer london and we need to look at tackling that .
" it ca n't be tackled just by improving public transport .
he added : " if -lrb- the scheme is -rrb- successful then transport for london needs to look at the zone where the cordon is , the level of the charge and more sophisticated electronic technology which allows you to distinguish between peak and off-peak travel . "
people living on the boundary fear it will increase congestion on the inner ring road , which is itself not subject to the charge .
but transport for london has said there are no plans to extend the charging area yet .
a spokesman said : " this is something that the mayor has talked about in the past but only once the charge is in and has been assessed .
" the mayor has talked also about a charging zone around heathrow , for example . "
any extension would not take place before the next mayoral election in 2004 , he added .
