before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for the u.n. to be given a central role in the country 's postwar administration , and two leading members of schröder 's party , the social democrats , reiterated that demand in a radio interviews on tuesday with german public radio .
" when it is not possible to create a major role for the united nations , the chances of creating peace in the region are much smaller , " said gernot erler , a leading social democrat in the german parliament .
erler said the united states and britain were unqualified to lead the effort because the iraqi people did not view them as liberators .
" therefore , someone who is considered to be neutral must be given the authority over the future organization , " he said .

the palestine hotel , where much of the foreign media is based , was suddenly turned into a scene of devastaion and confusion as the tank round hit the 15th floor of the building .
television pictures from the scene showed the bodies of the injured journalists being hurriedly carried through the lobby of the hotel while other reporters , visibly shaken , ran for cover clutching their equipment .
journalist and cameraman killed two cameramen - jose couso , working for spain 's telecinco and ukrainian cameraman taras protsyuk covering the war for reuters news agency - died from injuries sustained in the shelling .
reuters editor-in-chief geert linnebank said : " we are devastated by the death of taras , who had distinguished himself with his highly professional coverage in some of the most violent conflicts of the past decade . "
a reuters reporter and technician were also wounded in the attack .

u.s. troops under attack meanwhile , on the streets of baghdad , the initial euphoria surrounding the sight of u.s. troops calmly strolling around a number of captured presidential palaces on monday was replaced by the grim reality of brutal urban warfare .

fierce machine gun , rocket and mortar attacks rocked the main presidential compound as iraqi troops attempted to regain control of the palace grounds .
four u.s. abrams tanks defending the captured compound returned continuous heavy fire as armored vehicles advanced towards the iraqi positions , with low-flying u.s. war planes provided air support .
heavy fighting was also reported across the river , on the east bank of the tigris , where a firefight between a u.s. armored unit and iraqi forces was raging around a central baghdad high-rise building , until recently used by one of iraq 's deputy prime ministers .
coalition casualties mount in baghdad battles elsewhere , coalition forces continued to encounter scattered resistance in and around baghdad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy fighting is claiming casualties on both sides .
the u.s. 7th marines division , slowly but surely gaining ground in the southeastern suburbs of the city , met with iraqi small-arms fire as it pushed farther into baghdad on tuesday .

the palestine hotel , where much of the foreign media is based , was suddenly turned into a scene of devastaion and confusion as the tank round hit the 15th floor of the building .
television pictures from the scene showed the bodies of the injured journalists being hurriedly carried through the lobby of the hotel while other reporters , visibly shaken , ran for cover clutching their equipment .
journalist and cameraman killed two cameramen - jose couso , working for spain 's telecinco and ukrainian cameraman taras protsyuk covering the war for reuters news agency - died from injuries sustained in the shelling .
reuters editor-in-chief geert linnebank said : " we are devastated by the death of taras , who had distinguished himself with his highly professional coverage in some of the most violent conflicts of the past decade . "
a reuters reporter and technician were also wounded in the attack .
david chater , a journalist with sky news reporting from the hotel said : " i noticed one of the tanks had its barrel pointed up at the building .
we went inside ... and there was an almighty crash , a huge explosion that shook the hotel . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tank fire in baghdad .
u.s. military officials expressed regret at the incident , saying one of their tanks had responsed to incoming sniper and rocket fire fired from the hotel .
" a tank was receiving small arms fire ... from the hotel and engaged the target with one tank round , " said general buford blount , commander of the u.s. 3rd infantry division in baghdad .
in a separate incident , a correspondent from the qatar-based al-jazeera network was killed and a colleague was hurt when at least one us missile hit the station 's baghdad office .
a journalist from the spanish newspaper el mundo and a german journalist with the news magazine focus were killed on monday when an iraqi missile struck the u.s. army camp in south of baghdad where they were sheltering .
both sides in the iraq war have been condemned for the deaths of reporters by the international federation of journalists , which represents hundreds of thousands of journalists around the world .
twelve foreign journalists have died in iraq since the start of the war , and two are missing .
decapitation attack targets saddam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a b1-b bomber .
meanwhile , the coalition offensive in the capital continues after a second " decapitation attack " intended to kill president saddam hussein and at least one of his sons was mounted in a residential area of the city.acting on what military sources referred to as " time-sensitive intelligence , " a single u.s. b1-b bomber swooped out of the blackened sky over baghdad on monday to target what was believed to be the latest sanctuary sought by the dictator and his sons qusay and uday .
dropping its payload of four precision-guided jdam bombs , weighing 907 kilograms -lrb- 2,000 pounds -rrb- each , the building in the mansour neighborhood of the capital was reduced to smoldering rubble at around 2 p.m. local time .
" there is a big hole where that target used to be , " said one u.s. official .
however , the attack also severely damaged a restaurant and surrounding apartments with reports circulating that at least nine people were killed and 13 others wounded , mainly civilians .
there were no confirmed killings of top iraqi officials despite high optimism amongst u.s. intelligence officials that the building housed the iraqi president and his sons as well as high-ranking military figures at the time of the strike .
a senior administration official in washington said the strike was " very much the same " as the initial " decapitation attack " that began the war .
speaking at a joint press conference with british prime minister tony blair at their war summit in belfast , u.s. president george w. bush said : " i do n't know whether -lrb- saddam -rrb- survived .
the only thing i know is that he 's losing power . "
" saddam hussein will be gone .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for the u.n. to be given a central role in the country 's postwar administration , and two leading members of schröder 's party , the social democrats , reiterated that demand in a radio interviews on tuesday with german public radio .
" when it is not possible to create a major role for the united nations , the chances of creating peace in the region are much smaller , " said gernot erler , a leading social democrat in the german parliament .
erler said the united states and britain were unqualified to lead the effort because the iraqi people did not view them as liberators .
" therefore , someone who is considered to be neutral must be given the authority over the future organization , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul developmental minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the united nations not only should supply humanitarian aid but also should oversee the reconstruction of the country .
" the people who started the war are the ones responsible for providing the financial assistance , " wieczorek-zeul said .
arab council backs u.n. as well support for the united nations extends beyond germany .
the six members of the gulf cooperation council called on monday for the united nations to help the iraqis reorganize their government .
the council members " reaffirm that it is important for iraqis to run all the affairs of their country , " said abdulrahman al-attiyah , secretary-general of the loose political and economic alliance , at the end of a meeting of gcc foreign ministers .
in addition , u.n. general-secretary kofi annan will begin a trip to europe on wednesday to push the case for the united nations .
annan will meet with blair on wednesday before traveling to three countries that led the fight against the war - france , germany and russia .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the united nations , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .

following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .
with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .
at the same time , she stressed it was important for brussels to take over responsibility for europe-wide public health policy if epidemics in future were to be tackled effectively and for consistent health standards throughout the eu .

following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .
with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .

the palestine hotel , where much of the foreign media is based , was suddenly turned into a scene of devastaion and confusion as the tank round hit the 15th floor of the building .
television pictures from the scene showed the bodies of the injured journalists being hurriedly carried through the lobby of the hotel while other reporters , visibly shaken , ran for cover clutching their equipment .
journalist and cameraman killed two cameramen - jose couso , working for spain 's telecinco and ukrainian cameraman taras protsyuk covering the war for reuters news agency - died from injuries sustained in the shelling .
reuters editor-in-chief geert linnebank said : " we are devastated by the death of taras , who had distinguished himself with his highly professional coverage in some of the most violent conflicts of the past decade . "
a reuters reporter and technician were also wounded in the attack .
david chater , a journalist with sky news reporting from the hotel said : " i noticed one of the tanks had its barrel pointed up at the building .
we went inside ... and there was an almighty crash , a huge explosion that shook the hotel . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tank fire in baghdad .
u.s. military officials expressed regret at the incident , saying one of their tanks had responsed to incoming sniper and rocket fire fired from the hotel .
" a tank was receiving small arms fire ... from the hotel and engaged the target with one tank round , " said general buford blount , commander of the u.s. 3rd infantry division in baghdad .
in a separate incident , a correspondent from the qatar-based al-jazeera network was killed and a colleague was hurt when at least one us missile hit the station 's baghdad office .
a journalist from the spanish newspaper el mundo and a german journalist with the news magazine focus were killed on monday when an iraqi missile struck the u.s. army camp in south of baghdad where they were sheltering .
both sides in the iraq war have been condemned for the deaths of reporters by the international federation of journalists , which represents hundreds of thousands of journalists around the world .
twelve foreign journalists have died in iraq since the start of the war , and two are missing .
decapitation attack targets saddam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a b1-b bomber .
meanwhile , the coalition offensive in the capital continues after a second " decapitation attack " intended to kill president saddam hussein and at least one of his sons was mounted in a residential area of the city.acting on what military sources referred to as " time-sensitive intelligence , " a single u.s. b1-b bomber swooped out of the blackened sky over baghdad on monday to target what was believed to be the latest sanctuary sought by the dictator and his sons qusay and uday .
dropping its payload of four precision-guided jdam bombs , weighing 907 kilograms -lrb- 2,000 pounds -rrb- each , the building in the mansour neighborhood of the capital was reduced to smoldering rubble at around 2 p.m. local time .
" there is a big hole where that target used to be , " said one u.s. official .
however , the attack also severely damaged a restaurant and surrounding apartments with reports circulating that at least nine people were killed and 13 others wounded , mainly civilians .
there were no confirmed killings of top iraqi officials despite high optimism amongst u.s. intelligence officials that the building housed the iraqi president and his sons as well as high-ranking military figures at the time of the strike .
a senior administration official in washington said the strike was " very much the same " as the initial " decapitation attack " that began the war .
speaking at a joint press conference with british prime minister tony blair at their war summit in belfast , u.s. president george w. bush said : " i do n't know whether -lrb- saddam -rrb- survived .
the only thing i know is that he 's losing power . "
" saddam hussein will be gone .
it might have been yesterday , i do n't know , " bush added .
u.s. troops under attack meanwhile , on the streets of baghdad , the initial euphoria surrounding the sight of u.s. troops calmly strolling around a number of captured presidential palaces on monday was replaced by the grim reality of brutal urban warfare .
as a10 and f-14 fighter jets set about decimating iraqi units in the center of the capital from first light on tuesday , troops from the u.s. army 's 3rd infantry , who had remained in the city overnight , found themselves under intense counterattack as morning dawned in baghdad .
fierce machine gun , rocket and mortar attacks rocked the main presidential compound as iraqi troops attempted to regain control of the palace grounds .
four u.s. abrams tanks defending the captured compound returned continuous heavy fire as armored vehicles advanced towards the iraqi positions , with low-flying u.s. war planes provided air support .
heavy fighting was also reported across the river , on the east bank of the tigris , where a firefight between a u.s. armored unit and iraqi forces was raging around a central baghdad high-rise building , until recently used by one of iraq 's deputy prime ministers .
coalition casualties mount in baghdad battles elsewhere , coalition forces continued to encounter scattered resistance in and around baghdad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy fighting is claiming casualties on both sides .
the u.s. 7th marines division , slowly but surely gaining ground in the southeastern suburbs of the city , met with iraqi small-arms fire as it pushed farther into baghdad on tuesday .
in the west , ground troops were involved in heavy fighting as they moved towards the heart of the capital .
on the city 's eastern front , two u.s. soldiers were killed as the 3rd battalion , 4th marines approached the capital under sustained iraqi mortar and artillery fire while attempting to secure a bridge over a canal near the tigris river on the southeastern outskirts .

serbia has detained nearly 2,000 people in connection with the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic , and officials say many of them have confessed to their roles in the plot . it would take a new prison to house all of the suspects arrested by serb authorities in the hunt for the killer of prime minister zoran djindjic and the people behind the plot .
as part of the investigation launched after the march 12 sniper attack , police detained more than 7,000 people .
of these , nearly 2,000 are still in custody , creating the need to house some of the suspects in military prisons .
but such details are only of secondary importance to officials like the serbian interior minister , dusan mihajlovic , who are interested in finding those responsible for the killing .
and mihajlovic expressed his satisfaction this week about the progress police have made .
" all of the questions have been answered in connection with the assassination , " he said .
" we have the exact list of people who were part of the plot and the shooting . ...
what is more interesting : the majority have confessed to being part of the plot . "
shooting suspect in custody the people under arrest include the main shooting suspect , zvezdan jovanovic , who was an assistant commander of the police unit for special operations that fought in the balkan wars of the 1990s .
like many of the detained people , jovanovic is suspected of being a member of a belgrade-based criminal organization that controls the drug trade in and around the capital .
the group is known as the zemun gang , named after the district in belgrade where it is based .
police are still searching for one of its leaders , milorad lukovic , a former commander of the police unit .
the charismatic djindjic , who spearheaded the popular protests that brought down yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic in october 2000 , was mortally wounded by two sniper bullets as he entered government buildings in the capital , belgrade , on march 12 .
djindjic made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia left behind by milosevic .
his trade of milosevic in return for $ 1.2 billion in western aid packages enraged nationalists , including his one-time ally , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
their resulting feud paralyzed moves to implement economic and social reform , viewed by analysts as vital to the country 's future .
state of emergency declared djindjic also led efforts to establish democracy , and crack down on corruption and organized crime .
after his death , the government declared a state of emergency and gave police extra powers to hold suspects and raid houses .
serbia 's justice minister , vladan batic , has said he expected the first trials to be held in the fall .
and djindjic 's successor , zoran zivkovic , has said the state of emergency will be lifted in about three weeks if nothing serious happens . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : a place where deadly crime is part of life serbian prime minister zoran djindjic lived and governed in a land of violent crime .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .

the palestine hotel , where much of the foreign media is based , was suddenly turned into a scene of devastaion and confusion as the tank round hit the 15th floor of the building .
television pictures from the scene showed the bodies of the injured journalists being hurriedly carried through the lobby of the hotel while other reporters , visibly shaken , ran for cover clutching their equipment .
journalist and cameraman killed two cameramen - jose couso , working for spain 's telecinco and ukrainian cameraman taras protsyuk covering the war for reuters news agency - died from injuries sustained in the shelling .
reuters editor-in-chief geert linnebank said : " we are devastated by the death of taras , who had distinguished himself with his highly professional coverage in some of the most violent conflicts of the past decade . "
a reuters reporter and technician were also wounded in the attack .
david chater , a journalist with sky news reporting from the hotel said : " i noticed one of the tanks had its barrel pointed up at the building .

the only thing i know is that he 's losing power . "
" saddam hussein will be gone .
it might have been yesterday , i do n't know , " bush added .
u.s. troops under attack meanwhile , on the streets of baghdad , the initial euphoria surrounding the sight of u.s. troops calmly strolling around a number of captured presidential palaces on monday was replaced by the grim reality of brutal urban warfare .
as a10 and f-14 fighter jets set about decimating iraqi units in the center of the capital from first light on tuesday , troops from the u.s. army 's 3rd infantry , who had remained in the city overnight , found themselves under intense counterattack as morning dawned in baghdad .
fierce machine gun , rocket and mortar attacks rocked the main presidential compound as iraqi troops attempted to regain control of the palace grounds .
four u.s. abrams tanks defending the captured compound returned continuous heavy fire as armored vehicles advanced towards the iraqi positions , with low-flying u.s. war planes provided air support .
heavy fighting was also reported across the river , on the east bank of the tigris , where a firefight between a u.s. armored unit and iraqi forces was raging around a central baghdad high-rise building , until recently used by one of iraq 's deputy prime ministers .
coalition casualties mount in baghdad battles elsewhere , coalition forces continued to encounter scattered resistance in and around baghdad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy fighting is claiming casualties on both sides .
the u.s. 7th marines division , slowly but surely gaining ground in the southeastern suburbs of the city , met with iraqi small-arms fire as it pushed farther into baghdad on tuesday .

speaking at a joint press conference with british prime minister tony blair at their war summit in belfast , u.s. president george w. bush said : " i do n't know whether -lrb- saddam -rrb- survived .

" saddam hussein will be gone .
it might have been yesterday , i do n't know , " bush added .
u.s. troops under attack meanwhile , on the streets of baghdad , the initial euphoria surrounding the sight of u.s. troops calmly strolling around a number of captured presidential palaces on monday was replaced by the grim reality of brutal urban warfare .

fierce machine gun , rocket and mortar attacks rocked the main presidential compound as iraqi troops attempted to regain control of the palace grounds .
four u.s. abrams tanks defending the captured compound returned continuous heavy fire as armored vehicles advanced towards the iraqi positions , with low-flying u.s. war planes provided air support .
heavy fighting was also reported across the river , on the east bank of the tigris , where a firefight between a u.s. armored unit and iraqi forces was raging around a central baghdad high-rise building , until recently used by one of iraq 's deputy prime ministers .
coalition casualties mount in baghdad battles elsewhere , coalition forces continued to encounter scattered resistance in and around baghdad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy fighting is claiming casualties on both sides .
the u.s. 7th marines division , slowly but surely gaining ground in the southeastern suburbs of the city , met with iraqi small-arms fire as it pushed farther into baghdad on tuesday .
in the west , ground troops were involved in heavy fighting as they moved towards the heart of the capital .
on the city 's eastern front , two u.s. soldiers were killed as the 3rd battalion , 4th marines approached the capital under sustained iraqi mortar and artillery fire while attempting to secure a bridge over a canal near the tigris river on the southeastern outskirts .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for the u.n. to be given a central role in the country 's postwar administration , and two leading members of schröder 's party , the social democrats , reiterated that demand in a radio interviews on tuesday with german public radio .
" when it is not possible to create a major role for the united nations , the chances of creating peace in the region are much smaller , " said gernot erler , a leading social democrat in the german parliament .
erler said the united states and britain were unqualified to lead the effort because the iraqi people did not view them as liberators .
" therefore , someone who is considered to be neutral must be given the authority over the future organization , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul developmental minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the united nations not only should supply humanitarian aid but also should oversee the reconstruction of the country .
" the people who started the war are the ones responsible for providing the financial assistance , " wieczorek-zeul said .
arab council backs u.n. as well support for the united nations extends beyond germany .
the six members of the gulf cooperation council called on monday for the united nations to help the iraqis reorganize their government .
the council members " reaffirm that it is important for iraqis to run all the affairs of their country , " said abdulrahman al-attiyah , secretary-general of the loose political and economic alliance , at the end of a meeting of gcc foreign ministers .
in addition , u.n. general-secretary kofi annan will begin a trip to europe on wednesday to push the case for the united nations .
annan will meet with blair on wednesday before traveling to three countries that led the fight against the war - france , germany and russia .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the united nations , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for the u.n. to be given a central role in the country 's postwar administration , and two leading members of schröder 's party , the social democrats , reiterated that demand in a radio interviews on tuesday with german public radio .
" when it is not possible to create a major role for the united nations , the chances of creating peace in the region are much smaller , " said gernot erler , a leading social democrat in the german parliament .
erler said the united states and britain were unqualified to lead the effort because the iraqi people did not view them as liberators .
" therefore , someone who is considered to be neutral must be given the authority over the future organization , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul developmental minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the united nations not only should supply humanitarian aid but also should oversee the reconstruction of the country .
" the people who started the war are the ones responsible for providing the financial assistance , " wieczorek-zeul said .
arab council backs u.n. as well support for the united nations extends beyond germany .
the six members of the gulf cooperation council called on monday for the united nations to help the iraqis reorganize their government .
the council members " reaffirm that it is important for iraqis to run all the affairs of their country , " said abdulrahman al-attiyah , secretary-general of the loose political and economic alliance , at the end of a meeting of gcc foreign ministers .
in addition , u.n. general-secretary kofi annan will begin a trip to europe on wednesday to push the case for the united nations .
annan will meet with blair on wednesday before traveling to three countries that led the fight against the war - france , germany and russia .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the united nations , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .

following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .
with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .
at the same time , she stressed it was important for brussels to take over responsibility for europe-wide public health policy if epidemics in future were to be tackled effectively and for consistent health standards throughout the eu .
otherwise , roth-behrendt said , the body proposed by byrne would be in danger of being nothing more than a mere " alibi center .

sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .

unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .

following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .

the palestine hotel , where much of the foreign media is based , was suddenly turned into a scene of devastaion and confusion as the tank round hit the 15th floor of the building .
television pictures from the scene showed the bodies of the injured journalists being hurriedly carried through the lobby of the hotel while other reporters , visibly shaken , ran for cover clutching their equipment .
journalist and cameraman killed two cameramen - jose couso , working for spain 's telecinco and ukrainian cameraman taras protsyuk covering the war for reuters news agency - died from injuries sustained in the shelling .
reuters editor-in-chief geert linnebank said : " we are devastated by the death of taras , who had distinguished himself with his highly professional coverage in some of the most violent conflicts of the past decade . "
a reuters reporter and technician were also wounded in the attack .
david chater , a journalist with sky news reporting from the hotel said : " i noticed one of the tanks had its barrel pointed up at the building .
we went inside ... and there was an almighty crash , a huge explosion that shook the hotel . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tank fire in baghdad .
u.s. military officials expressed regret at the incident , saying one of their tanks had responsed to incoming sniper and rocket fire fired from the hotel .
" a tank was receiving small arms fire ... from the hotel and engaged the target with one tank round , " said general buford blount , commander of the u.s. 3rd infantry division in baghdad .
in a separate incident , a correspondent from the qatar-based al-jazeera network was killed and a colleague was hurt when at least one us missile hit the station 's baghdad office .
a journalist from the spanish newspaper el mundo and a german journalist with the news magazine focus were killed on monday when an iraqi missile struck the u.s. army camp in south of baghdad where they were sheltering .
both sides in the iraq war have been condemned for the deaths of reporters by the international federation of journalists , which represents hundreds of thousands of journalists around the world .
twelve foreign journalists have died in iraq since the start of the war , and two are missing .
decapitation attack targets saddam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a b1-b bomber .
meanwhile , the coalition offensive in the capital continues after a second " decapitation attack " intended to kill president saddam hussein and at least one of his sons was mounted in a residential area of the city.acting on what military sources referred to as " time-sensitive intelligence , " a single u.s. b1-b bomber swooped out of the blackened sky over baghdad on monday to target what was believed to be the latest sanctuary sought by the dictator and his sons qusay and uday .
dropping its payload of four precision-guided jdam bombs , weighing 907 kilograms -lrb- 2,000 pounds -rrb- each , the building in the mansour neighborhood of the capital was reduced to smoldering rubble at around 2 p.m. local time .
" there is a big hole where that target used to be , " said one u.s. official .
however , the attack also severely damaged a restaurant and surrounding apartments with reports circulating that at least nine people were killed and 13 others wounded , mainly civilians .
there were no confirmed killings of top iraqi officials despite high optimism amongst u.s. intelligence officials that the building housed the iraqi president and his sons as well as high-ranking military figures at the time of the strike .
a senior administration official in washington said the strike was " very much the same " as the initial " decapitation attack " that began the war .
speaking at a joint press conference with british prime minister tony blair at their war summit in belfast , u.s. president george w. bush said : " i do n't know whether -lrb- saddam -rrb- survived .
the only thing i know is that he 's losing power . "
" saddam hussein will be gone .
it might have been yesterday , i do n't know , " bush added .
u.s. troops under attack meanwhile , on the streets of baghdad , the initial euphoria surrounding the sight of u.s. troops calmly strolling around a number of captured presidential palaces on monday was replaced by the grim reality of brutal urban warfare .
as a10 and f-14 fighter jets set about decimating iraqi units in the center of the capital from first light on tuesday , troops from the u.s. army 's 3rd infantry , who had remained in the city overnight , found themselves under intense counterattack as morning dawned in baghdad .
fierce machine gun , rocket and mortar attacks rocked the main presidential compound as iraqi troops attempted to regain control of the palace grounds .
four u.s. abrams tanks defending the captured compound returned continuous heavy fire as armored vehicles advanced towards the iraqi positions , with low-flying u.s. war planes provided air support .
heavy fighting was also reported across the river , on the east bank of the tigris , where a firefight between a u.s. armored unit and iraqi forces was raging around a central baghdad high-rise building , until recently used by one of iraq 's deputy prime ministers .
coalition casualties mount in baghdad battles elsewhere , coalition forces continued to encounter scattered resistance in and around baghdad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy fighting is claiming casualties on both sides .
the u.s. 7th marines division , slowly but surely gaining ground in the southeastern suburbs of the city , met with iraqi small-arms fire as it pushed farther into baghdad on tuesday .
in the west , ground troops were involved in heavy fighting as they moved towards the heart of the capital .
on the city 's eastern front , two u.s. soldiers were killed as the 3rd battalion , 4th marines approached the capital under sustained iraqi mortar and artillery fire while attempting to secure a bridge over a canal near the tigris river on the southeastern outskirts .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for the u.n. to be given a central role in the country 's postwar administration , and two leading members of schröder 's party , the social democrats , reiterated that demand in a radio interviews on tuesday with german public radio .

the palestine hotel , where much of the foreign media is based , was suddenly turned into a scene of devastaion and confusion as the tank round hit the 15th floor of the building .

as a10 and f-14 fighter jets set about decimating iraqi units in the center of the capital from first light on tuesday , troops from the u.s. army 's 3rd infantry , who had remained in the city overnight , found themselves under intense counterattack as morning dawned in baghdad .
fierce machine gun , rocket and mortar attacks rocked the main presidential compound as iraqi troops attempted to regain control of the palace grounds .

following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .
with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .
at the same time , she stressed it was important for brussels to take over responsibility for europe-wide public health policy if epidemics in future were to be tackled effectively and for consistent health standards throughout the eu .
otherwise , roth-behrendt said , the body proposed by byrne would be in danger of being nothing more than a mere " alibi center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2003 protecting europe from future sars-like epidemics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of sars - a woman wearing a surgical mask in hong kong .
following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .
with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .
at the same time , she stressed it was important for brussels to take over responsibility for europe-wide public health policy if epidemics in future were to be tackled effectively and for consistent health standards throughout the eu .
otherwise , roth-behrendt said , the body proposed by byrne would be in danger of being nothing more than a mere " alibi center .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .

following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .
with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .
at the same time , she stressed it was important for brussels to take over responsibility for europe-wide public health policy if epidemics in future were to be tackled effectively and for consistent health standards throughout the eu .
otherwise , roth-behrendt said , the body proposed by byrne would be in danger of being nothing more than a mere " alibi center .

the palestine hotel , where much of the foreign media is based , was suddenly turned into a scene of devastaion and confusion as the tank round hit the 15th floor of the building .
television pictures from the scene showed the bodies of the injured journalists being hurriedly carried through the lobby of the hotel while other reporters , visibly shaken , ran for cover clutching their equipment .
journalist and cameraman killed two cameramen - jose couso , working for spain 's telecinco and ukrainian cameraman taras protsyuk covering the war for reuters news agency - died from injuries sustained in the shelling .
reuters editor-in-chief geert linnebank said : " we are devastated by the death of taras , who had distinguished himself with his highly professional coverage in some of the most violent conflicts of the past decade . "
a reuters reporter and technician were also wounded in the attack .
david chater , a journalist with sky news reporting from the hotel said : " i noticed one of the tanks had its barrel pointed up at the building .
we went inside ... and there was an almighty crash , a huge explosion that shook the hotel . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tank fire in baghdad .
u.s. military officials expressed regret at the incident , saying one of their tanks had responsed to incoming sniper and rocket fire fired from the hotel .
" a tank was receiving small arms fire ... from the hotel and engaged the target with one tank round , " said general buford blount , commander of the u.s. 3rd infantry division in baghdad .
in a separate incident , a correspondent from the qatar-based al-jazeera network was killed and a colleague was hurt when at least one us missile hit the station 's baghdad office .
a journalist from the spanish newspaper el mundo and a german journalist with the news magazine focus were killed on monday when an iraqi missile struck the u.s. army camp in south of baghdad where they were sheltering .
both sides in the iraq war have been condemned for the deaths of reporters by the international federation of journalists , which represents hundreds of thousands of journalists around the world .
twelve foreign journalists have died in iraq since the start of the war , and two are missing .
decapitation attack targets saddam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a b1-b bomber .
meanwhile , the coalition offensive in the capital continues after a second " decapitation attack " intended to kill president saddam hussein and at least one of his sons was mounted in a residential area of the city.acting on what military sources referred to as " time-sensitive intelligence , " a single u.s. b1-b bomber swooped out of the blackened sky over baghdad on monday to target what was believed to be the latest sanctuary sought by the dictator and his sons qusay and uday .
dropping its payload of four precision-guided jdam bombs , weighing 907 kilograms -lrb- 2,000 pounds -rrb- each , the building in the mansour neighborhood of the capital was reduced to smoldering rubble at around 2 p.m. local time .
" there is a big hole where that target used to be , " said one u.s. official .
however , the attack also severely damaged a restaurant and surrounding apartments with reports circulating that at least nine people were killed and 13 others wounded , mainly civilians .
there were no confirmed killings of top iraqi officials despite high optimism amongst u.s. intelligence officials that the building housed the iraqi president and his sons as well as high-ranking military figures at the time of the strike .
a senior administration official in washington said the strike was " very much the same " as the initial " decapitation attack " that began the war .
speaking at a joint press conference with british prime minister tony blair at their war summit in belfast , u.s. president george w. bush said : " i do n't know whether -lrb- saddam -rrb- survived .
the only thing i know is that he 's losing power . "
" saddam hussein will be gone .
it might have been yesterday , i do n't know , " bush added .
u.s. troops under attack meanwhile , on the streets of baghdad , the initial euphoria surrounding the sight of u.s. troops calmly strolling around a number of captured presidential palaces on monday was replaced by the grim reality of brutal urban warfare .
as a10 and f-14 fighter jets set about decimating iraqi units in the center of the capital from first light on tuesday , troops from the u.s. army 's 3rd infantry , who had remained in the city overnight , found themselves under intense counterattack as morning dawned in baghdad .
fierce machine gun , rocket and mortar attacks rocked the main presidential compound as iraqi troops attempted to regain control of the palace grounds .
four u.s. abrams tanks defending the captured compound returned continuous heavy fire as armored vehicles advanced towards the iraqi positions , with low-flying u.s. war planes provided air support .
heavy fighting was also reported across the river , on the east bank of the tigris , where a firefight between a u.s. armored unit and iraqi forces was raging around a central baghdad high-rise building , until recently used by one of iraq 's deputy prime ministers .
coalition casualties mount in baghdad battles elsewhere , coalition forces continued to encounter scattered resistance in and around baghdad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy fighting is claiming casualties on both sides .
the u.s. 7th marines division , slowly but surely gaining ground in the southeastern suburbs of the city , met with iraqi small-arms fire as it pushed farther into baghdad on tuesday .
in the west , ground troops were involved in heavy fighting as they moved towards the heart of the capital .
on the city 's eastern front , two u.s. soldiers were killed as the 3rd battalion , 4th marines approached the capital under sustained iraqi mortar and artillery fire while attempting to secure a bridge over a canal near the tigris river on the southeastern outskirts .

with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .
at the same time , she stressed it was important for brussels to take over responsibility for europe-wide public health policy if epidemics in future were to be tackled effectively and for consistent health standards throughout the eu .
otherwise , roth-behrendt said , the body proposed by byrne would be in danger of being nothing more than a mere " alibi center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2003 bush , blair endorse postwar role for u.n. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setting the course : u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- left -rrb- and british prime minister tony blair amid widespread calls for a strong u.n. role in postwar iraq , notably from germany , u.s. president bush and british prime minister blair endorsed a " vital role " for the u.n. when fighting ends . british prime minister tony blair is in no mood for diplomatic reruns .
before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for the u.n. to be given a central role in the country 's postwar administration , and two leading members of schröder 's party , the social democrats , reiterated that demand in a radio interviews on tuesday with german public radio .
" when it is not possible to create a major role for the united nations , the chances of creating peace in the region are much smaller , " said gernot erler , a leading social democrat in the german parliament .
erler said the united states and britain were unqualified to lead the effort because the iraqi people did not view them as liberators .
" therefore , someone who is considered to be neutral must be given the authority over the future organization , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul developmental minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the united nations not only should supply humanitarian aid but also should oversee the reconstruction of the country .
" the people who started the war are the ones responsible for providing the financial assistance , " wieczorek-zeul said .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for the u.n. to be given a central role in the country 's postwar administration , and two leading members of schröder 's party , the social democrats , reiterated that demand in a radio interviews on tuesday with german public radio .
" when it is not possible to create a major role for the united nations , the chances of creating peace in the region are much smaller , " said gernot erler , a leading social democrat in the german parliament .
erler said the united states and britain were unqualified to lead the effort because the iraqi people did not view them as liberators .
" therefore , someone who is considered to be neutral must be given the authority over the future organization , " he said .

the palestine hotel , where much of the foreign media is based , was suddenly turned into a scene of devastaion and confusion as the tank round hit the 15th floor of the building .
television pictures from the scene showed the bodies of the injured journalists being hurriedly carried through the lobby of the hotel while other reporters , visibly shaken , ran for cover clutching their equipment .
journalist and cameraman killed two cameramen - jose couso , working for spain 's telecinco and ukrainian cameraman taras protsyuk covering the war for reuters news agency - died from injuries sustained in the shelling .
reuters editor-in-chief geert linnebank said : " we are devastated by the death of taras , who had distinguished himself with his highly professional coverage in some of the most violent conflicts of the past decade . "
a reuters reporter and technician were also wounded in the attack .
david chater , a journalist with sky news reporting from the hotel said : " i noticed one of the tanks had its barrel pointed up at the building .
we went inside ... and there was an almighty crash , a huge explosion that shook the hotel . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tank fire in baghdad .
u.s. military officials expressed regret at the incident , saying one of their tanks had responsed to incoming sniper and rocket fire fired from the hotel .
" a tank was receiving small arms fire ... from the hotel and engaged the target with one tank round , " said general buford blount , commander of the u.s. 3rd infantry division in baghdad .
in a separate incident , a correspondent from the qatar-based al-jazeera network was killed and a colleague was hurt when at least one us missile hit the station 's baghdad office .
a journalist from the spanish newspaper el mundo and a german journalist with the news magazine focus were killed on monday when an iraqi missile struck the u.s. army camp in south of baghdad where they were sheltering .
both sides in the iraq war have been condemned for the deaths of reporters by the international federation of journalists , which represents hundreds of thousands of journalists around the world .
twelve foreign journalists have died in iraq since the start of the war , and two are missing .
decapitation attack targets saddam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a b1-b bomber .
meanwhile , the coalition offensive in the capital continues after a second " decapitation attack " intended to kill president saddam hussein and at least one of his sons was mounted in a residential area of the city.acting on what military sources referred to as " time-sensitive intelligence , " a single u.s. b1-b bomber swooped out of the blackened sky over baghdad on monday to target what was believed to be the latest sanctuary sought by the dictator and his sons qusay and uday .
dropping its payload of four precision-guided jdam bombs , weighing 907 kilograms -lrb- 2,000 pounds -rrb- each , the building in the mansour neighborhood of the capital was reduced to smoldering rubble at around 2 p.m. local time .
" there is a big hole where that target used to be , " said one u.s. official .
however , the attack also severely damaged a restaurant and surrounding apartments with reports circulating that at least nine people were killed and 13 others wounded , mainly civilians .
there were no confirmed killings of top iraqi officials despite high optimism amongst u.s. intelligence officials that the building housed the iraqi president and his sons as well as high-ranking military figures at the time of the strike .
a senior administration official in washington said the strike was " very much the same " as the initial " decapitation attack " that began the war .
speaking at a joint press conference with british prime minister tony blair at their war summit in belfast , u.s. president george w. bush said : " i do n't know whether -lrb- saddam -rrb- survived .
the only thing i know is that he 's losing power . "
" saddam hussein will be gone .
it might have been yesterday , i do n't know , " bush added .
u.s. troops under attack meanwhile , on the streets of baghdad , the initial euphoria surrounding the sight of u.s. troops calmly strolling around a number of captured presidential palaces on monday was replaced by the grim reality of brutal urban warfare .
as a10 and f-14 fighter jets set about decimating iraqi units in the center of the capital from first light on tuesday , troops from the u.s. army 's 3rd infantry , who had remained in the city overnight , found themselves under intense counterattack as morning dawned in baghdad .
fierce machine gun , rocket and mortar attacks rocked the main presidential compound as iraqi troops attempted to regain control of the palace grounds .
four u.s. abrams tanks defending the captured compound returned continuous heavy fire as armored vehicles advanced towards the iraqi positions , with low-flying u.s. war planes provided air support .
heavy fighting was also reported across the river , on the east bank of the tigris , where a firefight between a u.s. armored unit and iraqi forces was raging around a central baghdad high-rise building , until recently used by one of iraq 's deputy prime ministers .
coalition casualties mount in baghdad battles elsewhere , coalition forces continued to encounter scattered resistance in and around baghdad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy fighting is claiming casualties on both sides .
the u.s. 7th marines division , slowly but surely gaining ground in the southeastern suburbs of the city , met with iraqi small-arms fire as it pushed farther into baghdad on tuesday .
in the west , ground troops were involved in heavy fighting as they moved towards the heart of the capital .

serbia has detained nearly 2,000 people in connection with the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic , and officials say many of them have confessed to their roles in the plot . it would take a new prison to house all of the suspects arrested by serb authorities in the hunt for the killer of prime minister zoran djindjic and the people behind the plot .
as part of the investigation launched after the march 12 sniper attack , police detained more than 7,000 people .
of these , nearly 2,000 are still in custody , creating the need to house some of the suspects in military prisons .
but such details are only of secondary importance to officials like the serbian interior minister , dusan mihajlovic , who are interested in finding those responsible for the killing .
and mihajlovic expressed his satisfaction this week about the progress police have made .
" all of the questions have been answered in connection with the assassination , " he said .
" we have the exact list of people who were part of the plot and the shooting . ...
what is more interesting : the majority have confessed to being part of the plot . "
shooting suspect in custody the people under arrest include the main shooting suspect , zvezdan jovanovic , who was an assistant commander of the police unit for special operations that fought in the balkan wars of the 1990s .
like many of the detained people , jovanovic is suspected of being a member of a belgrade-based criminal organization that controls the drug trade in and around the capital .
the group is known as the zemun gang , named after the district in belgrade where it is based .
police are still searching for one of its leaders , milorad lukovic , a former commander of the police unit .
the charismatic djindjic , who spearheaded the popular protests that brought down yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic in october 2000 , was mortally wounded by two sniper bullets as he entered government buildings in the capital , belgrade , on march 12 .
djindjic made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia left behind by milosevic .
his trade of milosevic in return for $ 1.2 billion in western aid packages enraged nationalists , including his one-time ally , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
their resulting feud paralyzed moves to implement economic and social reform , viewed by analysts as vital to the country 's future .
state of emergency declared djindjic also led efforts to establish democracy , and crack down on corruption and organized crime .

following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .
with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .
at the same time , she stressed it was important for brussels to take over responsibility for europe-wide public health policy if epidemics in future were to be tackled effectively and for consistent health standards throughout the eu .
otherwise , roth-behrendt said , the body proposed by byrne would be in danger of being nothing more than a mere " alibi center .

following the outbreak of the virulent sars virus , the european union plans to tighten its health structures by setting up a central authority to better coordinate european efforts in dealing with future epidemics . as sars or severe acute respiratory syndrome spreads its deadly bacteria around the world , health authorities have been jolted into taking emergency measures and precautions to limit the spread of the pneumonia-like illness .
with the death toll now estimated at over 100 and some 2,700 people worldwide believed to have contracted the illness , the european union is taking no chances .
eu issues travel warning speaking at the european parliament in strasbourg on monday , eu health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne urged eu citizens to avoid unnecessary trips to asia - especially ones with itineraries including china 's canton region and other areas where sars is known to have had a severe impact .
without specifically mentioning china 's response to the illness , which has been criticized by the international community , byrne hinted that spread of the potentially deadly virus could have been reduced if china had alerted the world to the disease earlier .
" earlier notifications to the who by those affected could have mitigated many of the effects , " he said .
" this is a key lesson for the future . "
sars was first detected in the southern chinese province of guangdong last november , but china only notified the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- of the new virus in mid-february this year .
about 43 people in the guangdong province alone are reported to have succumbed to the virus .
byrne : situation under control byrne emphasized that the eu had the deadly illness under control and that the situation in europe was stable .
" all 15 member states have together registered 46 cases of illness , 19 probable sars instances and 27 cases of suspicion , but no fatality as yet , " he said .
" it ’ s also important that till now there has been no local contraction of the disease within the european union . "
the eu ’ s top health official sought to assure members of parliament that the european commission was confident of tackling the highly-contagious ailment with its existing early warning and response system -lrb- ewrs -rrb- , which was first set up in 1999 .
ewrs belongs to the eu ’ s network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases .
the illness is believed to have spread to europe via airline passengers arriving from asia .
cases of sars infection have been reported in most major european countries , including germany , which has had five reported cases according to who , france , britain , spain , switzerland and italy .
multinational system required despite the eu ’ s insistence that it is well-equipped to deal with the health situation at hand , there is little doubt that if the illness developed into a full-fledged epidemic in europe , the eu ’ s existing health and safety structures would be insufficient for tackling the problem .
unlike its extensive defensive mechanisms for dealing with contagious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth or the plague , brussels has no corresponding framework in cases of human epidemics .
underscoring the importance of a coordinated effort to deal with easily-transmitted human epidemics , byrne said last month : " cases like sars demonstrate only too clearly that contagious diseases require a high level of preparedness across borders . "
central authority needed for consistency the commissioner is now pushing for the creation of a european center for disease prevention and control to coordinate eu member states ’ surveillance of and reaction to outbreaks of epidemics .
byrne said he hoped the agency would be up and running by 2005 .
" we need to establish a structure at european level that has the scope , the stability , and the capacity to respond to the threat from diseases in the longer term .
it -lrb- the center -rrb- would aim to enhance surveillance , coordinate common responses and collaborate with member states , candidate countries and international organizations such as the who , " byrne said .
the commissioner ’ s proposal is not new .
the european commission in brussels has tried for some time now to reinforce its health safety and prevention authorities with additional powers .
at the same time , byrne has stressed that the european center for disease prevention and control would not replace existing national health structures in member states .
the european center instead would be able to offer consistent travel information to all eu citizens , he said .
brussels should take leading role the consumer affairs spokeswoman for germany ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , dagmar roth-behrendt has welcomed byrne ’ s proposal .
at the same time , she stressed it was important for brussels to take over responsibility for europe-wide public health policy if epidemics in future were to be tackled effectively and for consistent health standards throughout the eu .
otherwise , roth-behrendt said , the body proposed by byrne would be in danger of being nothing more than a mere " alibi center .

before the united states-led coalition launched its invasion of iraq , blair found himself caught up in what he called " endless diplomatic wrangles " over his pro-war position and the anti-war position of some european allies .
on tuesday , he let those allies know that he did n't want to experience the same dogged negotiations when leaders try to shape the future of iraq and the role that the united nations may play in it .
at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "

" when it is not possible to create a major role for the united nations , the chances of creating peace in the region are much smaller , " said gernot erler , a leading social democrat in the german parliament .
erler said the united states and britain were unqualified to lead the effort because the iraqi people did not view them as liberators .
" therefore , someone who is considered to be neutral must be given the authority over the future organization , " he said .

at a joint press conference with u.s. president , bush at an 18th century castle near belfast , northern ireland on tuesday , the british premier urged the world to avoid diplomatic wrangling over iraq 's future like the bickering that preceded the war .
leaders pledge " vital role " both bush and blair endorsed a " vital role " for the united nations in iraq and called for world unity over the country when fighting ends .
london and washington hope their agreed vision of the postwar stages in iraq will placate france , germany and russia , and appease widespread international suspicion of u.s. motives in iraq .
" we are of course agreed , as we say in our joint statement , that there will be a vital role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq , " blair told a news conference at his summit with bush .
bush used the same words and added that he wanted iraq to move fast toward establishing an interim authority of iraqis .
" we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibilities under the control of an interim authority composed of iraqis from both inside and outside the country , " bush told the news conference .
" the interim authority will serve until a permanent government can be chosen by the iraqi people . "
president defines " vital role " pressed on what he meant by a " vital role , " bush replied : " i believe a vital role is as an agent to help people live freely .
" that means food .
that means medicine .
that means aid .
that means a place where people can give their contributions .
that means suggesting people for the interim iraqi authority .
that means being a party to the progress being made in iraq .
that 's what that means , " he said .
the british leader , who has stood by bush throughout the crisis , said the " new iraq " would be run by the iraqi people and not by britain , the united states or the united nations germans demand role for u.n. but it remains to be seen whether this time the british prime minister may get his wish because some of the same forces that tried to block the war are now pressing their case for a major u.n. role in the administration of postwar iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for the u.n. to be given a central role in the country 's postwar administration , and two leading members of schröder 's party , the social democrats , reiterated that demand in a radio interviews on tuesday with german public radio .
" when it is not possible to create a major role for the united nations , the chances of creating peace in the region are much smaller , " said gernot erler , a leading social democrat in the german parliament .
erler said the united states and britain were unqualified to lead the effort because the iraqi people did not view them as liberators .
" therefore , someone who is considered to be neutral must be given the authority over the future organization , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul developmental minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the united nations not only should supply humanitarian aid but also should oversee the reconstruction of the country .
" the people who started the war are the ones responsible for providing the financial assistance , " wieczorek-zeul said .
arab council backs u.n. as well support for the united nations extends beyond germany .
the six members of the gulf cooperation council called on monday for the united nations to help the iraqis reorganize their government .
the council members " reaffirm that it is important for iraqis to run all the affairs of their country , " said abdulrahman al-attiyah , secretary-general of the loose political and economic alliance , at the end of a meeting of gcc foreign ministers .
in addition , u.n. general-secretary kofi annan will begin a trip to europe on wednesday to push the case for the united nations .
annan will meet with blair on wednesday before traveling to three countries that led the fight against the war - france , germany and russia .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the united nations , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .

serbia has detained nearly 2,000 people in connection with the assassination of prime minister zoran djindjic , and officials say many of them have confessed to their roles in the plot . it would take a new prison to house all of the suspects arrested by serb authorities in the hunt for the killer of prime minister zoran djindjic and the people behind the plot .
as part of the investigation launched after the march 12 sniper attack , police detained more than 7,000 people .
of these , nearly 2,000 are still in custody , creating the need to house some of the suspects in military prisons .
but such details are only of secondary importance to officials like the serbian interior minister , dusan mihajlovic , who are interested in finding those responsible for the killing .
and mihajlovic expressed his satisfaction this week about the progress police have made .
" all of the questions have been answered in connection with the assassination , " he said .
" we have the exact list of people who were part of the plot and the shooting . ...
what is more interesting : the majority have confessed to being part of the plot . "
shooting suspect in custody the people under arrest include the main shooting suspect , zvezdan jovanovic , who was an assistant commander of the police unit for special operations that fought in the balkan wars of the 1990s .
like many of the detained people , jovanovic is suspected of being a member of a belgrade-based criminal organization that controls the drug trade in and around the capital .
the group is known as the zemun gang , named after the district in belgrade where it is based .
police are still searching for one of its leaders , milorad lukovic , a former commander of the police unit .
the charismatic djindjic , who spearheaded the popular protests that brought down yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic in october 2000 , was mortally wounded by two sniper bullets as he entered government buildings in the capital , belgrade , on march 12 .
djindjic made many enemies as he tried to transform the serbia left behind by milosevic .
his trade of milosevic in return for $ 1.2 billion in western aid packages enraged nationalists , including his one-time ally , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
their resulting feud paralyzed moves to implement economic and social reform , viewed by analysts as vital to the country 's future .
state of emergency declared djindjic also led efforts to establish democracy , and crack down on corruption and organized crime .
after his death , the government declared a state of emergency and gave police extra powers to hold suspects and raid houses .
serbia 's justice minister , vladan batic , has said he expected the first trials to be held in the fall .
and djindjic 's successor , zoran zivkovic , has said the state of emergency will be lifted in about three weeks if nothing serious happens . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia : a place where deadly crime is part of life serbian prime minister zoran djindjic lived and governed in a land of violent crime .

as part of the investigation launched after the march 12 sniper attack , police detained more than 7,000 people .
of these , nearly 2,000 are still in custody , creating the need to house some of the suspects in military prisons .
but such details are only of secondary importance to officials like the serbian interior minister , dusan mihajlovic , who are interested in finding those responsible for the killing .
and mihajlovic expressed his satisfaction this week about the progress police have made .

the birds have chosen to return to plymbridge woods , near plymouth , to nest - despite previous attempts on their lives and those of their chicks .
last year , thousands of people visited the woods to see the peregrines rear three young chicks .
and , unusually , the peregrines have returned to their nesting site at cann quarry , where they have laid an unknown number of eggs . "
we have a large group of people who are all rooting for the birds and are willing to put their time in to make sure they breed successfully " gus ferguson , national trust warden " it 's quite unusual they have come back to precisely the same spot as last year , " said reg fairburn , plymbridge peregrine warden .
" a peregrine falcon will usually pick a different nest site , but this year they 've come back to the exact same nest so they must feel particularly secure . "
and this year , for the first time , viewers on the internet will be able to keep watch on the nest via a live webcam .
once again the national trust , in conjunction with royal society for the protection of birds , has organised a 24-hour peregrine monitoring scheme .
a team of dedicated bird watchers is manning the viaduct overlooking the quarry with telescopes and binoculars , ensuring that the birds come to no harm .
" we have a large group of people who are all rooting for the birds and are willing to put their time in to make sure they breed successfully , " said national trust warden gus ferguson .
falcons nesting in the quarry have been poisoned in the past .
keen interest in 2000 , an adult female and two young chicks died after pigeons baited with an agricultural pesticide were left at the quarry .
the police suspected pigeon fanciers trying to protect their birds from becoming prey .
last year , about 5,000 people visited the quarry to see the birds at close quarters .
with an unknown number of eggs laid , bird watchers are already showing a keen interest .
" generally the incubation period is between 28 and 35 days , so we are expecting them to hatch in the first or second week of may , " said mr fairburn .

it 's not known whether saddam hussein was in the area at the time .
this morning , american troops have remained at their positions in the centre of baghdad - where a sustained battle is taking place .
machine gun fire and several large explosions have been heard around the us troops this morning .
us tanks in baghdad air marshal sir timothy garden has been analysing the latest developments on breakfast .
sir tim said that american troops are likely now to be targets as they stand their ground at a presidential palace in baghdad .
and they will continue to be vulnerable to iraqi fire - particularly as some iraqi troops are without any leadership .
they do need to discover where saddam and his immediate senior management are located - and they may be underground .
he said that the eventual aim of the troops would be to secure their hold in the city - but warned that that process would take time .
none of the city , he said , could be described as being under american control yet .

john peters said that technology had improved immensely since he served in the gulf .
bombs , he said , are getting smaller - the explosions do n't need to be so big because they 're hitting their targets more effectively than ever before .
former pow john peters even during the first gulf war though , john peters said that he saw for himself how accurate the bombs could be .
then , for example , an allied bomb was able to pick out a radio tower in the middle some apartment blocks .
now , he said he 's sure that the bombs are even more able to pick out the exact target that they want .

anne owers said just 37 % of detainees said they felt safe in the five centres examined in the new report .
in one , translation services were so bad that staff sang " happy birthday " to a new arrival to try to find out his date of birth .
inspectors criticised three centres as unsafe : haslar in gosport , hampshire ; campsfield house in kidlington , oxfordshire and lindholme in doncaster , south yorkshire .
some 12 % of asylum seekers at campsfield house complained of sexual harassment .
prison service detainees at haslar and lindholme were strip-searched without explanation , sometimes in front of others , inspectors said .
ms owers said : " a policy of regular and random strip-searching must be wrong for detainees .
" it should only be taking place with clear intelligence relating to specific individuals and on the authority of a senior centre manager . "
just one in 15 detainees at lindholme said they felt safe there , with the rate one in 10 at haslar .
both are run by the prison service .
' humiliating ' two other centres , tinsley house , near gatwick , and oakington in longstanton , cambridgeshire , which both house children and families , were not suitable for stays of anything more than a few days , said inspectors .
in all centres except oakington detainees were denied reliable information about why they were being held or the progress of their case .
at lindholme , " intimidation and hostility was present though not widespread " .
the attempt by staff there to sing to one man to find out his date of birth was " well meaning " but " disrespectful and humiliating for the detainee " .
' unsurprising ' the inspectors also found some detainees , who were awaiting deportation or for their claims to be processed , had been overcharged thousands of pounds by legal advisers .
the report is ms owers ' first under her new powers to inspect what are officially known as immigration removal centres .
home office minister beverley hughes said : " a large proportion of the findings reflect only the comments of the detainees themselves . "
" as people are generally unhappy about being detained and removed from the country it is unsurprising that they express dissatisfaction with their situation . "

anne owers said just 37 % of detainees said they felt safe in the five centres examined in the new report .
in one , translation services were so bad that staff sang " happy birthday " to a new arrival to try to find out his date of birth .
inspectors criticised three centres as unsafe : haslar in gosport , hampshire ; campsfield house in kidlington , oxfordshire and lindholme in doncaster , south yorkshire .
some 12 % of asylum seekers at campsfield house complained of sexual harassment .
prison service detainees at haslar and lindholme were strip-searched without explanation , sometimes in front of others , inspectors said .
ms owers said : " a policy of regular and random strip-searching must be wrong for detainees .
" it should only be taking place with clear intelligence relating to specific individuals and on the authority of a senior centre manager . "
just one in 15 detainees at lindholme said they felt safe there , with the rate one in 10 at haslar .
both are run by the prison service .
' humiliating ' two other centres , tinsley house , near gatwick , and oakington in longstanton , cambridgeshire , which both house children and families , were not suitable for stays of anything more than a few days , said inspectors .
in all centres except oakington detainees were denied reliable information about why they were being held or the progress of their case .
at lindholme , " intimidation and hostility was present though not widespread " .
the attempt by staff there to sing to one man to find out his date of birth was " well meaning " but " disrespectful and humiliating for the detainee " .
' unsurprising ' the inspectors also found some detainees , who were awaiting deportation or for their claims to be processed , had been overcharged thousands of pounds by legal advisers .
the report is ms owers ' first under her new powers to inspect what are officially known as immigration removal centres .
home office minister beverley hughes said : " a large proportion of the findings reflect only the comments of the detainees themselves . "
" as people are generally unhappy about being detained and removed from the country it is unsurprising that they express dissatisfaction with their situation . "
