as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .
11 attacks , and u.s. intelligence offices have long been piling pressure on non-u.s. carriers to follow suit , fining those who refused to pass on passenger data some € 4,900 -lrb- $ 6,000 -rrb- per head .
negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .
the european commission also said the agreement would set a framework for airlines to pass on data to non-u.s. authorities , adding that the eu was also considering seeking greater access to american passengers ' data . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and germany pledge to intensify security cooperation the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some girls have been expelled for wearing headscarves in french schools current laws on the subject are vague and have led to several cases of girls being expelled from schools for wearing headscarves .
schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .
a poll published by le parisien newspaper on wednesday put public opinion behind the ban , showing that 69 percent of french citizens would support that law , compared with 55 percent who said they would back such a move prior to the publication of the expert commission report .
but according to the same poll , only 39 percent of french muslims favor the ban .
germany tackles a similar issue the headscarves debate has become a recurring issue in germany over the past months as well .
earlier this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in the southern city of stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that although germany ’ s constitution did not forbid the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools , individual states could impose such a ban if they wished . since the ruling , the german states of bavaria and baden-württemberg have drafted bills which , if passed , would prohibit teachers in state-funded schools from wearing headscarves .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .
schmitt has proposed the introduction of a counterweight for lighter athletes and the introduction of shorter skis while the heavier jumpers would have longer ones . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hesitant hero sunday 's victory is only the latest for olympic ski jumping champion sven hannawald , who has transformed himself in one year from an uncertain athlete with a penchant for injury into a legend .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .
11 attacks , and u.s. intelligence offices have long been piling pressure on non-u.s. carriers to follow suit , fining those who refused to pass on passenger data some € 4,900 -lrb- $ 6,000 -rrb- per head .
negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .
the european commission also said the agreement would set a framework for airlines to pass on data to non-u.s. authorities , adding that the eu was also considering seeking greater access to american passengers ' data . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and germany pledge to intensify security cooperation the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .
11 attacks , and u.s. intelligence offices have long been piling pressure on non-u.s. carriers to follow suit , fining those who refused to pass on passenger data some € 4,900 -lrb- $ 6,000 -rrb- per head .
negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .
the european commission also said the agreement would set a framework for airlines to pass on data to non-u.s. authorities , adding that the eu was also considering seeking greater access to american passengers ' data . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and germany pledge to intensify security cooperation the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .
meanwhile , the pentagon announced that it had delayed the bidding conference for reconstruction contracts in iraq until early january .
companies were supposed to begin entering their bids at the end of this week .
there was no reason given for the delay . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush discusses iraq contract row with european leaders u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .

pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness .

the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.12.2003 german ski jumpers face starvation claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter than air : are german ski jumpers anorexic ?
after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some girls have been expelled for wearing headscarves in french schools current laws on the subject are vague and have led to several cases of girls being expelled from schools for wearing headscarves .
schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .
a poll published by le parisien newspaper on wednesday put public opinion behind the ban , showing that 69 percent of french citizens would support that law , compared with 55 percent who said they would back such a move prior to the publication of the expert commission report .
but according to the same poll , only 39 percent of french muslims favor the ban .
germany tackles a similar issue the headscarves debate has become a recurring issue in germany over the past months as well .
earlier this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in the southern city of stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that although germany ’ s constitution did not forbid the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools , individual states could impose such a ban if they wished . since the ruling , the german states of bavaria and baden-württemberg have drafted bills which , if passed , would prohibit teachers in state-funded schools from wearing headscarves .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .
meanwhile , the pentagon announced that it had delayed the bidding conference for reconstruction contracts in iraq until early january .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .
meanwhile , the pentagon announced that it had delayed the bidding conference for reconstruction contracts in iraq until early january .
companies were supposed to begin entering their bids at the end of this week .
there was no reason given for the delay . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush discusses iraq contract row with european leaders u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .

negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .
" they are important to change the culture of secrecy that dominates iraqi society and prevent self-interest groups from presenting a black-and-white picture of history .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .
" they are important to change the culture of secrecy that dominates iraqi society and prevent self-interest groups from presenting a black-and-white picture of history . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .
the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some girls have been expelled for wearing headscarves in french schools current laws on the subject are vague and have led to several cases of girls being expelled from schools for wearing headscarves .
schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .
a poll published by le parisien newspaper on wednesday put public opinion behind the ban , showing that 69 percent of french citizens would support that law , compared with 55 percent who said they would back such a move prior to the publication of the expert commission report .
but according to the same poll , only 39 percent of french muslims favor the ban .
germany tackles a similar issue the headscarves debate has become a recurring issue in germany over the past months as well .
earlier this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in the southern city of stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that although germany ’ s constitution did not forbid the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools , individual states could impose such a ban if they wished . since the ruling , the german states of bavaria and baden-württemberg have drafted bills which , if passed , would prohibit teachers in state-funded schools from wearing headscarves .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .
schmitt has proposed the introduction of a counterweight for lighter athletes and the introduction of shorter skis while the heavier jumpers would have longer ones . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hesitant hero sunday 's victory is only the latest for olympic ski jumping champion sven hannawald , who has transformed himself in one year from an uncertain athlete with a penchant for injury into a legend .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .
meanwhile , the pentagon announced that it had delayed the bidding conference for reconstruction contracts in iraq until early january .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.12.2003 germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of germany 's stasi archive could serve as a model for iraqi leaders .
the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .
" they are important to change the culture of secrecy that dominates iraqi society and prevent self-interest groups from presenting a black-and-white picture of history .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness .

the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .

the german government ’ s plans to raise money to finance tax cuts in 2004 could include the sale of state-owned deutsche telekom and deutsche post shares plus the privatization of other interests . german shareholders of deutsche telekom and deutsche post face having the value of their stock slashed if hans eichel , the federal finance minister , has his way in the sweeping tax reforms recently agreed upon in the german parliament . the mediation committee made up of ruling coalition and opposition members of germany 's two legislative chambers , the bundesrat and the bundestag , came to an agreement earlier this week that a total of € 3.3 billion could be generated for the financing of tax relief measures . stock market observers believe the funding wíll come from the sale of a percentage of state-owned telekom and post stocks and the privatization of federal interests in the frankfurt , cologne / bonn and munich airports and the harbor at duisburg .
such sales would contribute towards the financing of the german government ’ s proposed € 7.8 billion package of tax cuts planned for next year . state-owned shares destined for market ? as part of its plan , the government could put telekom stocks worth a total of € 2.3 billion up for sale , in addition to the € 5.5 billion which were “ parked ” with the state-owned development bank kfw in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post shareholders will also suffer .
when these shares eventually make it to market , the effects of such a huge sale on the value of telekom and post shares will be one of widespread dilution .
with so many shares available for sale , the supply and demand ratio would lower the price of all stock , which would spell bad news for company shareholders . effects already being felt " the threat that stocks are going to be put on the market always affects them in a negative way , " said henning gebhardt , at the frankfurt investment fund society dws , in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper .
marcus sander , a telecommunications expert with investment bank sal oppenheim , added in the same article that news of the expected stock sales had already put " a brake on telekom shares . " the government ’ s stake in deutsche telekom , owned through kfw , is worth about € 25 billion at the current market price while its stake in deutsche post is worth around € 11 billion . parking would generate instant cash government sources quoted in the berliner zeitung suggested that the sale of the shares would be done carefully and at the right time , presumably when the market climate was more favorable .
the stocks would more than likely be sold to the kfw bank first rather than directly onto the market , generating cash flow for the government immediately , and then held in trust until the time was right for them to be sold openly . any sales from the airport and harbor privatization action would be placed directly on the market and not parked at the kfw , a government source told the financial news wire dow jones . more privatization to come it was a widely known fact within governmental circles that eichel had already planned to introduce the privatization measures and the generation of funds through the sale of telekom and post stocks in the federal budget before the arrangement was agreed in the mediation committee .
he has since stated that he wants to make further cuts in state participation in the most valuable sectors in 2004 , which could raise an extra € 7 billion and bring the funding to around € 10.3 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german reform deal set for approval germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .
11 attacks , and u.s. intelligence offices have long been piling pressure on non-u.s. carriers to follow suit , fining those who refused to pass on passenger data some € 4,900 -lrb- $ 6,000 -rrb- per head .
negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.12.2003 german ski jumpers face starvation claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter than air : are german ski jumpers anorexic ?
after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .
schmitt has proposed the introduction of a counterweight for lighter athletes and the introduction of shorter skis while the heavier jumpers would have longer ones . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hesitant hero sunday 's victory is only the latest for olympic ski jumping champion sven hannawald , who has transformed himself in one year from an uncertain athlete with a penchant for injury into a legend .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .

it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .
schmitt has proposed the introduction of a counterweight for lighter athletes and the introduction of shorter skis while the heavier jumpers would have longer ones . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hesitant hero sunday 's victory is only the latest for olympic ski jumping champion sven hannawald , who has transformed himself in one year from an uncertain athlete with a penchant for injury into a legend .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some girls have been expelled for wearing headscarves in french schools current laws on the subject are vague and have led to several cases of girls being expelled from schools for wearing headscarves .
schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .
a poll published by le parisien newspaper on wednesday put public opinion behind the ban , showing that 69 percent of french citizens would support that law , compared with 55 percent who said they would back such a move prior to the publication of the expert commission report .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some girls have been expelled for wearing headscarves in french schools current laws on the subject are vague and have led to several cases of girls being expelled from schools for wearing headscarves .
schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.12.2003 germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of germany 's stasi archive could serve as a model for iraqi leaders .
the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .
" they are important to change the culture of secrecy that dominates iraqi society and prevent self-interest groups from presenting a black-and-white picture of history .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .

negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .
the european commission also said the agreement would set a framework for airlines to pass on data to non-u.s. authorities , adding that the eu was also considering seeking greater access to american passengers ' data . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and germany pledge to intensify security cooperation the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .
11 attacks , and u.s. intelligence offices have long been piling pressure on non-u.s. carriers to follow suit , fining those who refused to pass on passenger data some € 4,900 -lrb- $ 6,000 -rrb- per head .
negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .

the company , which aimed to bring together amateur athletes from the 87,000 sporting groups affiliated with the german sports federation -lrb- dsb -rrb- , went bust only a few months after it launched amid a blitz of publicity in summer 2001 . more briefs 17.12.2003 -pipe- u.s. firm bids for german chemical company celanese 17.12.2003 -pipe- german companies worried about their money in iraq 17.12.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler trial suspended amid new evidence 17.12.2003 -pipe- dollar slide may hit bundesbank profits 16.12.2003 -pipe- microsoft removes offending swastika 16.12.2003 -pipe- ig metall rejects longer work week 16.12.2003 -pipe- deutsche bank wins industry “ oscar ” 16.12.2003 -pipe- german christmas sales falling flat radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .

martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .
11 attacks , and u.s. intelligence offices have long been piling pressure on non-u.s. carriers to follow suit , fining those who refused to pass on passenger data some € 4,900 -lrb- $ 6,000 -rrb- per head .
negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .
the european commission also said the agreement would set a framework for airlines to pass on data to non-u.s. authorities , adding that the eu was also considering seeking greater access to american passengers ' data . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and germany pledge to intensify security cooperation the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .

the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .
11 attacks , and u.s. intelligence offices have long been piling pressure on non-u.s. carriers to follow suit , fining those who refused to pass on passenger data some € 4,900 -lrb- $ 6,000 -rrb- per head .
negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .
the european commission also said the agreement would set a framework for airlines to pass on data to non-u.s. authorities , adding that the eu was also considering seeking greater access to american passengers ' data . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and germany pledge to intensify security cooperation the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.12.2003 german ski jumpers face starvation claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter than air : are german ski jumpers anorexic ?
after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .
schmitt has proposed the introduction of a counterweight for lighter athletes and the introduction of shorter skis while the heavier jumpers would have longer ones . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hesitant hero sunday 's victory is only the latest for olympic ski jumping champion sven hannawald , who has transformed himself in one year from an uncertain athlete with a penchant for injury into a legend .

executives of sportgate , a once high-flying internet sports portal majority owned by the former tennis champ , said becker had issued a written agreement pledging to invest an additional € 1.5 million in the company to help buffer its losses .
but on thursday , the court said the deal would only have been valid if sportgate had requested the money from becker before it filed for insolvency in august 2001 .

the german government ’ s plans to raise money to finance tax cuts in 2004 could include the sale of state-owned deutsche telekom and deutsche post shares plus the privatization of other interests . german shareholders of deutsche telekom and deutsche post face having the value of their stock slashed if hans eichel , the federal finance minister , has his way in the sweeping tax reforms recently agreed upon in the german parliament . the mediation committee made up of ruling coalition and opposition members of germany 's two legislative chambers , the bundesrat and the bundestag , came to an agreement earlier this week that a total of € 3.3 billion could be generated for the financing of tax relief measures . stock market observers believe the funding wíll come from the sale of a percentage of state-owned telekom and post stocks and the privatization of federal interests in the frankfurt , cologne / bonn and munich airports and the harbor at duisburg .
such sales would contribute towards the financing of the german government ’ s proposed € 7.8 billion package of tax cuts planned for next year . state-owned shares destined for market ? as part of its plan , the government could put telekom stocks worth a total of € 2.3 billion up for sale , in addition to the € 5.5 billion which were “ parked ” with the state-owned development bank kfw in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post shareholders will also suffer .
when these shares eventually make it to market , the effects of such a huge sale on the value of telekom and post shares will be one of widespread dilution .
with so many shares available for sale , the supply and demand ratio would lower the price of all stock , which would spell bad news for company shareholders . effects already being felt " the threat that stocks are going to be put on the market always affects them in a negative way , " said henning gebhardt , at the frankfurt investment fund society dws , in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper .
marcus sander , a telecommunications expert with investment bank sal oppenheim , added in the same article that news of the expected stock sales had already put " a brake on telekom shares . " the government ’ s stake in deutsche telekom , owned through kfw , is worth about € 25 billion at the current market price while its stake in deutsche post is worth around € 11 billion . parking would generate instant cash government sources quoted in the berliner zeitung suggested that the sale of the shares would be done carefully and at the right time , presumably when the market climate was more favorable .
the stocks would more than likely be sold to the kfw bank first rather than directly onto the market , generating cash flow for the government immediately , and then held in trust until the time was right for them to be sold openly . any sales from the airport and harbor privatization action would be placed directly on the market and not parked at the kfw , a government source told the financial news wire dow jones . more privatization to come it was a widely known fact within governmental circles that eichel had already planned to introduce the privatization measures and the generation of funds through the sale of telekom and post stocks in the federal budget before the arrangement was agreed in the mediation committee .
he has since stated that he wants to make further cuts in state participation in the most valuable sectors in 2004 , which could raise an extra € 7 billion and bring the funding to around € 10.3 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german reform deal set for approval germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .

the six members , all net payers into the eu 's coffers , include france , germany , sweden , the netherlands , the united kingdom and austria .
they called for the eu 's budget to be capped at one percent of gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- from 2007 onwards .
currently , spending is capped at 1.24 percent of gni .
in an interview with germany ’ s berliner zeitung newspaper , schreyer slammed the letter , saying " you can not reduce the budget at the time we are enlarging . "
nevertheless , schreyer did not dismiss the letter altogether .
in separate comments to the german daily die welt , schreyer said : " the six states finance 80 percent of the net payers .
therefore , we have to take this letter seriously . "
she also said her office would be willing to negotiate " serious suggestions . "

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.12.2003 germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of germany 's stasi archive could serve as a model for iraqi leaders .
the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some girls have been expelled for wearing headscarves in french schools current laws on the subject are vague and have led to several cases of girls being expelled from schools for wearing headscarves .
schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .
a poll published by le parisien newspaper on wednesday put public opinion behind the ban , showing that 69 percent of french citizens would support that law , compared with 55 percent who said they would back such a move prior to the publication of the expert commission report .
but according to the same poll , only 39 percent of french muslims favor the ban .
germany tackles a similar issue the headscarves debate has become a recurring issue in germany over the past months as well .
earlier this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in the southern city of stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that although germany ’ s constitution did not forbid the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools , individual states could impose such a ban if they wished . since the ruling , the german states of bavaria and baden-württemberg have drafted bills which , if passed , would prohibit teachers in state-funded schools from wearing headscarves .
the bills will be sent before their respective state parliaments for approval early in the new year . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf issue rears its head again “ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some girls have been expelled for wearing headscarves in french schools current laws on the subject are vague and have led to several cases of girls being expelled from schools for wearing headscarves .
schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .
a poll published by le parisien newspaper on wednesday put public opinion behind the ban , showing that 69 percent of french citizens would support that law , compared with 55 percent who said they would back such a move prior to the publication of the expert commission report .
but according to the same poll , only 39 percent of french muslims favor the ban .
germany tackles a similar issue the headscarves debate has become a recurring issue in germany over the past months as well .
earlier this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in the southern city of stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that although germany ’ s constitution did not forbid the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools , individual states could impose such a ban if they wished . since the ruling , the german states of bavaria and baden-württemberg have drafted bills which , if passed , would prohibit teachers in state-funded schools from wearing headscarves .
the bills will be sent before their respective state parliaments for approval early in the new year . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf issue rears its head again “ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers .

the historic deal , which saw 345 votes in favor , 94 against and 88 abstentions , resolves the key hurdle that was preventing member states from giving their go-ahead .
the vote opens up the possibility that the statute could be agreed before the next parliamentary elections in june ; for this , member states would have to accept the proposed compromise by mid-january , ending 25 years of difficult negotiations .
following reservations by member states , meps agreed to increase their pension age from 60 to 63 , and left it up to the eu states whether to impose their national tax regime on top of the lower community tax , as long as double taxation does not occur .
an agreement on the statute would also pave the way for the reform of the meps lavish perk system .

the historic deal , which saw 345 votes in favor , 94 against and 88 abstentions , resolves the key hurdle that was preventing member states from giving their go-ahead .
the vote opens up the possibility that the statute could be agreed before the next parliamentary elections in june ; for this , member states would have to accept the proposed compromise by mid-january , ending 25 years of difficult negotiations .
following reservations by member states , meps agreed to increase their pension age from 60 to 63 , and left it up to the eu states whether to impose their national tax regime on top of the lower community tax , as long as double taxation does not occur .
an agreement on the statute would also pave the way for the reform of the meps lavish perk system .
currently , meps get a big lump sum each time they travel to brussels or strasbourg , irrespective of the actual cost of the ticket .
under the new system , expenses would be based on actual costs .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .

schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .
a poll published by le parisien newspaper on wednesday put public opinion behind the ban , showing that 69 percent of french citizens would support that law , compared with 55 percent who said they would back such a move prior to the publication of the expert commission report .
but according to the same poll , only 39 percent of french muslims favor the ban .

earlier this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in the southern city of stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that although germany ’ s constitution did not forbid the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools , individual states could impose such a ban if they wished . since the ruling , the german states of bavaria and baden-württemberg have drafted bills which , if passed , would prohibit teachers in state-funded schools from wearing headscarves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.12.2003 german ski jumpers face starvation claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter than air : are german ski jumpers anorexic ?
after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .
schmitt has proposed the introduction of a counterweight for lighter athletes and the introduction of shorter skis while the heavier jumpers would have longer ones . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hesitant hero sunday 's victory is only the latest for olympic ski jumping champion sven hannawald , who has transformed himself in one year from an uncertain athlete with a penchant for injury into a legend .

siemens owns one third of framatome .
french technology company areva owns the rest of the company .
the plant will be the first one to be built in the european union since 1991 .
about 2,100 workers will be involved in the year-long construction project , according to a siemens spokesman .
the company had originally planned to get germany ’ s government to serve as a guarantor for a loan for the project .
that request was withdrawn , however , after members of the greens party , the junior partner in germany ’ s government coalition , opposed the project .
the greens also oppose another plan by siemens to sell a dismanteled plutonium plant to china .

siemens owns one third of framatome .
french technology company areva owns the rest of the company .
the plant will be the first one to be built in the european union since 1991 .
about 2,100 workers will be involved in the year-long construction project , according to a siemens spokesman .
the company had originally planned to get germany ’ s government to serve as a guarantor for a loan for the project .
that request was withdrawn , however , after members of the greens party , the junior partner in germany ’ s government coalition , opposed the project .
the greens also oppose another plan by siemens to sell a dismanteled plutonium plant to china .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , a social democrat , supported the sale on a recent trip to china . dw-world.de eu scrutinizes berlin-beijing plutonium plant deal berlin ’ s planned sale of a plutonium plant to beijing , strongly opposed by the greens , could be shelved .
brussels has now stepped in to examine whether the deal could breach existing eu export rules .

the historic deal , which saw 345 votes in favor , 94 against and 88 abstentions , resolves the key hurdle that was preventing member states from giving their go-ahead .
the vote opens up the possibility that the statute could be agreed before the next parliamentary elections in june ; for this , member states would have to accept the proposed compromise by mid-january , ending 25 years of difficult negotiations .
following reservations by member states , meps agreed to increase their pension age from 60 to 63 , and left it up to the eu states whether to impose their national tax regime on top of the lower community tax , as long as double taxation does not occur .
an agreement on the statute would also pave the way for the reform of the meps lavish perk system .
currently , meps get a big lump sum each time they travel to brussels or strasbourg , irrespective of the actual cost of the ticket .
under the new system , expenses would be based on actual costs .

the german government ’ s plans to raise money to finance tax cuts in 2004 could include the sale of state-owned deutsche telekom and deutsche post shares plus the privatization of other interests . german shareholders of deutsche telekom and deutsche post face having the value of their stock slashed if hans eichel , the federal finance minister , has his way in the sweeping tax reforms recently agreed upon in the german parliament . the mediation committee made up of ruling coalition and opposition members of germany 's two legislative chambers , the bundesrat and the bundestag , came to an agreement earlier this week that a total of € 3.3 billion could be generated for the financing of tax relief measures . stock market observers believe the funding wíll come from the sale of a percentage of state-owned telekom and post stocks and the privatization of federal interests in the frankfurt , cologne / bonn and munich airports and the harbor at duisburg .
such sales would contribute towards the financing of the german government ’ s proposed € 7.8 billion package of tax cuts planned for next year . state-owned shares destined for market ? as part of its plan , the government could put telekom stocks worth a total of € 2.3 billion up for sale , in addition to the € 5.5 billion which were “ parked ” with the state-owned development bank kfw in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post shareholders will also suffer .
when these shares eventually make it to market , the effects of such a huge sale on the value of telekom and post shares will be one of widespread dilution .
with so many shares available for sale , the supply and demand ratio would lower the price of all stock , which would spell bad news for company shareholders . effects already being felt " the threat that stocks are going to be put on the market always affects them in a negative way , " said henning gebhardt , at the frankfurt investment fund society dws , in an interview with the berliner zeitung newspaper .
marcus sander , a telecommunications expert with investment bank sal oppenheim , added in the same article that news of the expected stock sales had already put " a brake on telekom shares . " the government ’ s stake in deutsche telekom , owned through kfw , is worth about € 25 billion at the current market price while its stake in deutsche post is worth around € 11 billion . parking would generate instant cash government sources quoted in the berliner zeitung suggested that the sale of the shares would be done carefully and at the right time , presumably when the market climate was more favorable .
the stocks would more than likely be sold to the kfw bank first rather than directly onto the market , generating cash flow for the government immediately , and then held in trust until the time was right for them to be sold openly . any sales from the airport and harbor privatization action would be placed directly on the market and not parked at the kfw , a government source told the financial news wire dow jones . more privatization to come it was a widely known fact within governmental circles that eichel had already planned to introduce the privatization measures and the generation of funds through the sale of telekom and post stocks in the federal budget before the arrangement was agreed in the mediation committee .
he has since stated that he wants to make further cuts in state participation in the most valuable sectors in 2004 , which could raise an extra € 7 billion and bring the funding to around € 10.3 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german reform deal set for approval germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.12.2003 -pipe- 11:00 utc defense ministry under fire for consulting deal with germany ’ s budget reeling from the effects of a stagnant economy , the country ’ s defense ministry has come under fire this week over revelations that it paid a munich-based consulting firm € 11.7 million in fees since 2001 in order to polish its public image .
opposition politicians have criticized the contracts , saying they were not part of a public bidding process .
on thursday , ministry officials conceded that the decision to award millions of euros in work to roland berger , one of germany ’ s top business consultants , had been a personal one made by former defense minister rudolf scharping , a social democrat .
for one three-month period , the ministry paid berger € 1 million euros , a figure the ministry defended , noting it was a " standard " payment for the consulting industry and only a fraction of the german army ’ s annual € 165.6 million budget for consulting and other external services .
however , dietrich austermann , the budget spokesman for the christian democratic union , described the deal as " burning taxpayers ' money . "
a contract for just three months intended to modernize the bundeswehr is not only " meaningless , but also unimaginable , " he said . more briefs 18.12.2003 -pipe- berlin criticizes bush for saddam death penalty insinuation 17.12.2003 -pipe- fischer pushes middle east peace effort 17.12.2003 -pipe- schill to contest party expulsion 17.12.2003 -pipe- kassel tops welfare recipient list 16.12.2003 -pipe- schill party debates expelling founder 16.12.2003 -pipe- iraq 's soccer coach scoops fifa award 16.12.2003 -pipe- nurse acquitted of manslaughter charges 16.12.2003 -pipe- hundertwasser house gets green light radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

opposition politicians have criticized the contracts , saying they were not part of a public bidding process .
on thursday , ministry officials conceded that the decision to award millions of euros in work to roland berger , one of germany ’ s top business consultants , had been a personal one made by former defense minister rudolf scharping , a social democrat .
for one three-month period , the ministry paid berger € 1 million euros , a figure the ministry defended , noting it was a " standard " payment for the consulting industry and only a fraction of the german army ’ s annual € 165.6 million budget for consulting and other external services .
however , dietrich austermann , the budget spokesman for the christian democratic union , described the deal as " burning taxpayers ' money . "
a contract for just three months intended to modernize the bundeswehr is not only " meaningless , but also unimaginable , " he said . more briefs 18.12.2003 -pipe- berlin criticizes bush for saddam death penalty insinuation 17.12.2003 -pipe- fischer pushes middle east peace effort 17.12.2003 -pipe- schill to contest party expulsion 17.12.2003 -pipe- kassel tops welfare recipient list 16.12.2003 -pipe- schill party debates expelling founder 16.12.2003 -pipe- iraq 's soccer coach scoops fifa award 16.12.2003 -pipe- nurse acquitted of manslaughter charges 16.12.2003 -pipe- hundertwasser house gets green light radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.12.2003 german ski jumpers face starvation claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter than air : are german ski jumpers anorexic ?
after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .

martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schmitt .
martin schmitt -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany ’ s four-time ski jumping world champion , accepts that there are health dangers in the sport due to weight pressures and has suggested that new rules should be introduced to stop competitors from starving themselves to gain an advantage .
schmitt has proposed the introduction of a counterweight for lighter athletes and the introduction of shorter skis while the heavier jumpers would have longer ones . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the hesitant hero sunday 's victory is only the latest for olympic ski jumping champion sven hannawald , who has transformed himself in one year from an uncertain athlete with a penchant for injury into a legend .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .
meanwhile , the pentagon announced that it had delayed the bidding conference for reconstruction contracts in iraq until early january .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .
meanwhile , the pentagon announced that it had delayed the bidding conference for reconstruction contracts in iraq until early january .
companies were supposed to begin entering their bids at the end of this week .
there was no reason given for the delay . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush discusses iraq contract row with european leaders u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts .

the german government ’ s plans to raise money to finance tax cuts in 2004 could include the sale of state-owned deutsche telekom and deutsche post shares plus the privatization of other interests . german shareholders of deutsche telekom and deutsche post face having the value of their stock slashed if hans eichel , the federal finance minister , has his way in the sweeping tax reforms recently agreed upon in the german parliament . the mediation committee made up of ruling coalition and opposition members of germany 's two legislative chambers , the bundesrat and the bundestag , came to an agreement earlier this week that a total of € 3.3 billion could be generated for the financing of tax relief measures . stock market observers believe the funding wíll come from the sale of a percentage of state-owned telekom and post stocks and the privatization of federal interests in the frankfurt , cologne / bonn and munich airports and the harbor at duisburg .
such sales would contribute towards the financing of the german government ’ s proposed € 7.8 billion package of tax cuts planned for next year . state-owned shares destined for market ? as part of its plan , the government could put telekom stocks worth a total of € 2.3 billion up for sale , in addition to the € 5.5 billion which were “ parked ” with the state-owned development bank kfw in november . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : post shareholders will also suffer .
when these shares eventually make it to market , the effects of such a huge sale on the value of telekom and post shares will be one of widespread dilution .

" the government ’ s stake in deutsche telekom , owned through kfw , is worth about € 25 billion at the current market price while its stake in deutsche post is worth around € 11 billion . parking would generate instant cash government sources quoted in the berliner zeitung suggested that the sale of the shares would be done carefully and at the right time , presumably when the market climate was more favorable .
the stocks would more than likely be sold to the kfw bank first rather than directly onto the market , generating cash flow for the government immediately , and then held in trust until the time was right for them to be sold openly . any sales from the airport and harbor privatization action would be placed directly on the market and not parked at the kfw , a government source told the financial news wire dow jones . more privatization to come it was a widely known fact within governmental circles that eichel had already planned to introduce the privatization measures and the generation of funds through the sale of telekom and post stocks in the federal budget before the arrangement was agreed in the mediation committee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.12.2003 german ski jumpers face starvation claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighter than air : are german ski jumpers anorexic ?
after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .
" the sport 's doctors are very careful to minimize the risks for athletes through regular medical checks , " he added .

after a german ski jumper claimed he was encouraged to starve to gain an advantage in competition , a former coach has now expressed fears that athletes are being pressured into being anorexic . dedicated training , nerves of steel , scientific appreciation of aerodynamics - there are many factors that combine to allow the world ’ s ski jumpers to fly through the air with the greatest of ease .
but few would consider the extreme practice of starvation as one of the main components of a jumper 's training regime .
yet claims from german jumper frank löffler that he was forced to drastically lose weight is at the center of the latest sporting scandal that is gripping germany .
löffler revealed earlier this week that his career went into freefall when a directive from the german team effectively forced him to starve to remain competitive and set him on a slippery slope of dramatic weight loss .
" i was given an ultimatum to starve myself from 72 kilograms to 68 kilos , " 23-year-old löffler said in an interview with german magazine der s piegel .
" but there was no way i could do this .
this has nothing to do with ski jumping any more but battling the scales .
it has become clear to me that our system is sick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löffler confided to the bild zeitung tabloid that many ski jumpers lived under " permanent terror . "
in an interview with the paper he said he was only allowed 1,200 calories per day .
" that is what a man needs if he does no exercise at all .
but i had to train . ”
however , the german ski federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- has rejected löffler ’ s accusations , saying that he was suspended from the team in the summer for disciplinary reasons and added that his performances were not good enough anyway . but the scandal took another turn on wednesday when reinhard heß , the former coach of the german national ski jumping team , came out with more revelations in an interview with bild .
referring to the experience of fellow german ski jumper sven hannawald , hess admitted that hannawald had been in danger of becoming anorexic a few years ago , saying his health had been “ endangered ” and that his weight loss had pushed him physically and mentally “ to the border . ” less was more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald .
heß explained that hannawald ’ s rising star in the world of ski jumping began to wane when “ he succumbed to the morbid vision : light flies far , even lighter flies further . ”
hannawald -lrb- photo -rrb- returned to training for the 1999/2000 season already seriously under weight and as a consequence suffered from colds and flu throughout the season , eventually losing out in the challenge for the ski jump world championship through illness . after many discussions , heß said hannawald was persuaded to move to a higher weight class and in the following winter had " the season of his life , " becoming the first jumper to win all four events at the " four-hills " tournament , the sport 's showcase competition . however , despite the revelation of his charge ’ s own weight problems , heß was at the same time adamant that no jumper had been forced to starve and that it was the ambition and the demands jumpers put on themselves that could lead to health threatening behavior .
“ it is about fame and a lot of money .
therefore , these sportsmen go to the limits , " he said .
the scandal comes just a few days before this year ’ s four hills tournament starts on december 29 in oberstdorf , germany .
but it is a debate that is far from new in a sport in which weight matters , with many of the top competitors standing over 1.80 meters and weighing just over 60 kilograms .
weight strictly controlled dsv team doctor ernst jakob told the reuters news agency that the ski jumpers were strictly controlled medically to avoid any eating disorders .
" the fact that the athletes are relatively tall and weigh relatively little does not mean there is a health danger in terms of eating disorder , " he said .

french president jacques chirac has voiced support for a law which would ban the wearing of muslim headscarves , christian crosses and other religious symbols in public schools . chirac 's announcement came in response to a report published last week by a government commission , which proposed the ban of religious symbols in the country 's state-run schools .
" in all conscience , i consider that the wearing of dress or symbols which conspicuously show religious affiliation should be banned in schools , " chirac said . the decision comes after months of debate on the role of religion in french society and the difficulties the nation has encountered in the integration of its five million-strong muslim population . the law , which chirac has urged parliament to push through before the start of the 2004 school year next september , will outlaw the wearing of muslim headscarves , jewish skullcaps and large christian crosses , but will make provision for more discrete signs of religious affiliation , such as small pendants . chirac rejected a further commission proposal to add yom kippur , the jewish day of atonement , and the eid al-kebir festival which marks the end of islam 's ramadan month of fasting to the existing list of france 's public school holidays .
he said that pupils in france already had sufficient public holidays . secular state during his speech at the elysee palace , chirac seized the opportunity to stress the continued importance of secularism in french society .
" secularism is one of the republic 's great achievements .
it plays a crucial role in social harmony and national cohesion .
we must not allow it to be weakened , " chirac told an audience of 400 invited guests . secularism in france dates back to 1789 and the french revolution , and has served as a basic principle of the nation 's progressive thought since 1905 when church and state officially separated .
the republic works on the basis of recognizing individuals rather than groups , and the idea of schools and colleges as religion-free zones is in keeping with the basic french notion of citizenship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some girls have been expelled for wearing headscarves in french schools current laws on the subject are vague and have led to several cases of girls being expelled from schools for wearing headscarves .
schools and colleges are currently at liberty to decide for themselves whether they allow their pupils and students to openly display their faith .
the new law will remove this ambiguity , but chirac 's announcement has drawn mixed reactions from french society . prior to the speech , the french council of the muslim faith had warned chirac to be careful not to create a law which discriminates against muslims .
representatives of france 's jewish and catholic populations fundamentally agreed with the suggestions in the commission 's publication last week , and following chirac 's speech , grand rabbi joseph sitruk told the reuters news agency that he was satisfied because he had been worried about a law specifying the size of a kippa or a cross .
a poll published by le parisien newspaper on wednesday put public opinion behind the ban , showing that 69 percent of french citizens would support that law , compared with 55 percent who said they would back such a move prior to the publication of the expert commission report .
but according to the same poll , only 39 percent of french muslims favor the ban .
germany tackles a similar issue the headscarves debate has become a recurring issue in germany over the past months as well .
earlier this year , germany ’ s highest court in karlsruhe ruled that school authorities in the southern city of stuttgart were wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that although germany ’ s constitution did not forbid the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools , individual states could impose such a ban if they wished . since the ruling , the german states of bavaria and baden-württemberg have drafted bills which , if passed , would prohibit teachers in state-funded schools from wearing headscarves .
the bills will be sent before their respective state parliaments for approval early in the new year . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf issue rears its head again “ the decisive thing is not what ’ s on the head , but what ’ s in it , ” says a group of prominent german women who have launched a campaign against the government ’ s headscarf ban for muslim teachers .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .
" they are important to change the culture of secrecy that dominates iraqi society and prevent self-interest groups from presenting a black-and-white picture of history .

the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past . germany ’ s opposition to the u.s.-led war against iraq may be keeping its companies out of the bidding process for lucrative reconstruction projects , but many germans are contributing to rebuilding efforts on the grassroots level .
among them is marianne birthler , who heads the german government agency that serves as custodian of the secret police archives of east germany 's former communist regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler last week , birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- met with exile iraqi groups in washington as part of a private initiative aimed at sharing germany 's own experiences with a totalitarian system and helping iraqis come to grips with a painful past .
at least a million people are believed to have died as victims of torture , poison gas and murder during the reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
parallels between east germany and saddam ?
at the invitation of the heinrich böll foundation in washington , a non-profit organization affiliated with the green party , birthler sought to share her own experiences in piecing together millions of files kept by the east german secret police , or stasi .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes .
and though the mass killings in iraq far outshadow the crimes of the east german communists , both regimes share a common thread in the way they used secret agents , torture and killings to gather intelligence information .
böll foundation director helga flores-trejo said her organization believed germany ’ s 13-year experience in investigating the stasi could provide valuable insights as iraqis begin their own process of truth finding . " there are so many concrete questions on the issue , right from providing help , drawing up laws providing privacy and protection for victims to the issue of credibility and research - the germans have already dealt with it , " she said .
" a messier system in iraq " hassan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation that has collected over six million iraqi government documents , told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans may be more methodic and german law more stringent on questions of privacy , but what the saddam regime lacked in meticulousness and the stasi ’ s resources , it made up for in its multiplicity of secret service agencies , " he said .
" we just had a much messier system in iraq . " mneimneh suggested iraq should create its own authority to manage the study and caretaking of saddam 's secret service archives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files with trials expected for many former iraqi leaders and documents laying in different hands , it could be some time before reconciliation work can begin in earnest .
according to birthler , the largest bulk of the papers are currently in the hands of the provisional iraqi government .
but others have either disappeared or are controlled by diverse religious and political groups .
" there ’ s a big fear that these files could be misused , " birthler told german daily tagesspiegel .
u.s. officials present another sticking point .
according to mneimneh , the iraq survey group , the u.s. intelligence unit hunting for weapons of mass destruction in iraq , controls many of the documents and has been reluctant to share them .
" we 're trying to convince them to release the documents in the interest of the millions of iraqi people who have the right to know what exactly the regime did , " mneimneh said .
" they are important to change the culture of secrecy that dominates iraqi society and prevent self-interest groups from presenting a black-and-white picture of history .

as part of the continued effort to fight international terrorism , the european union has agreed on a deal with the u.s. to share data on airline passengers crossing the atlantic from europe . for europeans , flying to the united states just became a step more complex .
according to a new cooperation agreement signed by washington and brussels , the eu will be required to provide personal information on passengers leaving european destinations for the united states .
the brokering of the deal came after months of debate in which both sides refused to budge .
while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european airlines obliged to follow example of us carriers passing on passenger data became standard practice for american domestic airlines after the sept .
11 attacks , and u.s. intelligence offices have long been piling pressure on non-u.s. carriers to follow suit , fining those who refused to pass on passenger data some € 4,900 -lrb- $ 6,000 -rrb- per head .
negotiators in brussels are aware that washington has driven a hard bargain and got most of what it originally wanted .
an eu commission spokesman told the observer newspaper that they would have preferred the united states to have access to fewer passenger data .
but both sides agreed to review the situation in three and a half years , by which time the need to continue with the procedure may no longer exist .
european criticism the deal has met with criticism from within europe , with tony bunyan of the eu civil liberties body statewatch commenting on the organization 's web site , that the move was the first step towards vetting passengers before they board a plane , boat or cross-border train .
bunyan is evidently concerned that information obtained will not only be used in the fight against terrorism .
" the global surveillance of travel will not be limited to combating terrorism but will extend to other serious crimes - which is now defined so broadly as to include everything but very minor offences , " he wrote .
some members of the european parliament share the skepticism .
mep kathalijne buitenweg told reuters news that although it was necessary to cooperate with the united states , it was also essential to comply with eu law .
" i find it quite excessive to store data for three and a half years and to do this for everyone not just the people the u.s. consider suspect , " buitenweg said .
meanwhile spokesman for the european commission , jonathan todd , said the eu executives would need to consult with the european parliament before the deal could actually be finalized in april or may of next year .
the european commission also said the agreement would set a framework for airlines to pass on data to non-u.s. authorities , adding that the eu was also considering seeking greater access to american passengers ' data . dw staff -lrb- tw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and germany pledge to intensify security cooperation the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features .

while american authorities insisted that they needed the passenger data in their fight against terrorism , the europeans argued that revealing such information would constitute a violation of privacy .
under the agreement , airlines will have to attain information from passengers on 34 different aspects including home address , date of birth , credit card number , size of party traveling , and pieces of luggage .
most of the personal data given by passengers at the time of check-in or ticket-purchase will be sent to the united states ahead of the passengers themselves , giving customs officials the chance to assess the likelihood of the passengers being terrorists of criminals .
mounting pressure originally , u.s. officials demanded the right to hold the data for up to 50 years , but in the new compromise deal , they will only be allowed to keep the information for three and a half years .
the eu also negotiated strict restrictions governing which agencies will have access to the data , and insisted that washington agree to immediately delete particularly sensitive information indicating religion , health and race .

u.s. envoy james baker met with french and german leaders on tuesday .
both are willing to reach a deal to ease iraq 's debt , but the prickly issue of the awarding of contracts to rebuild iraq still leaves open questions . u.s. special envoy james baker met with german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on tuesday to discuss the issue of reducing iraq ’ s foreign debt .
the former u.s. secretary of state is on a european tour to gain support for relieving iraq 's foreign debt and ease a transatlantic row over the awarding of reconstruction contracts in iraq . ahead of the talks , the chancellor said germany was ready to make a " substantial contribution " to rebuilding iraq .
" we will talk about what we should do with iraq ’ s debt , " schröder told reporters before meeting baker . " germany is ready to make a substantial contribution to help rebuilding a democratic and stable iraq .
that will be a subject of our talks today and i think that we will have an agreement within a foreseeable time , " schröder said . german government spokesman bela anda told reporters " germany and the united states are - like france - ready not only to restructure the debt but also to engage in substantial debt forgiveness . " cordial meeting with chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. special envoy james a. baker with french president jacques chirac earlier in the day baker met with french president jacques chirac in paris -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the two men appeared willing to lay aside differences over the iraq war , as they agreed that international creditors must reach a deal to ease iraq ’ s huge foreign debts in 2004 .
" the french and the u.s. government want to reduce the debt burden on iraq so that ist people can enjoy freedom and prosperity , " baker told reporters after meeting chirac .
" it is important to reduce the iraqi debt burden within the paris club -lrb- of creditor states -rrb- in 2004 if possible , " he said .
with claims of almost $ 3 billion -lrb- € 2.4 billion -rrb- not including interest , france is one of the largest creditors to iraq from the paris club , a grouping of nations set up in 1956 to deal collectively with indebted countries .
germany is owed close to $ 5 billion , while iraq ’ s total debts are estimated by the international monetary fund to be around $ 120 billion .
full sovereignty to iraq however there was no mention at tuesday ’ s meeting between baker and chirac of washington reconsidering its decision to exclude war opponents germany , france and russia from bidding for iraqi reconstruction contracts worth $ 18.6 billion .
on monday , france reiterated its demand that a debt relief deal for iraq would be conditional on washington returning full sovereignty to baghdad , and an internationally-approved reconstruction plan .
" this must be done under the auspices of the paris club after a deal with the international monetary fund and when a sovereign government is installed , " french foreign minsiter dominque de villepin said .
" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .
meanwhile , the pentagon announced that it had delayed the bidding conference for reconstruction contracts in iraq until early january .
companies were supposed to begin entering their bids at the end of this week .

" for reconstruction to succeed , it ’ s clear that the entire international community must mobilize hand-in-hand with the united nations to restore a state of law and secure a return to prosperity with an adequate degree of transparency , " he added .
pressure on bush though berlin has indicated in recent months that it is willing to consider some debt reduction towards iraq , it is believed that germany is not too enthusiastic on loosening strict paris club rules on debt relief .
since the capture of former iraqi leader saddam hussein , several countries , including germany , have called on u.s. president bush to revise his policy and allow iraq ’ s reconstruction to happen on a broader , international basis .
" i was extremely pleased to hear of the capture of saddam hussein and i offer my congratulations on this successful operation , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in an official letter to bush .
" i hope his arrest will aid the efforts of the international community in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq . "
bush said he ’ s interested in cooperating with france and germany , and that he didn ’ t think the transatlantic rift over his iraq policy would be a lasting one .
but in an interview with reuters , german defence minister peter struck said the u.s. decision to shut war opponents out of the reconstruction process had further damaged german - u.s. relations .
struck said he hoped baker 's visit to berlin would lead the u.s. to reconsider its policy on iraq 's reconstruction , but that he was not in favor of taking any legal action against the u.s.
" i do n't think there 's any sense in taking the u.s. to court over the question of reconstruction contract , " struck said .
" i hope the talks that james baker will conduct in berlin will bring a change in the stance of the u.s. government , " struck added .
u.s. stays firm on reconstruction bids for the moment , it seems that bush ’ s idea of cooperation with france and germany is limited to working out an agreement on iraq ’ s debt .
there ’ ve been no signals from washington that the government plans to allow the two nations , or any of the other countries that opposed the war , to bid for reconstruction contracts .
nor is there any sign that bush intends to increase the involvement of the international community in peacekeeping activities in iraq .
rather , bush has stressed that the u.s. will be " staying the course " in iraq , and that u.s. troops will remain on the ground until their job was done .

the recommendations , in a report , follow an inquiry into water pricing .
the mps say it is likely prices will be raised in the current periodic review , but that ofwat should closely examine the claims companies make about costs .
improvement cost in early december , uk water regulator ofwat gave companies united utilities and northumbrian water the go-ahead to raise their bills .
the decision will allow the two water companies to increase charges from april 2004 to march 2005 .
the increases come after both companies asked for help to cover rising customer debt problems , as well as the cost of monitoring water standards .
the mps report said : " there has been considerable debate about the scale and cost of the environmental improvements that the environment agency and english nature have put forward .
' review of help ' " water customers must not be expected to pay for every improvement to the aquatic environment , but where water companies are responsible for damage to the environment , they , and their customers should pay to repair that damage . "
they called on the government to " urgently address the issue of how those responsible for diffuse pollution should pay for it , " and for a better system of water management .
" the government should review the way poorer households are helped with their water bills .

the scottish executive has launched a nationwide campaign urging people not to let their drinks out of their sight when they are socialising .
the scheme was unveiled just days after it emerged that one in 12 nightclub drinks were found to have traces of the drug rohypnol .
and in two of edinburgh and glasgow 's night-spots it rose to one in six .
' time for enjoyment ' the effects of rohypnol can include dizziness and loss of memory .
police chiefs , the licensed trade and security staff have joined forces to back the executive campaign .
deputy health minister hugh henry said : " the festive season should be a time for enjoyment .
" but sadly , a sick minority of people see other people 's enjoyment as an opportunity for crime - and there are few more cynical crimes than spiking someone 's drink to make a sexual assault easier .
" dealing with this problem means raising awareness and stopping incidents happening in the first place . "
a fleet of scooters will target streets with popular bars and clubs across the country warning people to remain vigilant .
cases increasing massive 18ft towers featuring an advertisement asking " who 's keeping an eye on your drink ? " will also be placed in glasgow , edinburgh and aberdeen .
other places due to be targeted include stirling , falkirk , dundee , inverness , dumfries , kilmarnock and ayr .
the campaign will last for three weeks over christmas and new year , but mr henry said the executive will continue to drive the message home in the months ahead .
campaigners claim the use of drugs such as rohypnol , ghb and ketamine in date rape cases is on the increase .
all the drugs used are tasteless and odourless so they are difficult to detect in drinks .
according to central scotland rape crisis centre , 34 out of 294 female rape victims claimed they were drugged in 2001 .
that climbed to 41 out of 315 last year - 13 % of all victims .

welsh health and social services minister , jane hutt , is hosting talks at the royal glamorgan hospital .
delegates will evaluate measures put in place to deal with pressures over winter and emphasise the need for effective management at this time .
but opposition politicians have criticised the talks saying they should have been held before winter began .
" you would have expected the summit to take place in august or september to prepare people for the pressures of the winter , " said plaid cymru assembly member and shadow health minister , rhodri glyn thomas . "
it is a simple matter of more beds which could have been created by the minister overnight " rhodri glyn thomas plaid am mr thomas also raised concerns about the problems the nhs is likely to face if there is a large rise in emergency cases .
" if it continues as it is people will suffer some people might die .
" we know that hospitals are telling us they do n't have the capacity to deal with pressures . "
" it is a simple matter of more beds which could have been created by the minister overnight . "
delegates from health bodies from across wales will be at the summit .
one of the topics up for debate will be how the 22 new local health boards will adapt to the challenge of commissioning emergency services .
the issue of delays in transferring patients - so-called ' bed blocking ' - is another major problem ms hutt 's summit will need to grapple with .
welsh conservative health spokesman , jonathan morgan , said it was not the numbers of beds that was the issue but how the beds were used .
mr morgan said jane hutt was reluctant to charge local authorities for delaying the transfer from acute to care homes sector .

staff from the island 's public services department took the action after they received complaints from the public about seaweed in grouville bay .
residents in gorey complained about flies and a bad smell after large quantities of vraic seaweed were washed up on the beaches .
workmen have now taken lorry loads of seaweed down to the low water mark to alleviate the problem .
the seaweed was washed ashore during a recent spring tide , but stayed on the beach and started to decompose .

green fields , bare trees and cloud - that is the picture likely to greet everyone in wales on 25 december , rather than a traditional white christmas .
weather forecasters are predicting that mild air from the atlantic will sweep across wales just before christmas day , ruining any hope of snow .
with the prospects of a white christmas receding , some bookmakers have even taken bets on this christmas day becoming the hottest on record .
to qualify for a white christmas , snow must fall on designated points across the uk between 0001 gmt and 2359 gmt on 25 december . "
the only thing that is likely to fall out of the sky will be rain " derek brockway but according to bbc wales meteorologist derek brockway , the best chance of festive snow in wales will come in a pre-christmas cold snap on sunday , before the weather changes again .
derek said : " there is no chance of a white christmas in wales .
" temperatures will be too high , with south-westerly winds off the atlantic .
" the only thing that is likely to fall out of the sky will be rain .
' green fields ' " before 25 december , we are in for a cold snap and there could be some sleet and snow in places , particularly over the hills and mountains in north and west wales .
" but the weather on christmas day will originate from the azores , although that does n't mean we are in for a heatwave .
" the winds will cool as they move north towards wales and pick up moisture in the form of cloud - but it will be too warm for snow .
" on christmas morning , all we 'll see is green fields , bare trees and cloudy skies . "
" we have now had a series of bets on there being a heatwave , based on the fact that we had such a hot summer " karl williams , jack brown bookmaker as the chances of a white christmas grow slimmer , some have bet on this year 's temperatures surpassing the 15.6 degrees registered in edinburgh in 1896 and devon 1920 , making those the warmest christmases on record .
welsh bookmaker jack brown has cut its odds on a christmas day heatwave from 100-1 to 66-1 after a series of bets on record-breaking temperatures this year .
the pontypridd-based firm has also been forced to lengthen its odds on snow to 6-1 as the prospects of a white christmas lessen .
jack brown spokesman , karl williams , said : " we had a lot of money on a white christmas last week , but people are now starting to hear that it 's probably not going to snow .
" we have now had a series of bets on there being a heatwave , based on the fact that we had such a hot summer . "
mr williams added that jack brown was forced to pay out for a white christmas last year , despite the fact that the first snow did not fall until close to midnight on christmas day .
" last year , we paid out after a brief snowfall at eight minutes to midnight at cardiff international airport , " he said .
" there have been a surprising number of ' white christmases ' since the last one that people would recognise as a true white christmas , with thick snowfall , which happened in 1982 . "

gedling borough council , in nottinghamshire is offering free ashtrays on the streets of arnold .
rubbish left by smokers accounts for almost half arnold 's street litter .
but critics of the scheme say the taxpayers ' money would be better spent helping people quit smoking rather than just cleaning up after them .
cleaning costs originally designed in australia to prevent bush fires , the ashtrays are made form heat resistant plastic and have a sealable lid .
it is estimated people in the gedling area smoke 100,000 cigarettes a day .
the ashtrays cost the council around £ 1 each , but are being given away .
the council denies the idea is a waste of money .
a gedling council spokesman said : " they demonstrate a commitment from the council to a long term initiative to reduce the amount of street litter .
" yes , they have cost us a little money , but in the long term if we reduce the amount of litter on the street it hopefully will reduce the amount we have to spend clearing the street . "

the plan was given the go-ahead by transport secretary alistair darling on tuesday when he unveiled the government 's long-awaited plans for the development of aviation over the next 30 years .

" we are showing baa that we are going to be the biggest thorn in their side , " she said .
" they have n't seen anything yet . "
following the announcement , campaigners told bbc news online they are planning a whole clutch of legal challenges to the proposals .
the government white paper said stansted 's new runway should be ready by 2011 or 2012 .
experts predict that the new runway could see stansted 's passenger numbers climb from about 12 million in 2000 to 74 million in 2030 .

the us economy affects the whole world the us economy is the largest in the world , with a gross domestic product of over $ 10 trillion - one quarter of the world 's total .
but it has suffered from uneven growth in the past few years .
after an unprecedented period of expansion during the 1990s , the economy ground to halt just as the 2000 election was taking place .
the mild recession of 2001 was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in september , which temporarily dented business and consumer confidence .
signs of growth : state of the us economy at-a-glance that in turn boosted unemployment , which reached 6 % of the workforce by early 2003 .
the democrats had hoped to make the economy , and the jobless recovery , the central issue of the 2004 presidential campaign .
but by the end of 2003 , the economy appeared to be back on track , with an annualised growth rate of 8.2 % and falling unemployment .
jobless recovery the jobless recovery has been caused not only by the economic slowdown , but also by the rapid growth of productivity , which means that firms can produce more goods without having to hire more workers .
the remarkable growth of productivity , which seems to be growing by at least 2.5 % annually - double the rate in europe - will lead to higher real wages for us workers in the long run .
that high productivity has also helped keep inflation low and that in turn will encourage the us central bank , the federal reserve , to leave interest rates on hold at a 40-year low of 1 % .
low interest rates have also boosted the housing market , and encouraged people to re-mortgage their homes , releasing capital into the economy .
but consumers have borrowed heavily to boost consumption , and the debt overhang is another factor that has left the fed reluctant to increase interest rates .
feel-good factor however , the good economic news has yet to filter down to the voters .
president bush 's approval ratings for his handling of the economy have been consistently lower than his overall poll ratings - but they are improving .
recent polls by the new york times / cbs news suggest that while only 37 % approved of mr bush 's economic record in late september , nearly half -lrb- 49 % -rrb- did so by mid-december 2003 .
and over half -lrb- 55 % -rrb- now think that the economy is in " good " or " fairly good " shape .
meanwhile , nearly 40 % think it is getting better - double the number earlier in the year .
the economy continues to be the top issue that voters are interested in , with 25 % saying they think the presidential candidates should talk about jobs and the economy , compared to 14 % who consider medicare and health issues important , and only 7 % the war or iraq .
however , from a personal point of view economic confidence remains fragile .
this may partly be due to the fact that wages and salaries are growing more slowly in the recovery than corporate profits .
it may also be the lagging effects of unemployment , with the democrats still able to claim that mr bush will be the first president since herbert hoover to leave office with fewer people in work than when he came into power .
unemployment is not as high as when the first president bush was defeated by the upstart bill clinton in 1992 , nor as high as when president ronald reagan won a second term in 1984 .
but particularly in the " rust belt " states like michigan , ohio , illinois and pennsylvania , with their highly unionised workforces in manufacturing , unemployment is a key issue .
many of these workers tend to blame cheap imports from the far east for their plight .
protectionist pressures with the us trade deficit approaching a record $ 500bn , there have been increasing calls for more protectionist measures - particularly against china , which alone accounts for more than a quarter of the trade gap .
many of the democratic hopefuls for president have endorsed such demands , and want new protection for workers and the environment included in any new trade deals .
mr bush has been steering a difficult course , agreeing to trade sanctions against steel and textiles imports while maintaining his position in favour of free trade .
however , neither of the major world trade negotiations he has endorsed - the doha round of trade talks and the free trade area of the americas , the centrepiece of his foreign policy in his first year in office - are likely to come to fruition before the election .
instead , it could be the opening up of the world clothing and textile market to full competition on 31 december 2004 , which has already been agreed in the last round of trade talks , that proves the focus of the election campaign .
but trade is not an issue that galvanizes us public opinion , and views are very mixed .
in a survey of public opinion over nafta , the free trade agreement between the us , canada , and mexico that is 10 years old in december 2003 , american enterprise institute fellow karlyn bowman found that almost half of those interviewed had no opinion of its impact .
a further quarter were not sure whether it had created or lost jobs for us workers .
americans seem to both believe that free trade is good for the us economy , and fear that it causes the loss of good jobs .
but in recent polls only 12 % wanted to pull out of nafta , while just 15 % said their jobs were threatened by foreign imports .
dollar under pressure it may well be that international foreign exchange dealers , rather than steelworkers in pennsylvania , will ultimately play a bigger role in determining the direction of the us economy .
the bush administration has adopted a posture of benign neglect to the accelerating decline of the us dollar on international currency markets , which has fallen by 30 % against the euro in 2003 .
the fall of the dollar has helped make manufacturing exports in those rust belt states cheaper and imports more expensive , contributing as much as mr bush 's now-abandoned tariffs to protecting the steel industry .
in the long run the fall in the dollar should lead to more exports and fewer imports into the us , adjusting the trade balance .
but that could take several years , and meanwhile a runaway fall in the dollar could have unforeseen consequences for world financial markets .
the growing federal budget deficit , as well as the growing trade gap , are increasingly seen as unsustainable by foreign investors , who are therefore increasingly reluctant to invest in the us and finance the gap .
whoever becomes the next president will have to address these problems early in his term of office .

huntley murdered 10-year-olds holly wells and jessica chapman ian huntley has been given a mandatory life sentence but the tariff - the minimum term he actually serves - has yet to be decided .
until a year ago it would have been down to home secretary david blunkett to decide the length the murderer stayed in prison .
but the system of tariff-setting is in the process of being changed .
from thursday offences such as huntley 's will carry whole life terms .
because huntley 's offence was committed in august 2002 , his case is subject to transitional arrangements .
this means the minimum term that he will serve in prison will be decided by an appeal court judge - to be appointed by the judiciary - not the trial judge .
' whole life ' tariffs the home office says this tariff-setting process will take months .
the judge must take into account the new principles set out under the criminal justice act , which became law on thursday .
the new principles state that " whole life " prison terms are given for : multiple murders - two or more - that show a " high degree of premeditation , involve abduction of the victim or are sexual or sadistic " .
murder of a child following abduction or that involves sexual or sadistic conduct .
the principles also state that there will be a starting point of 30 years for other multiple murders .
mr blunkett said that under the old system , the last time he had a similar case - roy whiting , who abducted and murdered sarah payne - he imposed a 50 year tariff .
' theoretically possible ' although he can no longer decide whether life means life mr blunkett told journalists he hoped huntley 's sentence would reflect the fact that under the old system - and the one which begins shortly - a 50 year or " whole life " tariff would be expected .
later , criminal justice sources suggested it was " theoretically possible " that huntley could get a " whole life " tariff .
tariffs like this had been set by successive home secretaries in exceptional cases in the past , such as for moors murderer ian brady .
" it follows that having regard to that and to the details of this case , it is theoretically possible that an appeal court judge might think that appropriate , " the source said .

but the system of tariff-setting is in the process of being changed .
from thursday offences such as huntley 's will carry whole life terms .
because huntley 's offence was committed in august 2002 , his case is subject to transitional arrangements .
this means the minimum term that he will serve in prison will be decided by an appeal court judge - to be appointed by the judiciary - not the trial judge .
' whole life ' tariffs the home office says this tariff-setting process will take months .
the judge must take into account the new principles set out under the criminal justice act , which became law on thursday .
the new principles state that " whole life " prison terms are given for : multiple murders - two or more - that show a " high degree of premeditation , involve abduction of the victim or are sexual or sadistic " .
murder of a child following abduction or that involves sexual or sadistic conduct .
the principles also state that there will be a starting point of 30 years for other multiple murders .
mr blunkett said that under the old system , the last time he had a similar case - roy whiting , who abducted and murdered sarah payne - he imposed a 50 year tariff .
' theoretically possible ' although he can no longer decide whether life means life mr blunkett told journalists he hoped huntley 's sentence would reflect the fact that under the old system - and the one which begins shortly - a 50 year or " whole life " tariff would be expected .
later , criminal justice sources suggested it was " theoretically possible " that huntley could get a " whole life " tariff .
tariffs like this had been set by successive home secretaries in exceptional cases in the past , such as for moors murderer ian brady .

later , criminal justice sources suggested it was " theoretically possible " that huntley could get a " whole life " tariff .
tariffs like this had been set by successive home secretaries in exceptional cases in the past , such as for moors murderer ian brady .
" it follows that having regard to that and to the details of this case , it is theoretically possible that an appeal court judge might think that appropriate , " the source said .

a report by the commons public accounts committee has said there is evidence of " a blind eye " being turned to fraud .
it also points to the possible collusion between some department staff and farmers .
it was the foot-and-mouth cull which helped unearth what the public accounts committee described as " a quite staggering degree of fraud " .
more than half the sheep farmers in one area had been attempting to cheat the system , it said .
the pac said the department had failed in its duty as custodian of the public purse and needed to get a much firmer grip on the sheep annual premium scheme which paid out £ 170m from 1995 to last year .
the farming industry is a very proud industry but we are no different to any other walk of life and quite clearly we have rotten apples in our barrel john gilliland ulster farmers union the committee said it found a " catalogue of errors and control failures " which , it said , pointed towards a " particularly slack regime " .
the report highlights shortcomings in flock records , marking of sheep and the system of inspections .
the committee claims that departmental staff were at times complicit in turning a blind eye to the rules .
the committee said it was not convinced that collusion between farmers and departmental staff had not been an issue .
but responding to the report , agriculture minister ian pearson said he was content there was " no deliberate disregard " for the control requirements .
the department is now preparing a detailed response to the criticisms in the report .
mr pearson said he was pleased the report acknowledged the efforts made to crack down on the potential for fraud .
edward leigh , chairman of the committee of public accounts , said : " it is clear that this scheme has not received the close management and supervision that it deserves .
' undermined ' " the most damning aspect of the department 's handling is the extent to which key requirements of the scheme were repeatedly ignored , over a long period of time .
" non-compliance was not confined to unscrupulous claimants - there is evidence that departmental staff were at times complicit in turning a blind eye to the rules .
as a result , the integrity of the scheme has been undermined . "
however , ulster farmers union president john gilliland said that despite the problems facing the industry , changes would give greater transparency for tax payers and bring about a better quality of life for farmers .
" the farming industry is a very proud industry but we are no different to any other walk of life and quite clearly we have rotten apples in our barrel , " he said .
" but it is important that for the name of 98 % of farmers out there who are not law breakers that the other 2 % do have a heavy hand on them .

a report by the commons public accounts committee has said there is evidence of " a blind eye " being turned to fraud .
it also points to the possible collusion between some department staff and farmers .
it was the foot-and-mouth cull which helped unearth what the public accounts committee described as " a quite staggering degree of fraud " .
more than half the sheep farmers in one area had been attempting to cheat the system , it said .
the pac said the department had failed in its duty as custodian of the public purse and needed to get a much firmer grip on the sheep annual premium scheme which paid out £ 170m from 1995 to last year .
the farming industry is a very proud industry but we are no different to any other walk of life and quite clearly we have rotten apples in our barrel john gilliland ulster farmers union the committee said it found a " catalogue of errors and control failures " which , it said , pointed towards a " particularly slack regime " .
the report highlights shortcomings in flock records , marking of sheep and the system of inspections .
the committee claims that departmental staff were at times complicit in turning a blind eye to the rules .
the committee said it was not convinced that collusion between farmers and departmental staff had not been an issue .
but responding to the report , agriculture minister ian pearson said he was content there was " no deliberate disregard " for the control requirements .
the department is now preparing a detailed response to the criticisms in the report .
mr pearson said he was pleased the report acknowledged the efforts made to crack down on the potential for fraud .
edward leigh , chairman of the committee of public accounts , said : " it is clear that this scheme has not received the close management and supervision that it deserves .
