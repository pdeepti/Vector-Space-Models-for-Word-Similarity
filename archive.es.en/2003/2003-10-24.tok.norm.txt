abdelghani mzoudi is facing conspiracy charges in hamburg for allegedly aiding several of the suicide hijackers who carried out the attacks .
german intelligence officials tried to give the court a transcript of an interrogation of ramzi binalshibh , who is being held in the united states on suspicion of masterminding the attacks .
but the chancellery and the federal interior ministry both intervened to stop the handover .
mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that binalshibh 's evidence is vital to establishing whether their client was linked to the hamburg cell of the al qaeda terrorism network . more briefs 24.10.2003 -pipe- espionage case deepens 21.10.2003 -pipe- historian 's new book courts controversy 16.10.2003 -pipe- triple murder in law office 15.10.2003 -pipe- newton ’ s nudes find a home in berlin 15.10.2003 -pipe- court tries owner of dog who gives hitler salute 10.10.2003 -pipe- german states divided over headscarf ban 10.10.2003 -pipe- pole sitters call it a day 10.10.2003 -pipe- brain drain worries german business leaders radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the international tug-of-war for the hamburg-based cosmetics maker beiersdorf ended on thursday with the announcement that a german consortium would acquire financial giant allianz 's stake in the company . the winning bid led by coffee roaster and retailer tchibo and the city-state of hamburg ensures that beiersdorf , the manufacturer of the massively successful nivea line of cosmetics and skin creams , will stay in the city , preserving 4,800 jobs .
it also puts american multinational procter & gamble , which has had its sights on beiersdorf for months now , out of the bidding .
going into the deal , tchibo holding ag already held 30.1 percent of beiersdorf .
but once the ' t 's are crossed and the ' i 's dotted , the company , owned by hamburg 's herz family , a local business dynasty , will control 49.9 percent of beiersdorf .
the city of hamburg 's investment arm , the hamburger gesellschaft für beteiligungsverwaltung , is also purchasing 10 percent of the company .
in recent years , the city experienced a troubling exodus of jobs after major corporations including cigarette-maker reemtsma , travel and shipping company hapag-lloyd , haircare products-maker hans schwarzkopf and the vereins and westbank ag were aquired by companies outside of hamburg .
in order to avoid a repeat scenario , the city opted to join forces with the herz family .
the remaining shares will be sold to beiersdorf as part of a stock buyback program , with allianz retaining 3.6 percent of the stock .
in total , the deal is expected to total € 4.4 billion .
high stakes for weeks , beiersdorf has been the subject of a high stakes poker game between tchibo , the city-state of hamburg , and cast of international players led by procter and gamble , l 'oréal , henkel and unilever .
executives at tchibo told reporters in recent weeks that they feared procter & gamble would have merged beiersdorf with the darmstadt-based welle , another beauty products manufacturer , and move its headquarters out of hamburg .
but by thursday , tchibo put an end to the speculation .
" we found a solution that offers avantages for everyone involved , " tchibo ceo dieter ammer said , adding that with its clearer shareholder structure , it would now be easier for the company to establish a leading market position .
the deal also brings to an end a difficult period of uncertainty for beiersdorf - it 's now been two years since cash-strapped allianz announced its intentions to sell its shares in the cosmetics-maker .
hamburg 's christian democratic mayor , ole von beust , greeted the deal , saying he was pleased that beiersdorf would remain in the city as a publicly traded , stand-alone company .
" our further goal is to make beiersdorf the most valuable company in hamburg to be traded on the german stock exchange , " von beust said .
tricky for hamburg however , the deal has been tricky for hamburg , which failed to line up a a state-owned bank to back the deal .
the city is heavily in debt , but von beust sought to assuage tax-payers on thursday , saying the deal would have no impact on the city 's budget during 2003-2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust " whether or not it has an impact in the following years depends on economic developments and can not be determined at this point , " the mayor said .
financially , the move could prove lucrative for the city .
however , the deal is still contingent on approval by germany 's federal cartel office .
for more than a decade , beiersdorf has counted itself among the elite league of top german exporters .
between 1992 and 2002 , the sales in the company 's nivea division were explosive , growing from € 695 million to € 2.63 billion .

it also puts american multinational procter & gamble , which has had its sights on beiersdorf for months now , out of the bidding .
going into the deal , tchibo holding ag already held 30.1 percent of beiersdorf .
but once the ' t 's are crossed and the ' i 's dotted , the company , owned by hamburg 's herz family , a local business dynasty , will control 49.9 percent of beiersdorf .
the city of hamburg 's investment arm , the hamburger gesellschaft für beteiligungsverwaltung , is also purchasing 10 percent of the company .
in recent years , the city experienced a troubling exodus of jobs after major corporations including cigarette-maker reemtsma , travel and shipping company hapag-lloyd , haircare products-maker hans schwarzkopf and the vereins and westbank ag were aquired by companies outside of hamburg .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .
bundestag convinced an overwhelming majority of 531 out of 593 mp 's voted in favor of the motion .
only 57 mp 's voted against , while 5 abstained .
despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .
struck made it clear to parliament that while isaf has had many successes in afghanistan , the mission is not without an element of danger .
before the vote he spoke of " signs of stagnation " in the country that can not be overlooked .
the focus now , he said , should be on boosting the reach and power of afghanistan 's new governing body led by president hamid karzai , and preventing the country from once again becoming a home base for terrorist organisations .
drug war off limits but struck drew the line at involving german soldiers in afghanistan 's struggle with the illegal drug trade .
" we do n't protect any drug lords , we 're there to protect our civil workers helping in the reconstruction effort , " struck said in an interview with ard television , adding that drugs were a matter for the local police .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the plan would grant the people of afghanistan " a more dignified way of life , " and backed struck 's view that the bundeswehr 's expanded presence would make it easier for charitable organisations to carry out their work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.10.2003 german group secures stake in beiersdorf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beiersdorf makes the popular nivea-line of beauty products .
the international tug-of-war for the hamburg-based cosmetics maker beiersdorf ended on thursday with the announcement that a german consortium would acquire financial giant allianz 's stake in the company . the winning bid led by coffee roaster and retailer tchibo and the city-state of hamburg ensures that beiersdorf , the manufacturer of the massively successful nivea line of cosmetics and skin creams , will stay in the city , preserving 4,800 jobs .
it also puts american multinational procter & gamble , which has had its sights on beiersdorf for months now , out of the bidding .
going into the deal , tchibo holding ag already held 30.1 percent of beiersdorf .
but once the ' t 's are crossed and the ' i 's dotted , the company , owned by hamburg 's herz family , a local business dynasty , will control 49.9 percent of beiersdorf .
the city of hamburg 's investment arm , the hamburger gesellschaft für beteiligungsverwaltung , is also purchasing 10 percent of the company .
in recent years , the city experienced a troubling exodus of jobs after major corporations including cigarette-maker reemtsma , travel and shipping company hapag-lloyd , haircare products-maker hans schwarzkopf and the vereins and westbank ag were aquired by companies outside of hamburg .
in order to avoid a repeat scenario , the city opted to join forces with the herz family .
the remaining shares will be sold to beiersdorf as part of a stock buyback program , with allianz retaining 3.6 percent of the stock .
in total , the deal is expected to total € 4.4 billion .
high stakes for weeks , beiersdorf has been the subject of a high stakes poker game between tchibo , the city-state of hamburg , and cast of international players led by procter and gamble , l 'oréal , henkel and unilever .
executives at tchibo told reporters in recent weeks that they feared procter & gamble would have merged beiersdorf with the darmstadt-based welle , another beauty products manufacturer , and move its headquarters out of hamburg .
but by thursday , tchibo put an end to the speculation .
" we found a solution that offers avantages for everyone involved , " tchibo ceo dieter ammer said , adding that with its clearer shareholder structure , it would now be easier for the company to establish a leading market position .
the deal also brings to an end a difficult period of uncertainty for beiersdorf - it 's now been two years since cash-strapped allianz announced its intentions to sell its shares in the cosmetics-maker .
hamburg 's christian democratic mayor , ole von beust , greeted the deal , saying he was pleased that beiersdorf would remain in the city as a publicly traded , stand-alone company .
" our further goal is to make beiersdorf the most valuable company in hamburg to be traded on the german stock exchange , " von beust said .
tricky for hamburg however , the deal has been tricky for hamburg , which failed to line up a a state-owned bank to back the deal .
the city is heavily in debt , but von beust sought to assuage tax-payers on thursday , saying the deal would have no impact on the city 's budget during 2003-2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust " whether or not it has an impact in the following years depends on economic developments and can not be determined at this point , " the mayor said .
financially , the move could prove lucrative for the city .
however , the deal is still contingent on approval by germany 's federal cartel office .
for more than a decade , beiersdorf has counted itself among the elite league of top german exporters .
between 1992 and 2002 , the sales in the company 's nivea division were explosive , growing from € 695 million to € 2.63 billion .
other strong beiersdorf brands augment nivea 's success , bringing the company 's total sales last year to € 4.7 billion , after tax profits to € 290 million and market valuation to over € 9 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german maker of nivea line reports record profits last year , more people than ever used nivea creams to keep the wrinkles away .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .
bundestag convinced an overwhelming majority of 531 out of 593 mp 's voted in favor of the motion .
only 57 mp 's voted against , while 5 abstained .
despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .
struck made it clear to parliament that while isaf has had many successes in afghanistan , the mission is not without an element of danger .
before the vote he spoke of " signs of stagnation " in the country that can not be overlooked .
the focus now , he said , should be on boosting the reach and power of afghanistan 's new governing body led by president hamid karzai , and preventing the country from once again becoming a home base for terrorist organisations .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "

german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .
bundestag convinced an overwhelming majority of 531 out of 593 mp 's voted in favor of the motion .
only 57 mp 's voted against , while 5 abstained .
despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .
struck made it clear to parliament that while isaf has had many successes in afghanistan , the mission is not without an element of danger .
before the vote he spoke of " signs of stagnation " in the country that can not be overlooked .
the focus now , he said , should be on boosting the reach and power of afghanistan 's new governing body led by president hamid karzai , and preventing the country from once again becoming a home base for terrorist organisations .
drug war off limits but struck drew the line at involving german soldiers in afghanistan 's struggle with the illegal drug trade .
" we do n't protect any drug lords , we 're there to protect our civil workers helping in the reconstruction effort , " struck said in an interview with ard television , adding that drugs were a matter for the local police .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the plan would grant the people of afghanistan " a more dignified way of life , " and backed struck 's view that the bundeswehr 's expanded presence would make it easier for charitable organisations to carry out their work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.10.2003 italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of europe 's pensioners continues to grow .
italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .
whether the ensuing political debate spills out onto the streets – like in italy , france and elsewhere – remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .
whether the ensuing political debate spills out onto the streets – like in italy , france and elsewhere – remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .
bundestag convinced an overwhelming majority of 531 out of 593 mp 's voted in favor of the motion .
only 57 mp 's voted against , while 5 abstained .
despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .
struck made it clear to parliament that while isaf has had many successes in afghanistan , the mission is not without an element of danger .
before the vote he spoke of " signs of stagnation " in the country that can not be overlooked .
the focus now , he said , should be on boosting the reach and power of afghanistan 's new governing body led by president hamid karzai , and preventing the country from once again becoming a home base for terrorist organisations .
drug war off limits but struck drew the line at involving german soldiers in afghanistan 's struggle with the illegal drug trade .
" we do n't protect any drug lords , we 're there to protect our civil workers helping in the reconstruction effort , " struck said in an interview with ard television , adding that drugs were a matter for the local police .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the plan would grant the people of afghanistan " a more dignified way of life , " and backed struck 's view that the bundeswehr 's expanded presence would make it easier for charitable organisations to carry out their work .
if the bundeswehr 's mission proves successful , it could spearhead similar missions in other towns such as herat , kandahar and masar-i-sharif . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder approves new afghan troop deployment the german cabinet met in berlin on wednesday to approve the planned deployment of german peacekeeping soldiers to the northern afghan region of kunduz .

but the reconstruction teams and the isaf expansion are helping the country along its difficult road .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .

earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.10.2003 german parliament approves expanded afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a contingent of bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan will soon be leaving for the northern city of kunduz .
as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .
bundestag convinced an overwhelming majority of 531 out of 593 mp 's voted in favor of the motion .
only 57 mp 's voted against , while 5 abstained .
despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .

earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .

despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .
struck made it clear to parliament that while isaf has had many successes in afghanistan , the mission is not without an element of danger .
before the vote he spoke of " signs of stagnation " in the country that can not be overlooked .

with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .

earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .
bundestag convinced an overwhelming majority of 531 out of 593 mp 's voted in favor of the motion .
only 57 mp 's voted against , while 5 abstained .
despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .
struck made it clear to parliament that while isaf has had many successes in afghanistan , the mission is not without an element of danger .
before the vote he spoke of " signs of stagnation " in the country that can not be overlooked .
the focus now , he said , should be on boosting the reach and power of afghanistan 's new governing body led by president hamid karzai , and preventing the country from once again becoming a home base for terrorist organisations .
drug war off limits but struck drew the line at involving german soldiers in afghanistan 's struggle with the illegal drug trade .
" we do n't protect any drug lords , we 're there to protect our civil workers helping in the reconstruction effort , " struck said in an interview with ard television , adding that drugs were a matter for the local police .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the plan would grant the people of afghanistan " a more dignified way of life , " and backed struck 's view that the bundeswehr 's expanded presence would make it easier for charitable organisations to carry out their work .

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .
bundestag convinced an overwhelming majority of 531 out of 593 mp 's voted in favor of the motion .
only 57 mp 's voted against , while 5 abstained .
despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .
struck made it clear to parliament that while isaf has had many successes in afghanistan , the mission is not without an element of danger .
before the vote he spoke of " signs of stagnation " in the country that can not be overlooked .
the focus now , he said , should be on boosting the reach and power of afghanistan 's new governing body led by president hamid karzai , and preventing the country from once again becoming a home base for terrorist organisations .
drug war off limits but struck drew the line at involving german soldiers in afghanistan 's struggle with the illegal drug trade .
" we do n't protect any drug lords , we 're there to protect our civil workers helping in the reconstruction effort , " struck said in an interview with ard television , adding that drugs were a matter for the local police .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the plan would grant the people of afghanistan " a more dignified way of life , " and backed struck 's view that the bundeswehr 's expanded presence would make it easier for charitable organisations to carry out their work .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "
bsirske , however , avoided indicating whether his union or others would call for large-scale protests . but the unions are n't the governing coalition 's only problem .
they also face tough opposition from the conservatives , who control the upper house of the parliament , the bundesrat .

italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system . it ’ s long been no secret that europe ’ s ageing population presents a demographic time bomb .
with more retirees and fewer tax-paying workers to support them , the continent ’ s governments are being forced to pursue highly unpopular measures to shore up their creaky social security schemes . on friday , the first draft of emergency legislation aimed at plugging the holes in germany 's ailing pension system was debated in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
german chancellor schröder ’ s coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens put the finishing touches on the draft thursday night and a majority of coalition members , including all members of the green party , voted to support it . however , 15 spd members withheld their support , sighting problems with certain social aspects of the draft .
despite the spd dissenters , the party 's parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering said he was confident the legislation would pass with the support of all of its members when it comes down to the final vote on november 6th . “ you can believe me that i don ’ t enjoy doing this , ” social minister ulla schmidt told parliament while defending the government ’ s decision to cap pensions for 2004 at current levels . while the debate raged over pension reform in germany , a general strike paralyzed much of italy on friday .
the country 's three powerful unions called for the strike to protest similar efforts to reform the pension system there .
earlier this year , strikes hit france and austria , also protesting pension reform . in germany , facing tough opposition from the unions and the opposition conservative christian democrats , the government may be in for an equally bumpy ride as they attempt to set right a system that will run a deficit of more than € 8 million in 2004 . debate in the bundestag the draft legislation debated in the bundestag on friday proposes several tough measures meant to help overcome the deficit .
among them : pension contributions -lrb- the percentage of working people 's income given over to funding the pension system -rrb- will remain stable at 19.5 percent , pensioners will not receive a cost of living increase in 2004 , payments will be distributed at the end of the month instead of at the beginning of the month -lrb- effectively cutting one month 's payment -rrb- , and pensioners will have to pay nursing insurance benefit premiums . and one other hotly debated issue , whether or not to raise the official retirement age from 65 to 67 , was not resolved .
a final decision on the matter was pushed back to 2010 . germany , like many other countries in europe , is facing a growing crisis over the pension system .
the percentage of each working person 's income devoted to keeping the system afloat continues to rise and non-wage related costs have ballooned , further dragging on an already troubled german economy .
what 's more , a demographic problem - pensioners are living longer and drawing on the system longer , while a falling birth rate means there are fewer working-generation people paying into the system - has further overloaded the system .
countries elsewhere in europe are grappling with similar pension-related issues . strikes cripple italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi in italy , prime minister silvio berlusconi has announced tough measures to tackle the pension crisis .
earlier this year , he went on nationwide television to drum up support for his reform program , which , among other things , proposes raising the official retirement age by several years from 57 to 65 for men and to 60 for women . in response , italy 's three major unions called for a general strike on friday , which shut down most airline and train service , public transportation as well as schools .
even fans of one of italy 's most beloved pastimes , opera , were inconvenienced when rome 's famous la scala opera house was closed due to the strike . berlusconi 's first government was toppled in 1994 , when his attempts to take on the issue were met with popular unrest .
though experts say this is unlikely to happen this time around as berlusconi firmly has the support of his coalition partner , lega nord , which left him out in the cold in 1994 .
but the pension system is still largely considered the sacred cow of politics throughout europe , with politicians proposing changes at their own risk . german unions ready to rumble ? germany 's governing coalition could face similar problems here in germany if the unions decide to take the issue to the streets .
thus far , union leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction with the proposals , but stopped short of calling for strikes or protests . " we are going to take this debate to the factory shop floor , where we have the greatest strength , " said frank bsirske , head of the massive service sector trade union verdi , told the financial times deutschland .
" that is where we will concentrate our energies over the next few weeks . "

as the german bundestag on friday voted to expand the scope of germany 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan , defense minister peter struck said german troops would n't get mixed up in the country 's war on drugs . until now , the mission of the german army , or bundeswehr , in afghanistan has been contained to the area in and around the capital , kabul .
but to combat increasing lawlessness in remote parts of the country , the leaders of nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan say it 's necessary to set up a center of command in the northern afghan city of kunduz .
due to constitutional requirements , the german parliament has to approve any military deployments or , as in this case , significant changes to deployments .
the petition before parliament on friday included an extension of the german isaf contingent 's mandate to october 13 , 2004 , as well as increasing the number of soldiers from 1800 to as many as 2250 .
a team of 230 - 450 soldiers is set to be deployed in kunduz .
bundestag convinced an overwhelming majority of 531 out of 593 mp 's voted in favor of the motion .
only 57 mp 's voted against , while 5 abstained .
despite criticism about the government 's handling of the expansion plan , the opposition conservatives and liberals supported the new mission .
struck made it clear to parliament that while isaf has had many successes in afghanistan , the mission is not without an element of danger .
before the vote he spoke of " signs of stagnation " in the country that can not be overlooked .
the focus now , he said , should be on boosting the reach and power of afghanistan 's new governing body led by president hamid karzai , and preventing the country from once again becoming a home base for terrorist organisations .
drug war off limits but struck drew the line at involving german soldiers in afghanistan 's struggle with the illegal drug trade .
" we do n't protect any drug lords , we 're there to protect our civil workers helping in the reconstruction effort , " struck said in an interview with ard television , adding that drugs were a matter for the local police .
german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said the plan would grant the people of afghanistan " a more dignified way of life , " and backed struck 's view that the bundeswehr 's expanded presence would make it easier for charitable organisations to carry out their work .

the 47th annual london film festival is under way and the city now boasts a greater number of cinemas per head of population than new york .
so why is it that a london assembly report has found that the vast majority of people in the city are facing an ever decreasing choice of films ?
an investigation into local cinemas by the assembly 's culture committee found that " leisure and cultural needs of londoners are not being met " as hollywood blockbusters dominate the screens .
in a snapshot survey of 68 films on show outside the west end during a week in august , the committee found that more than 75 % of the screenings were for just six movies : terminator 3 , pirates of the caribbean , what a girl wants , rugrats go wild , spy kids 3 and legally blonde 2 .
" we should not be blinded by the billboard lights of leicester square , " says the report .
the area where alfred hitchcock was born , leytonstone , no longer has an operational cinema meg hillier , chairwoman of the culture committee how does your borough fare ?
" outside the west end , londoners ' access to a local cinema and to a diverse range of films is dramatically reduced . "
multiplexes make up 35 of the 60 picture houses in outer london .
some boroughs like lewisham in south-east london and waltham forest in the north-west , do not even have a working cinema .
the report adds : " the greater proportion of multiplexes outside the west end and their decisions on programming contributes to geographical differences in the diversity of film on offer . "
' paltry range ' three odeon franchises within the west end put on specialist films compared to only one in the whole of outer london , where 60 % of residents live .
warner village , which has 10 multiplexes in london , screens asian films at their flagship village in leicester square .
but it does not show them in acton in west london or harrow in the north-west , despite their large asian communities , the committee found .
meg hillier , chair of the committee , said : " the area where alfred hitchcock was born , leytonstone , no longer has an operational cinema .
i think independent cinemas should be part of local cultural and regeneration programmes ruth mulandi , general manager phoenix cinema " the city in which 300 languages are spoken shows a paltry range of foreign language films outside of the west end .
" we recognise that cinemas are businesses and many do not want to take risks on films that might not put bums on seats .
" but cinemas do have a role to play in celebrating the diversity in our multicultural society . "
responding to the report vue entertainment , which owns warner village , said : " vue has publicly stated its commitment to offering audiences a wider variety of films .
" the great advantage of running multiplexes is that we have the facilities to allow this without sacrificing traditional blockbuster entertainment .
" we are sympathetic to many of the findings of the culture committee 's report and we are actively working to ensure that all our customers have access to the films they want to watch in the best surroundings possible . "
the phoenix is one of the country 's oldest cinemas the report says independent cinemas outside central london are not always the answer because they are often limited to one screen and are under the same pressures as multiplexes to show sure-fire hits .
ruth mulandi , general manager of the successful independent phoenix cinema in east finchley , north london , told bbc news online : " when the multiplex opened up in west finchley we started to show some main stream films but now we cater for a whole different audience , showing art house , independent and foreign films .
" i think independent cinemas should be part of local cultural and regeneration programmes .
" also there should be a one-off , capital investment donation or grant so that they can invest in other revenue streams - such as a coffee bar - so that they can become self-sufficient .
" at the moment things are done on a shoe-string . "
the report wants the mayor to use his planning powers to address the lack of cinemas in outer london .
it also urges the office of fair trading to examine how the relationship between distributors and cinema exhibitors can be balanced to encourage choice .

he said that the scientific assessment on which a ban would be based shows scotland 's major fish , haddock , at a 30 year high , while the under threat cod stock rose over the last four years .
a report from the international council for the exploration of the sea -lrb- ices -rrb- , advises european union ministers to endorse zero catches of cod in the north sea , off western scotland and in the irish sea until they return to an acceptable level .
mr salmond said : " to actually suggest putting thousands of people who depend on the haddock , prawn , and whiting fishery out of work is ludicrous and irresponsible .
environmental causes " little wonder that the scottish fishing communities have had their fill of a common fisheries policy which uses science as a political instrument .
" it is the policy which should be disposed of , not the fishing families of scotland . "
he said that the haddock , prawn and whiting fishery should be ' decoupled ' from cod .
" it is absurd and dangerous to run a fishery as if only one stock mattered when 80 % of scotland 's fishing industry is not cod . "
all of these draconian cuts are simply going to end up with the collapse of the scottish fishing industry and not going to bring back a single cod to our waters " struan stevenson " it is immoral to ignore the real environmental causes of the cod scarcity , which are north sea warming and industrial fishing . "
mr salmond 's sentiments were echoed by tory mep struan stevenson , chairman of the european parliament 's fisheries committee .
mr stevenson told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that new evidence shows the cod have simply moved further north due to a shift in cold water plankton due to climate change .
" the fishermen are saying this is a king canute strategy , you can not by political decisions taken by bureaucrats in brussels expect the cod suddenly to swim back into warm waters around the coast of britain where there is no plankton for their larvae to feed on .
" they 've seen off the coast of newfoundland in canada , where exactly the same phenomenon has happened , that the cod have n't returned even after a moratorium on fishing of 10 years .

" the fishermen are saying this is a king canute strategy , you can not by political decisions taken by bureaucrats in brussels expect the cod suddenly to swim back into warm waters around the coast of britain where there is no plankton for their larvae to feed on .
" they 've seen off the coast of newfoundland in canada , where exactly the same phenomenon has happened , that the cod have n't returned even after a moratorium on fishing of 10 years .
" all of these draconian cuts are simply going to end up with the collapse of the scottish fishing industry and not going to bring back a single cod to our waters . "

he said that the scientific assessment on which a ban would be based shows scotland 's major fish , haddock , at a 30 year high , while the under threat cod stock rose over the last four years .
a report from the international council for the exploration of the sea -lrb- ices -rrb- , advises european union ministers to endorse zero catches of cod in the north sea , off western scotland and in the irish sea until they return to an acceptable level .
mr salmond said : " to actually suggest putting thousands of people who depend on the haddock , prawn , and whiting fishery out of work is ludicrous and irresponsible .
environmental causes " little wonder that the scottish fishing communities have had their fill of a common fisheries policy which uses science as a political instrument .
" it is the policy which should be disposed of , not the fishing families of scotland . "
he said that the haddock , prawn and whiting fishery should be ' decoupled ' from cod .
" it is absurd and dangerous to run a fishery as if only one stock mattered when 80 % of scotland 's fishing industry is not cod .
all of these draconian cuts are simply going to end up with the collapse of the scottish fishing industry and not going to bring back a single cod to our waters struan stevenson " it is immoral to ignore the real environmental causes of the cod scarcity , which are north sea warming and industrial fishing . "
mr salmond 's sentiments were echoed by tory mep struan stevenson , chairman of the european parliament 's fisheries committee .
mr stevenson told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that new evidence shows the cod have simply moved further north due to a shift in cold water plankton due to climate change .

marjorie davies , 68 , from llanelli , said she believed they should be taken out of shops and only allowed in organised firework displays .
" all i hope is that they do take them off the market because they 're lethal and they should n't be sold to children underage anyway , " she said on friday .
her view is supported by politicians in westminster .
a bill currently going through parliament seeking to impose tougher curbs on the sale and use of fireworks .
the fireworks bill , which has cross-party support , aims to reverse the trend towards year-round firework displays and general misuse which cause misery to residents , pets , and wild animals .
mrs davies ' chair was ripped apart the private members ' bill , sponsored by labour mp bill tynan , will also make the noisiest fireworks illegal and impose stricter rules on the training of those who give professional displays .
on friday , police appealed for information after a firework was thrown into an unoccupied car parked in the ely area of cardiff .
meanwhile relatives of the attack on mrs davies have been calling for anyone with information about the culprits to contact the police .
mrs davies ' hair caught fire when the 2ft rocket hit the chair she was sitting in at her home in bryn golau as she watched television .
her husband ken davies , who was in an upstairs room , rushed to help and had to throw water over her and the burning chair .
the grandmother of six also suffered cuts to her face and hands , perforated ear drums .
doctors at swansea 's morriston hospital had to remove pieces of glass from her head .
her family believe the house was deliberately targeted because she had challenged local teenagers about their behaviour in the past .
police forensic experts have carried out tests at the house and have told mrs davies she can now return .
but mrs davies has said she is terrified to go back , for fear of further attacks .
explosion her two sons and daughter have appealed to the parents of those responsible to turn them over to the police .
the explosion was so powerful it also shattered a second window , knocked pictures off the walls , and destroyed the letterbox on the front door , 20ft away .
mrs davies ' husband was the first to see what had happened .
" i heard one big explosion and i ran downstairs , " he said .
" i heard my wife screaming and i found her in the chair bleeding , with the back of her hair all burned . "
her son chris phillips said : " her hair was on fire and he threw water to stop it .
" i was here with 10 minutes and was trying to talk to her but she could not hear anything i was saying .
" she was in shock as she was taken to hospital .
" the doctors said she had a comfortable night and i 'm going to collect her this morning as she is being transferred to singleton .
" quite often she looks after some of the grandchildren for a couple of hours and it 's just very lucky none of them were with her . "
local teenagers her daughter haley rees said : " i just do not know what is wrong with people .
" she has lived here for more than 20 years but i will make sure she never has to come back here .
" i can not tell you what i would do to those responsible .
" someone must know as word soon gets out - if their parents know then they should tell the police as this was deliberate .
there is no question of that . "
her son stephen phillips believes local youths are responsible mrs davies 's other son stephen phillips said he was convinced the incident was linked to trouble with local teenagers in the past .
" the kids are targeting the house because she phoned the police - because she stands up for herself .
" this could have been a manslaughter case .
" if she had been here by herself , she could n't have got out of the chair quick enough .
she could have burned in that chair , and they would have had to live with that on their conscience .
" the people who sold the fireworks would have had that on their consciences , too .
it 's bloody disgusting . "
police are investigating and forensic experts examined the house on thursday .
inspector ian richards said : " this was a mindless act and we will do our best to identify and deal with the people responsible . "
anyone with information is asked to contact llanelli police on 01554 772222 .
the comments published here represent the balance of views received : i do n't know what it 's like in the rest of the country , but here in south wales we are tormented by kids throwing fireworks from august to december .
this is a horrifying case which shows that fireworks should be banned except for public displays and there should be harsher penalties for anti-social behaviour and selling fireworks to children .
mrs davies stood up against the intimidation that so many of us face and i 'm glad she was not more criticaly injured .
i wish her a speedy recovery .
jess , cardiff , uk fireworks are safe as long as those who hold then respect what they have , and others around them .
however when the immature get hold of them and cormit a crime , they know the law in this country is weak .
neil , wales fireworks should be for public displays only and should be handled by professionals .
every year there are reports of injuries to people and animals , and most pets are distressed by the noise .
they should never be handled by children .
they are explosives after all , and you would n't let a child play with a loaded gun would you ?
c wakeford , uk fireworks should be banned completly , and if neccessary only the army allowed to use them at orgonised november 5th events .
ben , scotland i grew up in llanelli and we did n't have the money to buy fireworks as kids .

i have lived in the states for 12 years and streets are far safer here than in my home town .
it 's such a shame that a lack of decipline has produced a society of yobs .

vince , uk by all means restrict their sale to adults and try and encourage there safe use but trying to ban them wo n't work .
there are chinese , indians and other groups who use them to celebrate at other times than november 5th .
also if you ca n't buy them officially people will buy them from illegal sources and these fireworks are likely to cause far mor injuries and damage .
peter , uk i think all fireworks should be withdrawn from sale and those found misusing them should be heavily fined.there is an idiot on my estate who has been letting off fireworks all year , sometimes in the early hours .
dave , england fireworks should only be sold to professional licenced users to hold public displays .
for the past three months they hve been going off at all hours of the day and night .
it is distressing for pets and annoying for the rest of us .
some shopkeepers are not responsible enough to sell them to the right people .
these things are lethal and should be regulated .
helen , uk ban them .
the police have better things to do than to monitor firework use .
karen , uk i suppose we should also ban the sale of chisels , so that they can not be used in basic instinct-style attacks .
graeme phillips , germany , normally uk i would go further , and demand fireworks are only available to organisations for displays , and are not for sale to the general public .
anyone caught selling or letting them off should be fined a minimum of £ 1,000 john ritchie , england a law should be brought in that no fireworks are sold until at least two days before fireworks night and then only to organised events or adults over the age 18 years -lrb- with proof of identity . -rrb-
fireworks have been going off for the last two weeks in the area , and not just small crackers !
michelle hopkins , wales the sale of fireworks to the general public should be banned , and only available for licensed displays .
many of them now sound like miniature -lrb- or not so miniature -rrb- bombs .
you would n't allow people to buy hand grenades or similar weapons , yet these fireworks can be just as devastating in their effects .
most of them are n't even pretty , just make a noise .
my dog has spent almost every evening since september trembling in the corner because he is frightened by the noise .
it is getting increasingly difficult to find a time to walk him without fireworks going off and frightening him .
an irish man who spoke at our church last weekend said it was like being in belfast at the height of the troubles .
christine rotheram , uk i believe that fireworks sould only be used at displays this would reduce the risk to innocent people .
i was hit by a firework on new years ' morning .
luckily , i was not hurt as i had on a thick coat , and jumper and it hit my shoulder .
i was in a state of shock for ages .
would hate to think what marjorie is going through .
ban fireworks from all shops .
angela , uk i would be sad to see the sale of fireworks to the public banned completely , but it 's high time for some tighter controls .
perhaps the point of sale should be restricted to fewer , reputable outlets which are prepared to enforce age restrictions and would be easier for the authorities to licence and monitor .
certainly increase the age limit for buying fireworks to 21 years .
some enforcable restrictions on the dates and the time of day people can discharge fireworks could be introduced .
if the current unsatisfactory state of affairs is allowed to persist and deteriorate then it will become harder to argue against the proposals for an outright ban .
dale deacon , england children have no idea about assessing risks , as an experienced chemistry teacher i would not let any of my pupils near gunpowder in school , but they can go out after school and buy it from the shops .
fireworks should not be sold to the general public .
andrew gray , uk i think that fireworks should not be on sale to the general public .
why would anyone want to buy them in the first place ?
the whole guy fawkes business is a farce anyway , why ' celebrate ' an attempted terrorist attack on parliament ?
if however people do wish to see a firework display then why not go to an organised event .
at present this madness seems to span several weeks , whereas when i was a child the letting off of explosives was limited to either the weekend before , the actual day , or the weekend after november 5th , not to mention during reasonable hours .
in the part of london i live in , you can expect fireworks to be let off at all times of the day and night .
in my opinion it 's a complete nonsense , but if people must do it then please let there be some regulation .
pw , uk the sale of fireworks should be restricted to the week before november 5th - and even then should only be sold to responsible adults .
being over 18 does n't automatically make you responsible !

mark , uk no , they should n't be sold at all .
there are many organised events , most of them free to attend .
even if you have to pay a fee to enter the grounds , it is still normally no more expensive than buying fireworks yourself .
there is no need for them to be sold over the counter to anybody - it 's just asking for trouble .
m williams , n wales sales of explosives and firearms are rigidly controlled , why not fireworks ?
it is long past the time when the sale of these dangerous weapons should be licensed .
roger , uk firework sales should be banned except on the 4th & 5th november .
anyone selling as above or setting off fireworks other than on 5 november should face an automatic custodial sentence .
alan finch , england in chatham they sell fireworks all year round , and it is really annoying when someone thinks it is funny to let a load off , at one in the morning .
andrew akerman , england in canada , where i 'm from originally , fireworks can only be used by licensed pyrotechnic experts .
it was unlicensed when i was a child and my brother has the burn scar on his leg to prove it -lrb- fireworks and wellie boots do n't mix ! -rrb- .
i absolutely believe they should be banned to the general public - these are dangerous items and people take them far too lightly .
janet hill , uk i do n't think they should be banned , but they could be restricted for sale .
there should also be a restriction on when they can be used i.e. seven days before or after guy fawkes , but illegal at all other times .
banning them because of a few irresponsible people is really not fair on every one else .
tony , uk a similar thing happened to my neighbour two years ago -lrb- although there was no indication that it was a deliberate attack -rrb- .
a rocket smashed through her window and landed in her bathroom .
she was away on holiday at the time , and it was only because another neighbour went to investigate that the fire did n't spread through the flat and along the terrace .
throughout october , the area where i live begins to feel like a war zone , with fireworks let off at all hours of the day and night .
i believe that the sale of all fireworks larger than sparklers should be restricted to licensed operators at public displays .
heidi , uk i do n't think fireworks should be on sale to the public , only organised displays should have them .
youths have been setting fireworks off in my area since august .
i say ban them all together from shops .
graham powell , wales i think fireworks should be on sale all year round .
people should have the choice of being able to buy fireworks for other reasons than just bonfire night .
i do feel , however , that the minimum age for a person to buy fireworks should be raised to 21 and the shop keepers who sell fireworks to people under-age should face harsher punishment .
perhaps some community service in a burns unit might give them something to think about .
nicci , reading , uk i think all fireworks should not be sold at all to the general public .
why is it we can buy fireworks but we ca n't buy guns .
fireworks are a killer in the wrong hands and do have gun powder inside them after all .

her view is supported by politicians in westminster .
a bill currently going through parliament seeking to impose tougher curbs on the sale and use of fireworks .

" she has lived here for more than 20 years but i will make sure she never has to come back here .
" i can not tell you what i would do to those responsible .

there is no question of that . "
her son stephen phillips believes local youths are responsible mrs davies 's other son stephen phillips said he was convinced the incident was linked to trouble with local teenagers in the past .
" the kids are targeting the house because she phoned the police - because she stands up for herself .
" this could have been a manslaughter case .
" if she had been here by herself , she could n't have got out of the chair quick enough .
she could have burned in that chair , and they would have had to live with that on their conscience .

" all i hope is that they do take them off the market because they 're lethal and they should n't be sold to children underage anyway , " she said on friday .
her view is supported by politicians in westminster .
a bill currently going through parliament seeking to impose tougher curbs on the sale and use of fireworks .
the fireworks bill , which has cross-party support , aims to reverse the trend towards year-round firework displays and general misuse which cause misery to residents , pets , and wild animals .
mrs davies ' chair was ripped apart the private members ' bill , sponsored by labour mp bill tynan , will also make the noisiest fireworks illegal and impose stricter rules on the training of those who give professional displays .

meanwhile relatives of the attack on mrs davies have been calling for anyone with information about the culprits to contact the police .
mrs davies ' hair caught fire when the 2ft rocket hit the chair she was sitting in at her home in bryn golau as she watched television .

the grandmother of six also suffered cuts to her face and hands , perforated ear drums .
doctors at swansea 's morriston hospital had to remove pieces of glass from her head .

local teenagers her daughter haley rees said : " i just do not know what is wrong with people .
" she has lived here for more than 20 years but i will make sure she never has to come back here .
" i can not tell you what i would do to those responsible .
" someone must know as word soon gets out - if their parents know then they should tell the police as this was deliberate .
there is no question of that . "
her son stephen phillips believes local youths are responsible mrs davies 's other son stephen phillips said he was convinced the incident was linked to trouble with local teenagers in the past .
" the kids are targeting the house because she phoned the police - because she stands up for herself .
" this could have been a manslaughter case .
" if she had been here by herself , she could n't have got out of the chair quick enough .
she could have burned in that chair , and they would have had to live with that on their conscience .
" the people who sold the fireworks would have had that on their consciences , too .
it 's bloody disgusting . "
police are investigating and forensic experts examined the house on thursday .

the firm has contacted more than a dozen investment banks to help arrange a share sale , and has already drawn up a shortlist , the wall street journal reported .
according to reuters , a flotation of the privately-owned firm is pencilled in for early next year , a deal that could value google at up to $ 25bn -lrb- £ 14.7bn -rrb- - slightly more than listed online retailer amazon .
the financial times , meanwhile , reported that google planned to sell shares by means of an online auction - an unusual method which would aim to avoid the sort of brokerage scandals seen in some share flotations in the 1990s .
canny timing google 's intention to sell shares has never been in doubt : such a move would raise capital , and enable the firm to motivate staff with perks such as stock options .

an initial public offering on the sort of scale google is reportedly contemplating would be by far the biggest share launch since hi-tech markets turned sour three years ago .
the sheer size of the deal makes it likely that google will choose an investment bank-led transaction , rather than selling shares directly to the public online .
friday 's reports cited unnamed sources within google ; the company itself has refused to comment .

network rail chairman ian mcallister said the move would ensure " greater consistency of maintenance standards and help deliver efficiency savings more quickly than would otherwise have been possible " .
" we have studied the implications in great detail and concluded that it is the right thing to do , " he said .
there has been growing criticism that contracting out maintenance work had been inefficient and was jeopardising safety .

the firm is under investigation over its maintenance of the track at potters bar , where an accident claimed the lives of seven people last year .
on thursday , more than £ 60m was wiped off jarvis ' stock market value after claims that the engineering firm falsified documents relating to rail upgrade work .
the 16 % fall in the company 's share price followed news that network rail is investigating the company over allegations that records of substandard rail upgrades were falsified .

the statistics commission 's investigation concluded census officials may have missed huge chunks of the population in westminster .
an interim report called for the office for national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- , which ran the £ 200m survey , to carry out a recount in 2006 in the " very hard to count " areas such as city centres and inner london , with transient populations .
the census infuriated urban councils such as westminster , which saw its population fall by 25 % , or 63,000 people .
deputy leader of westminster council , kit malthouse , told bbc london the borough could lose £ 63m in grants as a result .
while the census put westminster 's population at 181,000 , an independent mori survey estimated 215,000 , while council tax and electoral registers suggested 236,000 , he added .
lost homes other evidence suggested the ons may have missed up to 25,000 homes , he said .
in addition , kensington and chelsea in west london , lost more than 30,000 people , manchester more than 45,000 , middlesbrough 10,000 and brighton 12,000 .
rural areas were affected as well - such as forest heath district council in suffolk , which the census said had 55,000 residents compared with 71,000 a decade earlier .
statistics commission chairman professor david rhind said : " evidence we have examined on the use of ... methodology in 2001 indicates that when the initial enumeration misses as much of the resident population as it did in westminster , even sophisticated estimation techniques may not entirely compensate for the initial absence of reliable data . "
new proposals ons chief len cook said : " we want to make the best of what we will have then and we are publishing proposals today that present a way forward .
" alongside this long-term strategy , i will be releasing shortly , plans for concluding the census matching studies we are doing with manchester city and westminster city , and the way we will provide population estimates of the reliability needed by people at local , regional and national level in the immediate decade to come .

the glasgow kelvin member immediately denounced the decision as " politically motivated " and said labour would rue the day it decided to throw him out .
but labour chairman ian mccartney insisted that party had been right to expel a man who " incited foreign forces to rise up against british troops " .
mixed emotions george galloway 's constituents react to his expulsion in pictures " he was the only labour mp to do this and he has never taken back or apologised for these comments , " he said .
mr galloway predicted he would " certainly " contest the next election as an independent and said he might quit to run against labour in a by-election .
he faced five charges relating to a number of television interviews , including one during the war in which he accused mr blair and george bush of acting " like wolves " in invading iraq .
the charges faced by mr galloway were understood to be that : he incited arabs to fight british troops he incited british troops to defy orders he incited plymouth voters to reject labour mps he threatened to stand against labour he backed an anti-war candidate in preston he was found guilty of all but the third charge .
the accusations were judged to break a rule which bans " bringing the labour party into disrepute by behaviour that is prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party " .
there is no right of appeal against the ruling , although it is possible that it could be challenged in the courts .
mr galloway said : " this was a politically motivated kangaroo court whose verdict had been written in advance in the best tradition of political show trials . "
i intend to make sure that tony blair regrets this day george galloway ' disgust ' from constituency chairman he went on to warn that labour might well act against other mps opposed to the iraq war such as glenda jackson and bob marshall-andrews .
and he added that the anti-war movement " is not going away " .
" labour will rue the day that they took this decision , " said mr galloway .
he said that he had been a member of the party for 36 years having joined when he was just 13-years-old .
" i was prominent in the labour party when tony blair was just an ugly rumour , " he said in a jibe about the prime minister 's student band .
health jibe and , in a reference to the prime minister 's weekend health scare , mr galloway continued : " i am still under 50-years-old , i have a strong heart . "
he said he would stick around to " fight with every bone in my body to bring a lying , deceiving prime minister to account " .
have your say george was simply reinforcing the view of the british public on the iraq war andy , leeds , uk send us your comments he added that he was determined to stay in public life .
" i intend to make sure that tony blair regrets this day , " he said .
the mp got a rousing reception on thursday evening as he arrived at an anti-war meeting in haringey , london .
three members of labour 's 11-man national constitutional committee had heard evidence both from mr galloway and from deputy general secretary chris lennie .
labour says the disciplinary committee are rank-and-file party members who are " fiercely independent " .
' demeaning ' the committee was made up of labour " rank-and-file " members noel jenkins , rose burley and lee vasey .
on wednesday , mr galloway said : " while i have no complaint about the conduct of the tribunal itself , the evidence of the labour party 's only witness , it 's own deputy general secretary , was a sad , degrading and demeaning affair . "
rose burley , chair of the national constitutional committee panel , said in a statement : " following the case brought by the national executive committee of the labour party to the national constitutional committee and after a two day hearing the unanimous decision of the panel of the national constitutional committee found four of the five charges brought against mr galloway proven and the decision of the panel was that mr galloway be expelled from membership of the labour party forthwith .

the crawley-based company said profits for the year to 30 october would be " in line with expectations , " thanks in part to a late surge in summer bookings after the end of the iraqi conflict in mid-march .
first choice said it had also minimised the impact of the war by reducing capacity in april and may , when jittery consumers were reluctant to make firm bookings .
it added that tour operators had been forced to become more flexible to cope with sudden peaks and troughs in demand in the wake of the 11 september attacks .

" demand , particularly for peak periods , remains high , but increased uncertainties in the world mean fewer customers are prepared to commit early in the booking period . "
it said the 2003 summer season had been one of its best ever , and described demand for winter bookings so far as " strong . "
first choice has weathered the travel industry turmoil better than some of its competitors by increasing its focus on high-margin niche holidays based around activities such as sailing , trekking and golfing .
in the six months to april , the firm narrowed its losses to £ 44.1m before goodwill , down from £ 49.5m one year earlier .
the company will report full year results on 9 december .

they died within a year of each other ; her daughter just two days after giving birth , her granddaughter when she was seven months pregnant .
my granddaughter unia was bewitched .
she died when she was just 15 theresa nakanwagi united nations agencies this week said that an unacceptable number of women in developing countries are dying in childbirth and that access to specialist care during labour must be improved as a matter of urgency .
sitting in theresa nakanwagi 's home as she recalls how her relatives died , it is clear that a great deal of educating is still needed .
theresa 's daughter , mariam , was 38 and expecting her eighth child .
" i have given birth seven times without any problems so why should i go to the hospital this time , " mariam had told her midwife .
mariam gave birth without complications but due to the negligence of the midwife , her baby then bled through the umbilical cord and died the next day .
" when she saw her dead baby , mariam 's own condition worsened .
she also lost a lot of blood .
we tried to get her treated but the following day she died at the gates of the hospital , " recalls theresa .
educating men the official figure in uganda is that for every 100,000 pregnancies , 505 mothers die .
that is close to one in 200 , compared to one in 2,500 in the united states .
but midwives say the true figure is likely to be far higher because the data is not always collected .
mariam died after the birth of her eighth child the uganda private midwives association aims to reduce the maternal mortality rate with its " life saving skills " initiative .
this involves offering training to more than 600 midwives spread throughout the country .
the association has produced a list of the major obstacles to progress and number one on the list is poor male involvement .
mary goretti of the life saving skills initiative says the husbands or boyfriends must be educated about the dangers of pregnancy .
" you find a husband will not allow his wife to deliver in a hospital .
he says he was born in a banana plantation , so sees nothing wrong with his wife doing the same . "
jealous wife have your say never is one more at risk than at birth , and as long as women die in childbirth , that nation will lack stability vit , usa send us your comments but mary goretti says it is not just the men who need to change , it is the whole community .
" my granddaughter unia was bewitched .
she died when she was just 15 , " laments theresa .
when she was seven months pregnant by a married man , unia began going into convulsions or fits .
" we tried to counter this with herbal remedies , " theresa says .
unia 's unborn baby died in her womb and when she was finally taken to hospital it was too late for the doctors to save her .
mothers often turn up at the clinic with a flask and pretend it is full of tea when in fact it contains traditional medicine mary goretti ugandan midwife unia 's fits were symptoms of pre-eclampsia - a condition which is caused by high blood pressure during pregnancy .
but to this day , theresa 's family believe the jealous wife of unia 's baby 's father used herbs to bewitch her .
educating girls local midwife sarah nakitto , who works with the life saving skills project , says lessons can be learnt from these two deaths .
" they do n't know what can cause maternal mortality and what preventative measures can be taken .
sarah and mary have a big battle on their hands " we have to educate people about family planning because unia was so young .
and her mother was delivering almost every year so if she had known more about family planning she would not have died , " she says .
theresa says girls ' education is the key to reducing maternal mortality in uganda .
" every girl should go to school - if a girl has education she can decide her own future , " says theresa , remembering that unia did n't even make it to the end of primary school when she became pregnant .
a high number of the maternal deaths are due to girls getting pregnant at a young age , mary goretti says .
" such girls often fear telling their parents that they are pregnant and so consult their fellow adolescents .
then they induce abortion by inserting objects in the vagina or they drink local remedies which often prove fatal , " she says .
uphill task the danger caused by unregulated traditional medicines is another challenge for the midwives .
chance of death in childbirth and pregnancy sierra leone , afghanistan : one in six angola , malawi , niger : one in seven nepal : one in 24 pakistan : one in 31 india : one in 48 uganda : one in 200 malaysia : one in 660 china : one in 830 us : one in 2,500 south korea : one in 2,800 britain : one in 3,300 japan : one in 6,000 sweden : one in 29,800 " mothers often turn up at the clinic with a flask and pretend it is full of tea when in fact it contains traditional medicine , " says mary goretti .
there are many factors contributing to high maternal mortality .
while better equipped health centres and more midwives in the rural areas would certainly help , general poverty is a major barrier .
it is not unheard of for health workers to demand payment before seeing a mother .
the midwives have an uphill task .
malaria and hiv / aids are both working against them and in the last five years the number of deaths has merely changed from 506 per 100,000 to 505 .
but the deaths of theresa 's daughter , mariam , and granddaughter , unia , could both have been prevented with better knowledge .
so the life saving skills team sees education as key and will continue to work with the entire community , including the men and those who use witchdoctors .

they died within a year of each other ; her daughter just two days after giving birth , her granddaughter when she was seven months pregnant . "
my granddaughter unia was bewitched .
she died when she was just 15 " theresa nakanwagi united nations agencies this week said that an unacceptable number of women in developing countries are dying in childbirth and that access to specialist care during labour must be improved as a matter of urgency .
sitting in theresa nakanwagi 's home as she recalls how her relatives died , it is clear that a great deal of educating is still needed .
theresa 's daughter , mariam , was 38 and expecting her eighth child .
" i have given birth seven times without any problems so why should i go to the hospital this time , " mariam had told her midwife .
mariam gave birth without complications but due to the negligence of the midwife , her baby then bled through the umbilical cord and died the next day .
" when she saw her dead baby , mariam 's own condition worsened .
she also lost a lot of blood .
we tried to get her treated but the following day she died at the gates of the hospital , " recalls theresa .
educating men the official figure in uganda is that for every 100,000 pregnancies , 505 mothers die .
that is close to one in 200 , compared to one in 2,500 in the united states .
but midwives say the true figure is likely to be far higher because the data is not always collected .
the uganda private midwives association aims to reduce the maternal mortality rate with its " life saving skills " initiative .
this involves offering training to more than 600 midwives spread throughout the country .
the association has produced a list of the major obstacles to progress and number one on the list is poor male involvement .
mary goretti of the life saving skills initiative says the husbands or boyfriends must be educated about the dangers of pregnancy .
" you find a husband will not allow his wife to deliver in a hospital .
he says he was born in a banana plantation , so sees nothing wrong with his wife doing the same . "
jealous wife have your say " never is one more at risk than at birth , and as long as women die in childbirth , that nation will lack stability " vit , usa but mary goretti says it is not just the men who need to change , it is the whole community .
" my granddaughter unia was bewitched .
she died when she was just 15 , " laments theresa .
when she was seven months pregnant by a married man , unia began going into convulsions or fits .
" we tried to counter this with herbal remedies , " theresa says .
unia 's unborn baby died in her womb and when she was finally taken to hospital it was too late for the doctors to save her . "
mothers often turn up at the clinic with a flask and pretend it is full of tea when in fact it contains traditional medicine " mary goretti ugandan midwife unia 's fits were symptoms of pre-eclampsia - a condition which is caused by high blood pressure during pregnancy .
but to this day , theresa 's family believe the jealous wife of unia 's baby 's father used herbs to bewitch her .
educating girls local midwife sarah nakitto , who works with the life saving skills project , says lessons can be learnt from these two deaths .
" they do n't know what can cause maternal mortality and what preventative measures can be taken .
" we have to educate people about family planning because unia was so young .
and her mother was delivering almost every year so if she had known more about family planning she would not have died , " she says .
theresa says girls ' education is the key to reducing maternal mortality in uganda .
" every girl should go to school - if a girl has education she can decide her own future , " says theresa , remembering that unia did n't even make it to the end of primary school when she became pregnant .
a high number of the maternal deaths are due to girls getting pregnant at a young age , mary goretti says .
" such girls often fear telling their parents that they are pregnant and so consult their fellow adolescents .
then they induce abortion by inserting objects in the vagina or they drink local remedies which often prove fatal , " she says .
uphill task the danger caused by unregulated traditional medicines is another challenge for the midwives .
chance of death in childbirth and pregnancy sierra leone , afghanistan : one in six angola , malawi , niger : one in seven nepal : one in 24 pakistan : one in 31 india : one in 48 uganda : one in 200 malaysia : one in 660 china : one in 830 us : one in 2,500 south korea : one in 2,800 britain : one in 3,300 japan : one in 6,000 sweden : one in 29,800 " mothers often turn up at the clinic with a flask and pretend it is full of tea when in fact it contains traditional medicine , " says mary goretti .
there are many factors contributing to high maternal mortality .
while better equipped health centres and more midwives in the rural areas would certainly help , general poverty is a major barrier .
it is not unheard of for health workers to demand payment before seeing a mother .
the midwives have an uphill task .
malaria and hiv / aids are both working against them and in the last five years the number of deaths has merely changed from 506 per 100,000 to 505 .
but the deaths of theresa 's daughter , mariam , and granddaughter , unia , could both have been prevented with better knowledge .
so the life saving skills team sees education as key and will continue to work with the entire community , including the men and those who use witchdoctors .
