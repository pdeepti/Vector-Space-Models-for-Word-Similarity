in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .
last year , the dark-haired beauty even launched her own jewelry collection .
küster has n't had her own career yet , but she has claimed that she would like to sing one day too . bohlen 's millions but with dieter bohlen as her husband , she wo n't have to work if she does n't want to : as well as the royalties flooding into his bank account from the 10-fold " modern talking " back catalogue , his memoirs " nichts als die wahrheit " -lrb- " nothing but the truth " -rrb- , was published last year and went straight to number one in the german book charts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musikproduzent dieter bohlen begleitet einen chor von saengern der sendung ' deutschland sucht den superstar ' in der zdf-show ' wetten , dass ... ? !

bohlen 's self-penned ditty is currently at number one in the german charts and looks like it wo n't be nudged off the top spot any time soon . and such is the strength of the dieter bohlen phenomenon in germany that he has even made it into academic circles .
a german professor at a brandenburg university recently used bohlen 's memoirs as the basis for an exam paper . " if one understands the book ' nothing but the truth ' as the soundtrack to the ' modern talking ' phenomenon , could you give the author a clue as to why he has n't managed to break the american market ?

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .
last year , the dark-haired beauty even launched her own jewelry collection .

a german professor at a brandenburg university recently used bohlen 's memoirs as the basis for an exam paper .

the base in the south western german state of rhineland palatinate is not just home to 5,000 u.s. airmen and women , but is also the region 's biggest employer . 800 german employees who live in the surrounding towns and villages work at the base and the presence of the u.s. military provides around 20,000 further jobs in the area , according to a recent study by the university of kaiserslautern .
nationwide , some 12,000 resident germans are directly employed by the american military in germany . but all these jobs could be under threat if rumors of a massive re-structuring of u.s. european military deployment are to be believed . last weekend , military planners from the u.s. delegation at the munich security conference suggested that plans were afoot to radically restructure its european military presence . the current 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany -lrb- 100,000 are stationed across europe in total -rrb- are deployed at sprawling , heavily staffed cold-war era style bases .

" i would call drawing any correlation between the german position on iraq and any plans to change deployment structures ' erroneous ' , " the spokesman said . fearing for their jobs but for the germans who work at spangdahlem , losing the base would mean losing their livelihood .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

the base in the south western german state of rhineland palatinate is not just home to 5,000 u.s. airmen and women , but is also the region 's biggest employer . 800 german employees who live in the surrounding towns and villages work at the base and the presence of the u.s. military provides around 20,000 further jobs in the area , according to a recent study by the university of kaiserslautern .
nationwide , some 12,000 resident germans are directly employed by the american military in germany . but all these jobs could be under threat if rumors of a massive re-structuring of u.s. european military deployment are to be believed . last weekend , military planners from the u.s. delegation at the munich security conference suggested that plans were afoot to radically restructure its european military presence . the current 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany -lrb- 100,000 are stationed across europe in total -rrb- are deployed at sprawling , heavily staffed cold-war era style bases .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .
last year , the dark-haired beauty even launched her own jewelry collection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.02.2003 war could help ease germany 's financial woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel concedes more spending may be necessary .
in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .

the base in the south western german state of rhineland palatinate is not just home to 5,000 u.s. airmen and women , but is also the region 's biggest employer . 800 german employees who live in the surrounding towns and villages work at the base and the presence of the u.s. military provides around 20,000 further jobs in the area , according to a recent study by the university of kaiserslautern .
nationwide , some 12,000 resident germans are directly employed by the american military in germany . but all these jobs could be under threat if rumors of a massive re-structuring of u.s. european military deployment are to be believed . last weekend , military planners from the u.s. delegation at the munich security conference suggested that plans were afoot to radically restructure its european military presence . the current 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany -lrb- 100,000 are stationed across europe in total -rrb- are deployed at sprawling , heavily staffed cold-war era style bases .
but , if the new proposals go ahead , such bases will be closed and u.s troops will be moved to lighter-staffed mobile units in cheaper eastern european countries , like hungary and poland .
the resulting savings would be spent on better housing and schooling for u.s military personnel , planners say . no concrete plans but the military in germany is strongly denying that there are any concrete plans as yet .
" there are currently no force structure changes being coordinated between the u.s. and germany , " a spokesman for the u.s. european command told dw-world . " given time , we have numerous plans regarding the most effective deployment of military worldwide , " and " in the event of any final decision regarding any changes , the german government will be consulted and public announcements made as soon as possible , " the spokesman said . the spokesperson also slammed press reports that the plans to take u.s. troops out of germany was linked to the current anti-war position taken by the german government .
" i would call drawing any correlation between the german position on iraq and any plans to change deployment structures ' erroneous ' , " the spokesman said . fearing for their jobs but for the germans who work at spangdahlem , losing the base would mean losing their livelihood .
a study by the university of kaiserslautern cites how the u.s. military presence in the region has become a fixed feature not just of economic but cultural life in the region . " it would be very bad if the base was to close , " christoph holkenbrink , mayor of wittlich-land , who represents 25 communities around the spangdahlem air base told dw-world .
" i would n't say that there is a sense of panic at the rumors , but there is a certain sense of uncertainty in the community , " holkenbrink said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”

not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

the base in the south western german state of rhineland palatinate is not just home to 5,000 u.s. airmen and women , but is also the region 's biggest employer . 800 german employees who live in the surrounding towns and villages work at the base and the presence of the u.s. military provides around 20,000 further jobs in the area , according to a recent study by the university of kaiserslautern .
nationwide , some 12,000 resident germans are directly employed by the american military in germany . but all these jobs could be under threat if rumors of a massive re-structuring of u.s. european military deployment are to be believed . last weekend , military planners from the u.s. delegation at the munich security conference suggested that plans were afoot to radically restructure its european military presence . the current 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany -lrb- 100,000 are stationed across europe in total -rrb- are deployed at sprawling , heavily staffed cold-war era style bases .
but , if the new proposals go ahead , such bases will be closed and u.s troops will be moved to lighter-staffed mobile units in cheaper eastern european countries , like hungary and poland .
the resulting savings would be spent on better housing and schooling for u.s military personnel , planners say . no concrete plans but the military in germany is strongly denying that there are any concrete plans as yet .
" there are currently no force structure changes being coordinated between the u.s. and germany , " a spokesman for the u.s. european command told dw-world . " given time , we have numerous plans regarding the most effective deployment of military worldwide , " and " in the event of any final decision regarding any changes , the german government will be consulted and public announcements made as soon as possible , " the spokesman said . the spokesperson also slammed press reports that the plans to take u.s. troops out of germany was linked to the current anti-war position taken by the german government .
" i would call drawing any correlation between the german position on iraq and any plans to change deployment structures ' erroneous ' , " the spokesman said . fearing for their jobs but for the germans who work at spangdahlem , losing the base would mean losing their livelihood .
a study by the university of kaiserslautern cites how the u.s. military presence in the region has become a fixed feature not just of economic but cultural life in the region . " it would be very bad if the base was to close , " christoph holkenbrink , mayor of wittlich-land , who represents 25 communities around the spangdahlem air base told dw-world .
" i would n't say that there is a sense of panic at the rumors , but there is a certain sense of uncertainty in the community , " holkenbrink said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.02.2003 war could help ease germany 's financial woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel concedes more spending may be necessary .
in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .

the base in the south western german state of rhineland palatinate is not just home to 5,000 u.s. airmen and women , but is also the region 's biggest employer . 800 german employees who live in the surrounding towns and villages work at the base and the presence of the u.s. military provides around 20,000 further jobs in the area , according to a recent study by the university of kaiserslautern .
nationwide , some 12,000 resident germans are directly employed by the american military in germany . but all these jobs could be under threat if rumors of a massive re-structuring of u.s. european military deployment are to be believed . last weekend , military planners from the u.s. delegation at the munich security conference suggested that plans were afoot to radically restructure its european military presence . the current 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany -lrb- 100,000 are stationed across europe in total -rrb- are deployed at sprawling , heavily staffed cold-war era style bases .
but , if the new proposals go ahead , such bases will be closed and u.s troops will be moved to lighter-staffed mobile units in cheaper eastern european countries , like hungary and poland .

" given time , we have numerous plans regarding the most effective deployment of military worldwide , " and " in the event of any final decision regarding any changes , the german government will be consulted and public announcements made as soon as possible , " the spokesman said . the spokesperson also slammed press reports that the plans to take u.s. troops out of germany was linked to the current anti-war position taken by the german government .
" i would call drawing any correlation between the german position on iraq and any plans to change deployment structures ' erroneous ' , " the spokesman said . fearing for their jobs but for the germans who work at spangdahlem , losing the base would mean losing their livelihood .
a study by the university of kaiserslautern cites how the u.s. military presence in the region has become a fixed feature not just of economic but cultural life in the region .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .
an editorial in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said , “ experience shows that such short-cited efforts soon fizzle : investors know that higher deficit spending today means higher taxes tomorrow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the base in the south western german state of rhineland palatinate is not just home to 5,000 u.s. airmen and women , but is also the region 's biggest employer . 800 german employees who live in the surrounding towns and villages work at the base and the presence of the u.s. military provides around 20,000 further jobs in the area , according to a recent study by the university of kaiserslautern .
nationwide , some 12,000 resident germans are directly employed by the american military in germany . but all these jobs could be under threat if rumors of a massive re-structuring of u.s. european military deployment are to be believed . last weekend , military planners from the u.s. delegation at the munich security conference suggested that plans were afoot to radically restructure its european military presence . the current 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany -lrb- 100,000 are stationed across europe in total -rrb- are deployed at sprawling , heavily staffed cold-war era style bases .
but , if the new proposals go ahead , such bases will be closed and u.s troops will be moved to lighter-staffed mobile units in cheaper eastern european countries , like hungary and poland .
the resulting savings would be spent on better housing and schooling for u.s military personnel , planners say . no concrete plans but the military in germany is strongly denying that there are any concrete plans as yet .
" there are currently no force structure changes being coordinated between the u.s. and germany , " a spokesman for the u.s. european command told dw-world . " given time , we have numerous plans regarding the most effective deployment of military worldwide , " and " in the event of any final decision regarding any changes , the german government will be consulted and public announcements made as soon as possible , " the spokesman said . the spokesperson also slammed press reports that the plans to take u.s. troops out of germany was linked to the current anti-war position taken by the german government .
" i would call drawing any correlation between the german position on iraq and any plans to change deployment structures ' erroneous ' , " the spokesman said . fearing for their jobs but for the germans who work at spangdahlem , losing the base would mean losing their livelihood .
a study by the university of kaiserslautern cites how the u.s. military presence in the region has become a fixed feature not just of economic but cultural life in the region . " it would be very bad if the base was to close , " christoph holkenbrink , mayor of wittlich-land , who represents 25 communities around the spangdahlem air base told dw-world .
" i would n't say that there is a sense of panic at the rumors , but there is a certain sense of uncertainty in the community , " holkenbrink said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .
last year , the dark-haired beauty even launched her own jewelry collection .
küster has n't had her own career yet , but she has claimed that she would like to sing one day too . bohlen 's millions but with dieter bohlen as her husband , she wo n't have to work if she does n't want to : as well as the royalties flooding into his bank account from the 10-fold " modern talking " back catalogue , his memoirs " nichts als die wahrheit " -lrb- " nothing but the truth " -rrb- , was published last year and went straight to number one in the german book charts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musikproduzent dieter bohlen begleitet einen chor von saengern der sendung ' deutschland sucht den superstar ' in der zdf-show ' wetten , dass ... ? ! ' am samstagabend , 25 .
januar 2003 , in boeblingen .
-lrb- ap photo / ralph orlowski , pool -rrb- he is doubtless also pocketing millions from the sales " we have a dream " , sung by the ten " superstar " finalists .
bohlen 's self-penned ditty is currently at number one in the german charts and looks like it wo n't be nudged off the top spot any time soon . and such is the strength of the dieter bohlen phenomenon in germany that he has even made it into academic circles .
a german professor at a brandenburg university recently used bohlen 's memoirs as the basis for an exam paper . " if one understands the book ' nothing but the truth ' as the soundtrack to the ' modern talking ' phenomenon , could you give the author a clue as to why he has n't managed to break the american market ? " the exam paper asked . the safe bet is that it has something to do with the tan , but it might be wise to consider the following : with bohlen having penned several hits for the eurovision song contest over the years , the real answer might be even closer to home . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reality tv still a hit in germany germany ’ s version of " pop idol " has the country on the edge of its seat , and now the german public service broadcaster has launched its own take on the postmodern talent show .

although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .

but , if the new proposals go ahead , such bases will be closed and u.s troops will be moved to lighter-staffed mobile units in cheaper eastern european countries , like hungary and poland .
the resulting savings would be spent on better housing and schooling for u.s military personnel , planners say . no concrete plans but the military in germany is strongly denying that there are any concrete plans as yet .
" there are currently no force structure changes being coordinated between the u.s. and germany , " a spokesman for the u.s. european command told dw-world . " given time , we have numerous plans regarding the most effective deployment of military worldwide , " and " in the event of any final decision regarding any changes , the german government will be consulted and public announcements made as soon as possible , " the spokesman said . the spokesperson also slammed press reports that the plans to take u.s. troops out of germany was linked to the current anti-war position taken by the german government .
" i would call drawing any correlation between the german position on iraq and any plans to change deployment structures ' erroneous ' , " the spokesman said . fearing for their jobs but for the germans who work at spangdahlem , losing the base would mean losing their livelihood .
a study by the university of kaiserslautern cites how the u.s. military presence in the region has become a fixed feature not just of economic but cultural life in the region . " it would be very bad if the base was to close , " christoph holkenbrink , mayor of wittlich-land , who represents 25 communities around the spangdahlem air base told dw-world .
" i would n't say that there is a sense of panic at the rumors , but there is a certain sense of uncertainty in the community , " holkenbrink said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .
last year , the dark-haired beauty even launched her own jewelry collection .
küster has n't had her own career yet , but she has claimed that she would like to sing one day too . bohlen 's millions but with dieter bohlen as her husband , she wo n't have to work if she does n't want to : as well as the royalties flooding into his bank account from the 10-fold " modern talking " back catalogue , his memoirs " nichts als die wahrheit " -lrb- " nothing but the truth " -rrb- , was published last year and went straight to number one in the german book charts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musikproduzent dieter bohlen begleitet einen chor von saengern der sendung ' deutschland sucht den superstar ' in der zdf-show ' wetten , dass ... ? !

-lrb- ap photo / ralph orlowski , pool -rrb- he is doubtless also pocketing millions from the sales " we have a dream " , sung by the ten " superstar " finalists .
bohlen 's self-penned ditty is currently at number one in the german charts and looks like it wo n't be nudged off the top spot any time soon . and such is the strength of the dieter bohlen phenomenon in germany that he has even made it into academic circles .
a german professor at a brandenburg university recently used bohlen 's memoirs as the basis for an exam paper . " if one understands the book ' nothing but the truth ' as the soundtrack to the ' modern talking ' phenomenon , could you give the author a clue as to why he has n't managed to break the american market ? " the exam paper asked . the safe bet is that it has something to do with the tan , but it might be wise to consider the following : with bohlen having penned several hits for the eurovision song contest over the years , the real answer might be even closer to home . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reality tv still a hit in germany germany ’ s version of " pop idol " has the country on the edge of its seat , and now the german public service broadcaster has launched its own take on the postmodern talent show .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .
last year , the dark-haired beauty even launched her own jewelry collection .
küster has n't had her own career yet , but she has claimed that she would like to sing one day too . bohlen 's millions but with dieter bohlen as her husband , she wo n't have to work if she does n't want to : as well as the royalties flooding into his bank account from the 10-fold " modern talking " back catalogue , his memoirs " nichts als die wahrheit " -lrb- " nothing but the truth " -rrb- , was published last year and went straight to number one in the german book charts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musikproduzent dieter bohlen begleitet einen chor von saengern der sendung ' deutschland sucht den superstar ' in der zdf-show ' wetten , dass ... ? !

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .
last year , the dark-haired beauty even launched her own jewelry collection .
küster has n't had her own career yet , but she has claimed that she would like to sing one day too . bohlen 's millions but with dieter bohlen as her husband , she wo n't have to work if she does n't want to : as well as the royalties flooding into his bank account from the 10-fold " modern talking " back catalogue , his memoirs " nichts als die wahrheit " -lrb- " nothing but the truth " -rrb- , was published last year and went straight to number one in the german book charts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musikproduzent dieter bohlen begleitet einen chor von saengern der sendung ' deutschland sucht den superstar ' in der zdf-show ' wetten , dass ... ? !

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .
an editorial in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said , “ experience shows that such short-cited efforts soon fizzle : investors know that higher deficit spending today means higher taxes tomorrow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .
last year , the dark-haired beauty even launched her own jewelry collection .
küster has n't had her own career yet , but she has claimed that she would like to sing one day too . bohlen 's millions but with dieter bohlen as her husband , she wo n't have to work if she does n't want to : as well as the royalties flooding into his bank account from the 10-fold " modern talking " back catalogue , his memoirs " nichts als die wahrheit " -lrb- " nothing but the truth " -rrb- , was published last year and went straight to number one in the german book charts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musikproduzent dieter bohlen begleitet einen chor von saengern der sendung ' deutschland sucht den superstar ' in der zdf-show ' wetten , dass ... ? ! ' am samstagabend , 25 .
januar 2003 , in boeblingen .
-lrb- ap photo / ralph orlowski , pool -rrb- he is doubtless also pocketing millions from the sales " we have a dream " , sung by the ten " superstar " finalists .
bohlen 's self-penned ditty is currently at number one in the german charts and looks like it wo n't be nudged off the top spot any time soon . and such is the strength of the dieter bohlen phenomenon in germany that he has even made it into academic circles .
a german professor at a brandenburg university recently used bohlen 's memoirs as the basis for an exam paper . " if one understands the book ' nothing but the truth ' as the soundtrack to the ' modern talking ' phenomenon , could you give the author a clue as to why he has n't managed to break the american market ? " the exam paper asked . the safe bet is that it has something to do with the tan , but it might be wise to consider the following : with bohlen having penned several hits for the eurovision song contest over the years , the real answer might be even closer to home . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reality tv still a hit in germany germany ’ s version of " pop idol " has the country on the edge of its seat , and now the german public service broadcaster has launched its own take on the postmodern talent show .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .

the resulting savings would be spent on better housing and schooling for u.s military personnel , planners say . no concrete plans but the military in germany is strongly denying that there are any concrete plans as yet .
" there are currently no force structure changes being coordinated between the u.s. and germany , " a spokesman for the u.s. european command told dw-world . " given time , we have numerous plans regarding the most effective deployment of military worldwide , " and " in the event of any final decision regarding any changes , the german government will be consulted and public announcements made as soon as possible , " the spokesman said . the spokesperson also slammed press reports that the plans to take u.s. troops out of germany was linked to the current anti-war position taken by the german government .
" i would call drawing any correlation between the german position on iraq and any plans to change deployment structures ' erroneous ' , " the spokesman said . fearing for their jobs but for the germans who work at spangdahlem , losing the base would mean losing their livelihood .
a study by the university of kaiserslautern cites how the u.s. military presence in the region has become a fixed feature not just of economic but cultural life in the region . " it would be very bad if the base was to close , " christoph holkenbrink , mayor of wittlich-land , who represents 25 communities around the spangdahlem air base told dw-world .
" i would n't say that there is a sense of panic at the rumors , but there is a certain sense of uncertainty in the community , " holkenbrink said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .
an editorial in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said , “ experience shows that such short-cited efforts soon fizzle : investors know that higher deficit spending today means higher taxes tomorrow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .
anders wanted to concentrate on his marriage , bohlen on his work .
indeed , he was a workaholic and already had a new music project in the pipeline .
" blue system " would see him produce a further 14 albums .
" for a number one hit , i gave everything .
i worked day and night , did n't take holidays and even went hungry , " he said . but like every pop god , bohlen has always had an eye for the ladies .
and his cheeky grin , piercing blue eyes and perma-tan has always ensured a steady flow of beautiful female companions . love rat ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bohlen 's current girlfriend is 23 year-old estefania küster -lrb- right -rrb- , who he now wants to marry and start a family with .
but küster is by no means his first and only love .
bohlen married his first wife , erika - who he met in a gottingen disco - in 1983 , and with whom he has three children .
although they divorced in 1994 , he has always maintained he has the most luck with women he meets in german nightspots , as was the case with another former girlfriend nadja abdel farrag .
" it happens that when i get to the disco , a crowd of girls gather around me , we speak , and i really have fun " , he declared once . his second marriage to verona feldbush in 1996 was short-lived and high profile .
having known the presenter of german erotic entertainment show " peep " for a mere two weeks , they married - and were divorced within a month .
verona later broke down uncontrollably on a german talk show , claiming that bohlen had hit her during their relationship . a down-side which may well have put many of bohlen 's female fans off the thought of a relationship with germany 's prince of pop : a recent survey of 18-45 year old german women published in german magazine schöne woche -lrb- " nice week " -rrb- revealed only seven percent of those asked would marry bohlen , believing him to be " their dream man , who looks good and has lots of money . "
the vast majority - 76 percent - said they would n't want to experience marital bliss with bohlen , while others believed he was an " arrogant snob " and a very wise five percent simply did n't want to go out with a man who had blond highlights . spawning a cottage industry for his former flames but despite the highlights , bohlen does have other saving graces : being one of dieter 's old flames has proved a guarantee to make the headlines in the german tabloid press and column inches in the german glossies . verona feldbush 's career sky-rocketed after her marriage to bohlen ended , when she went on to front her own show , " veronas welt " -lrb- " verona 's world " -rrb- .
she remains a regular on the german talk-show circuit and prime copy for magazine journalists all over the country .

pop idol judge dieter bohlen dieter bohlen , one of the jury members on the german version of " pop idol " and former " modern talking " singer , is one of germany 's most successful pop stars .
he has now even made it to the academic world . germany may not be swarming with a-list celebrities but of the few it has , they could n't come bigger , or more infamous than dieter bohlen . a walking advert for why one should n't use sun beds , the bronzed record-producer and singer is one half of one of germany 's biggest pop sensations , " modern talking " and is currently playing out his role as ' germany 's simon cowell . ' like cowell in britain before him - who is also a record producer and pop guru - 50 year-old bohlen is the acid-tongued juror on the german version of british reality tv show , " pop idol " : " deutschland sucht den superstar " -lrb- " germany searches for its superstar " . -rrb- the saturday night show which promises to take a hitherto undiscovered german who has to be able to sing and turn them into a " pop idol " , is currently netting audiences of over 10 million for german commercial channel rtl and is keeping bohlen firmly in the limelight . " modern talking " the son of a construction engineer , bohlen was born in 1954 in oldenburg in the northern german state of lower saxony .
after a childhood spent listening to the beatles and playing the guitar , he studied business management with the intention of taking over the family firm .
but the call of the stage was louder : music was to be his career . after a few false starts in the late 1970s and 1980s , bohlen formed the pop band " modern talking " with thomas anders in 1985 .
the pop-duo 's first single , " you 're my soul , you 're my heart " was the most played german single that year and sold over 8 million copies worldwide .
it turned the pair into stars overnight . top-ten hits followed and " modern talking " became the band which defined german pop in the 1980 's .
but success was not limited to germany .
the duo was a hit all over the continent .
their first album " the 1st album " and its follow-up " let 's talk about love " went platinum in germany and silver in denmark and switzerland . but artistic differences led to the end of the " modern talking " phenomenon in 1988 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.02.2003 war could help ease germany 's financial woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel concedes more spending may be necessary .
in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .
an editorial in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said , “ experience shows that such short-cited efforts soon fizzle : investors know that higher deficit spending today means higher taxes tomorrow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in an ironic turn of events , germany stands to benefit from a war with iraq - the european commission may cite it as a reason for suspending the stability and growth pact . a war with iraq may have an unintended positive side-effect for germany , helping the government get out of a sticky situation with the eu . in the event of a war , an „ exception clause “ in the stability and growth pact could be cited as a reason for suspending its criteria , giving germany a much needed reprieve : hefty fines for recent violations would be dismissed and the road for increased deficit spending to spur the economy would be cleared . in an interview on german tv last night , german finance minister hans eichel said that , should the economy deteriorate further , deficit spending may increase . voices within the finance ministry feel increased spending is necessary to stimulate the flagging economy . an insider told the german daily newspaper , tagesspiegel , “ if things get worse , we ’ re not going to drive ourselves further into the ground by saving . ”
an official social democratic paper advocates lower taxes and further investment in business , both of which mean bigger deficits . in response to reports that germany , france and england were hoping to invoke the clause , the european commission yesterday confirmed that it was not ruling out the possibility .
“ if there were to be a war we would look at any measures that were appropriate and might need to be taken , ” said an ec spokesman .
“ we ’ ll cross that bridge when we come to it . ” the so-called “ exception clause ” in the stability and growth pact states that should an “ unusual event outside the control of the member state concerned ” occur , the criteria could be suspended .
though this was meant to apply to natural disasters , it could be cited in the event of a war , something german officials are reportedly pushing for . keeping spending in check the growth and stability pact was created in 1997 to enforce financial discipline on the 12 member states of the monetary union .
the pact imposes a 3 percent of the gdp limit on budget deficit spending .
governments , whose budgets are not balanced within a year of violating the criteria , are subject to censure and heavy eu fines in excess of 10 million euros . germany became the second eu country to violate the criteria when finance officials announced last month that deficit spending had reached 3.75 percent of the gdp in 2002 -lrb- portugal was the first in november 2001 , with a deficit of 4.2 percent -rrb- .
german labor minster wolfgang clement ’ s subsequent announcement that the government was reducing the growth forecast from 1.5 percent to 1 percent indicated that germany would probably violate the criteria again in 2003 germany and portugal may soon be joined by france .
economists say deficit spending straddles the acceptable limit at 2.9 or 3 percent of the gdp . a need for reform ? it ’ s not surprising that france and germany , now joined by great britain , have led the charge to suspend the criteria .
their position , however , predates the situation with iraq .
though once a great supporter of the growth and stability pact , chancellor schroeder has - for many months now - been a critic , arguing that the criteria force austerity measures -lrb- budgets cuts and tax increases -rrb- , that can damage an already struggling economy . daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies in brussels , speculated in tagesspiegel that the german government was not only hoping to invoke the “ exception clause ” in the event of a war , but use the opportunity to push for wide-reaching reforms and a watering- down of the criteria . it 's a view that was mirrored in press reports in many german papers . in response , a spokesman for finance minister hans eichel denied the allegations saying , “ we are not talking at the moment about weakening or reinterpreting the growth and stability pact but how to adapt it to the current economic situation . ”
any revisions would be subject to the approval of ecofin , the european commission ’ s business and finance governing body . the debate over reform germany clearly stands to benefit - in the short term .
not only would the suspension of the criteria help germany avoid eu fines -lrb- and the possibility of violating the criteria for an embarrassing second year in a row -rrb- , it would free up finance officials to increase government spending to stimulate the struggling economy . critics argue that deficit spending could backfire , creating short term “ flash in the pan ” benefits while racking up long lasting debts .
an editorial in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said , “ experience shows that such short-cited efforts soon fizzle : investors know that higher deficit spending today means higher taxes tomorrow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the base in the south western german state of rhineland palatinate is not just home to 5,000 u.s. airmen and women , but is also the region 's biggest employer . 800 german employees who live in the surrounding towns and villages work at the base and the presence of the u.s. military provides around 20,000 further jobs in the area , according to a recent study by the university of kaiserslautern .
nationwide , some 12,000 resident germans are directly employed by the american military in germany . but all these jobs could be under threat if rumors of a massive re-structuring of u.s. european military deployment are to be believed . last weekend , military planners from the u.s. delegation at the munich security conference suggested that plans were afoot to radically restructure its european military presence . the current 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany -lrb- 100,000 are stationed across europe in total -rrb- are deployed at sprawling , heavily staffed cold-war era style bases .

the resulting savings would be spent on better housing and schooling for u.s military personnel , planners say . no concrete plans but the military in germany is strongly denying that there are any concrete plans as yet .

" i would call drawing any correlation between the german position on iraq and any plans to change deployment structures ' erroneous ' , " the spokesman said . fearing for their jobs but for the germans who work at spangdahlem , losing the base would mean losing their livelihood .

bbc news online asks the experts for their outlook .
professor andrew oswald of warwick university does n't believe in the underlying strength of the housing market . "
house market enthusiasts tell you to forget the boom-bust of the late eighties .
they argue things are different now as interest rates are lower .
but they are wrong and people buying now will end up counting the cost .
the average house price today is five times as much as the annual average wage .
historically , that is too high and the market will correct soon .
i predict the market will grow in the first half of this year by about 5 % .
then we will see stagnation followed by sharp falls .
in total , i believe prices will fall by 30 % during 2004 and 2005 .
the correction will be painful and long drawn out .
the current housing market is a little like the stock market during the first quarter of 2000 : price growth is driven by unrealistic sentiment .
it only takes enough people to question the sense in paying hundreds of thousands for a small property for the market to turn sour . "
the same day as the -lsb- interest -rsb- rate cut the seller decided my offer was not good enough , i upped it a little but i was determined not to be bounced into paying over the odds " adrian plant bbc news online first time buyer back in 1990 when house prices fell , the level of house sales completed was very small - people lost confidence and just stopped buying .
if history has taught us anything it is that the new paradigms of a rising market really do n't hold water .
and for those saying that low interest rates mean there can be no bust , i say look at hong kong .
in the former uk colony , property prices have fallen by two-thirds from their nineties peak but interest rates are only 1.5 % , less than half the rate of the uk 's current rate .
as for the recent bank of england rate cut , this will make matters worse not better .
it will further inflate the market making the pain harsher to bear when the inevitable price fall occurs . "
ray boulger senior technical manager at charcol mortgage advisers says house prices can keep on rising " from the early 1960s until recently , the uk had volatile and high inflation which resulted in volatile and high interest rates .
the key difference today is not only that we have low and stable inflation and low interest rates , but that this is expected to continue for the foreseeable future .
the most important factor to most people when deciding if they can afford their dream property is " what are the monthly payments ? "
on average , monthly mortgage payments are still very affordable and with interest rates stable or falling this situation will continue unless interest rates move up sharply and / or house prices continue rising much more quickly than earnings .
the current proportion of average earnings required to pay the average mortgage is well below previous highs and so , looked at in this context , house prices are not expensive .
historically , when average house prices rose to around five times average earnings , this was a sign that houses were overvalued .
however , i believe this ratio is redundant in the low inflation / low interest rate economy we now enjoy .
other factors are now much more relevant in assessing value . "
the current proportion of average earnings required to pay the average mortgage is well below previous highs " the irish experience provides a useful insight as to what is likely to happen in the uk .
ireland 's house price to earnings ratio fluctuated between similar levels to the uk until 1998 .
in the last four months of 1998 , irish interest rates halved from 6 % to 3 % prior to the euro launch on 1 january 1999 .
house prices continued to rise strongly and by 2000 the house price to earnings ratio had increased to six , sparking similar bearish comments on house prices to those now emanating from some commentators in the uk .
however , house prices kept increasing and the ratio is now nearly 8 , as the impact of their even lower interest rates has continued to improve affordability and hence property prices . "
have your say your comments it 's always the people involved with the property market who seem to have a bullish view , but they have the most to gain .
a elmas , japan / england i understand what ray is saying , but he is wrong , andrew is right , there is no such thing as " new " in economy , i believe that when this bubble bursts , it is going to be extremely nasty .
why do i think it will burst ? apart from the answer " its the economy , stupid " , basically even though monthly repayments are and will remain low , how can a first time buyer afford the deposit for such high prices ? and with first time buyers out of the market , it will have nowhere to go , the buy-to-lets will dump onto the market , and the spiral downwards will have begun !
as it is starting to in london -lrb- just read the comments made at the back of the next rics survey . very interesting reading ! -rrb-
christopher cook , surrey , uk i do n't agree with ray boulger .
how can house be so affordable when you have to borrow 5 or 6 times your salary ?
these pundits should remember two thirds of the working population are on less than average earnings !
also what about single people ?
if i borrowed the maximum on my salary , i would be paying about 45 % of my gross earnings in repayments .
it seems the country will be divided between property " haves " and property " have nots " if this market continues to rise .
richard , lancashire , uk a poll conducted by me amongst my friends suggests that those who currently own a house believe prices will stabilise and those who are hoping shortly to buy their first house believe prices will plummet .
tom disraeli , uk ray boulger is correct .
it all comes down to affordability , low inflation , low interest rates and unemployment , it would take a sharp rise in one or more of these to damper the current boom and who could argue that any of the above are waiting round the corner .
chris james , south africa one factor that rarely is mentioned in the likely influence of inherited property wealth coming to this generation .
given the uk 's ageing population and high property ownership levels this could be having a subtle yet strong influence on peoples buying habits .
mark , england i actually agree with both men -lrb- is this possible ? -rrb- .
ray boulger makes the point about low interest rates and affordability .
in the near term , while buying houses in affordable and lenders are offering long fixed rate mortgages , then people will be drawn into buying .
this will continue to sustain the housing boom until either people get complacent with the low interest rates , or something happens to the economy -lrb- historically this goes in cycles -rrb- .
if the interest rate starts to go up again , then people will be stuck , as the borrowing to income ratio is far too high .
so , as i see it , while interest rates continue to fall , people will have a false sense of security and continue to pay high prices for the next year or so .
if interest rates then go up , this will provide enough of a shock to the market which will see prices tumble .
the question is will the interest rate go up and if so , when ?
stefan gibney , uk and switzerland there will not be a crash in prices as we have moved into a new era of low interest rates and low inflation .
more and more people are stating to realise this and as such they are realising that they can afford to borrow more than they thought .
this in turn is helping maintain prices .
yes , there will probably be a slowing in growth this year and we may even see a few years of relatively flat growth -lrb- 3-5 % -rrb- .
however the key to the market is that interest payments remain manageable - this is the factor that the above economist does not recognise .
a.lee , sheffield , england i share andrew oswald 's view that the current housing boom is unsustainable .
one of the clear signs of an impending crash is unbridled optimism and opinions from experts justifying how and why the growth will be sustained .
one does not need to look beyond the internet bubble to see the ominous parallels .
suresh , england from the first time buyers perspective , there is a cost to not buying .
given that rent payments are essentially money down the drain , someone paying £ 600 per month rent can actually afford to buy and have their property value decline by up to £ 7k per year and still be better off .
so , for a first time buyer taking on a £ 100k property instead of paying £ 600pm rent , even the gloomy scenarios of 10 % -20 % declines over the next couple of years are actually not disastrous ... and of course things could improve and if first timers do n't act now they might find it even harder later .
rick , uk anybody can say that house prices will fall back and this stands to reason , but no one can actually say for certain when this will be .
many economists and experts have been predicting a crash for the last year but this has not happened yet , instead i understand that house prices have come down in london but risen in the rest of the country .
i would say that we are more likely to see a slowdown and that prices could remain static for some time though i would not like to speculate on when or how long this is likely to be ! !
steve , england i tend to agree with the professor .
each month the halifax and nationwide attempt to sustain an unsustainable market by producing misleading or selective statistics , simply because they are in denial , desperate to avoid the consequences of a meltdown .
that meltdown will occur , the only questions are when , and how severe it will be .
enough respected commentators -lrb- including the bank of england -rrb- continue to prepare us for the inevitable .
houses are only a commodity , and like the stock market subject to sentiment -lrb- where are the siren voices of 1999 tempting us with ever rising share values now ? -rrb- .
the " quick profit " mentality fuelled by popular tv programmes is already coming unstuck in the buy-to-let and speculative sectors , and the £ 1m plus london market is in steady decline .
only a fool -lrb- or someone with vested interests -rrb- continues chant the mantra " rising prices forever " denise mitchell , uk house prices will stay high simply because there is no other reasonably reliable investment .
people no longer trust the stock market , and are no longer paying as much in personal contributions into pension plans - what 's the point ?
partly as a result of this new short-termism , the banks must be awash with cash , so why on earth should interest rates rise ?
there is no cgt on one 's main property , whereas a pension is still taxed , eventually .
it all looks good for property as the only real short and long term investment .
in my opinion .
gil marais-gilchrist , england both professor andrew oswald and ray boulger offer plausible scenarios for the movement of future house prices .
for the individual buying a property in the current market , and i am one , the middle ground seems a sensible situation to hope for and expect .
i believe buying a house now will not give a return like those seen in recent years but equally buyers will not suffer huge losses like those of the early nineties .
paul , uk and usa as in any market scenario , there has to be a " catalyst " for change .
the 1989 housing market rise then crash was due to tax changes and subsequent rises in interest rates .
the catalyst for the 2000 stock market crash was an increase in interest rates .
there will have to be some factor which shakes people painfully out of the way they are thinking .
this would more than likely be an interest rake hike or a sharp increase in unemployment .
until the " catalyst " factor kicks in , prices will continue to rise .
colin larcombe , france i believe that neither of the above comments tell the whole story .
traditionally interest rates have been the key measure in the housing market , however the current upwards trend is i believe down to two things , firstly insecurity in the stock market leading to a shift to investing in property as opposed to shares , and secondly the changing mix of society - there are more single person buyers than in the past .
both of these factors lead to an increase in demand .
this is compounded by the supply of new properties being below the demand .
that is the key indicator , demand .
simple economics teaches us that when demand exceeds supply the price will rise .
i believe it is for this reason that the government recently announced initiatives to build large numbers of new houses , to stabilise the market .
andrew thomas , uk for the last year or so i 've seen the prices of even the smallest starter homes creep out of my price range .
as i have n't got a property to sell i 've felt the rise more harshly than those with a property that has risen in value as much as the home they 're buying .
so , if you 're a home owner already , the rise in house prices is not a big deal but it 's the first-time buyers , those who are being priced out of the market , who are going to force house prices down .
we simply ca n't buy houses and we wo n't buy houses in fear of a crash that will ruin us financially for life .
paul nattress , uk it does n't matter what the experts say , it boils down to what people are willing to pay .
when it comes to houses and people sense does not always prevail .
kenny , your experts rightly highlight affordability and sentiment as two key indicators in the housing market .
it seems to me that sentiment is the key criterion .
people will push the boat out if they feel bullish about the future .
combine a war in iraq with rising unemployment , and i think you will see a massive drop in sentiment .
30 % may be a little steep for a crash in 2003 - 2004 , but i would certainly think 10 % - 20 % is on the cards .
the only people talking up the housing market today are those involved in it - mortgage brokers , agents etc .
i suspect everyone else is terrified .
toby aldrich , uk people will continue to buy homes whilst the interest rates are low and affordable .
house prices will not drop until interest rates rise considerably and the cost of the monthly payments is beyond them .
si smith , uk i believe that the market will peak and then slowly and steadily decline .
the threat of war combined with manufacturing job losses will have a huge impact .
unemployment will rise in a number of industries and people will start spending more cautiously .
i think that as with the dot.com shares house prices are currently hugely over inflated and will inevitably have to drop as the people stop upgrading their accommodation .
nadina , uk both of your experts say things i understand but i find myself cherry picking from both scenarios to create the one which would suit me the best .
i have just sold my house in devon for 175 % of what i paid for it two years ago .
i do n't think that it will rise in value that quickly in the next two years but you never know ...
ian simmins , uk i do not feel that the market will crash as people will always need somewhere to live , however i am hoping that it does crash as a single person , trying to buy a house is impossible at the moment .
i earn a reasonable wage but mortgages are based on 2 wages .
i keep looking into this affordable housing that is being built but in hampshire a 1 bedroom affordable flat is £ 130k and i certainly can not get that mortgage on my own .
caroline hill , hamphire , uk what goes up , must come down and history does have a habit of repeating itself albeit never quite in the same way .
ray has certainly got one thing right , people do look at prices on the basis of what they can afford to pay each month rather than on the overall cost which , is fine if you are financing a new car over 3 years but foolish on a 25 year loan .
there are some interesting new factors to consider when prices start to soften this time round and the consequences are hard to guess .
in the last slump people were caught with negative equity , their loan being greater than the price they could sell for with the result that they either could not move or , if they did , had to carry with them an additional debt .
so the same thing will happen again except , this time , there wo n't be the benefit of inflation to reduce the real value of that debt over a short period .
the problem with low inflation is that the real value of any debt , is not eroded over time .
it is also probably true that existing home owners , rather than moving house , have taken equity out of their property via a remortgage , to spend on other things .
this type of deal has probably kept the high streets busy but , where that money has gone into buying a second property to rent out , there could be a lot of pain for the people concerned .
the rental market has already softened with landlords having to take " offers " on the rent which is no problem for those who bought such properties 10 years or so , ago .
for new landlords who have bought at inflated prices , the picture is not so good .
once prices start to fall , these people will feel the pain first which will probably lead to these properties coming onto the market to be sold , further depressing prices .
john , london , uk i think professor oswald is on the right path .
with so many first time buyers like myself being completely priced out of the housing market , house prices surely ca n't keep rising .
it is time people stopped using the average wage as a measure and instead used the wage of the average person .
nobody i know is on anywhere near the average wage -lrb- the figure is inaccurately high due to the ridiculous wage gap between high pay and average pay -rrb- .
as a result house prices in my area are actually around 8.5 times the average persons wage .
lee , birmingham , uk the hong kong example and the ireland example both cover times of extreme change for each respective country .
hong kong was going through the transition to chinese rule while ireland was being pumped full of eu money creating a " tiger " economy .
england is in a " normal " economic pattern where house prices long term are governed by multiples of earnings .
cost of borrowing will cause short / medium term highs and lows within this long term inflation based growth .
yes , the multiple may remain high , and may even go higher , but eventually the long term trend will prevail and force the multiple lower again .
aaron cowie , england i dont think that you can compare the housing market to the stock market as andrew has done .
we must remember that people actually want to buy houses to live in them , not just to make money .
i know many people in their twenties who would like to buy for the first time .
does this count for nothing ?
although i am following tom disrealis rule as i have just bought an inflated-price-house with my partner .
sarah philp , birmingham , uk i agree with the professor , prices are on the way down .
properties in richmond are becoming cheaper by the hour .
wake up the rest of the country because the ripple effect is happening big time in the traditionally expensive areas of london .
lisa , richmond , surrey the cheap credit available to property buyers is not only because of low boe rates , but also because banks and mortgage lenders regard this type of lending to be relatively risk free .
when more people start defaulting on their payments and losing their jobs , then the true risk of these loans will be revealed .
this will force lending rates / criteria up , even if boe rates continue to fall .
there is not only a bubble in house prices , but also one in bank lending to homeowners .
chris lucas , uk why does it matter , surely the prime requisite for some one bying a house should be as a roof over their head , not as an investment , this should be considered of secondary import .
if you buy as an investment , then like any investment , it is a gamble so do n't bleat if you lose ! .
as for the comment " ruined finacially for life " , do n't be so melodramtic , as long as you can keep up the mortgage payments you have a home , you may only loose money if you want to sell it , much like any other commodity .
chris , uk its not just the bottom rungs of the property ladder that are moving out of reach , all of the higher rungs are getting further apart .
as a home owner i would welcome some collapse in house prices because although our own house would be worth less , the amount of extra debt we would need to take on would be reduced .
getting the same house for less money seems like a good idea to me .
the only certain winners in this market are the banks .
guy roberts , uk at current interest rates , it 's just much cheaper for me to buy than to rent - even if i bought now , my mortgage would be only about 80 % of the cost of renting a similar property - with the advantage of course that i 'm investing in something i get to keep at the end of the day .
whilst this would change rapidly if interest rates changed , i think a -rrb- they 'd have to change quite a long way for it to tip that balance , and b -rrb- most buyers do n't think that long term. so i reckon prices will continue to rise for a while yet ... richard , uk no-one ever really mentions that britain is one of the few places where most people own their property .
on the continent renting is the norm for younger people .
although it is likely to worsen the rich-poor divide the huge amount of people with buy to let property may lead to a subtle shift away from owner occupation towards renting .
stuart , uk its important to see the big picture and look at the economy as a whole .
my particular point is employment .
although the office of national statistics claims unemployment is on the decrease , observations tell otherwise .
crucially , secure full-time jobs are decreasing , as are wages for the masses .
whilst a mean average wage may increase , there 's a strong bi-polar distribution .
the result is that fewer and fewer people have enough money to afford the exorbiant house prices , and hence demand falls , and prices plummet .
i would n't be at all surprised if andrew oswald 's prediction of a 30 % fall is optimistic - a 50 % decrease being more likley over the next 2-3 years .
jake gordon , england what this all really boils down to is public opinions .
as long as there is a continued increase in demand for housing , the laws of economics state that the prices will continue to rise .
all it would take to initiate a crash is for the balance of opinion to change and people to stop fuelling the demand .
people with a vested interest in keeping the market bouyant are propping it up with claims of sustained growth .
i would like to bet that rick , uk above , either works in the property trade or has just bought a house .
dan , uk property prices can only keep going up as occupancy rates drop .
with each new divorce , two homes are needed instead of one .
supply and demand dictate that as demand rises and supply does not , prices will rise .
tim johnston , southeast , england so we are told that " house prices rise as interest rates fall " is an immutable economic law that we can all rely on ?
so the three bed semi costing £ 250,000 at 4 % will increase to £ 500,000 at 2 % and £ 1 million at 1 % and . an infinite amount at 0 % because the interest repayments are zero ?
there surely comes a point when the absolute value for money in the property market is so poor in comparison with non property assets and the years of work and saving required to repay the capital , that the market is just not sustainable .
when that moment dawns on people , you really do n't want to be the person who just paid for someone else 's luxurious retirement to france -lrb- or anywhere with sensibly priced property -rrb- by buying their over priced house with a debt lasting 25 years .
if that semi reaches £ 1,000,000 - bonjour provence , au revoir south east england ! !
nigel curtress , surrey to all first time buyers , do n't do it , we fuel the market .
stop buying at ridiculous prices and realise when you are being ripped off .
sit back and wait for the fall and then select your bargain .
jan , uk another important consideration in house buying was - buy as high as you can afford , as your pay goes up your mortgage becomes more affordable .
hands up if you 've had a pay rise in the last couple of years .
no ?
i did n't think so .
ps national insurance contributions go up in april so you 'll have even less take-home pay .
darryl , uk it is obvious to me that house prices can not rise at a rate of 25 % indefinatly .
when the average pay rise is arround 4 % , it stands to reason that their has to be a slowdown at the very least .
paul , england i agree with the professor , and believe that apart from the inevitable movement upwards in interest rates at some point , affordability will also be severely hit by the forthcoming increase in national insurance contributions , increase upon increase in council taxes -lrb- both immediately and following the proposed re-banding of properties -rrb- , future tax increases necessary to meet the government 's spending plans and budget deficit , and consumers having to eventually pay their record level credit card bills .
kevin welch , england i agree with lisa 's comments from richmond .
london prices are falling , people are losing confidence in the market .
estate agents are not telling purchasers that the prices have been reduced .
however , they are often lapse in updating their websites and the discounts being offered are only too visbile .
the rest of the country will experience this in time and we will see a repeat of the last housing market crash .
during the last crash people kicked themselves for not seeing it coming .
the warning signs are there , proceed with caution .
rob , london it might be a an idea to look at the morals of the lenders and estate agents.after the fiasco of the early nineties of people losing all they had and some that are still paying for it.they -lrb- the lenders and estate agents -rrb- are the ones that are again driving the market instead of letting it cool down.rules should be put in place to tighten the reigns of house buyers and to explain the financial consequences of a bad fall in the housing market.a home is for living in and to hopefully bring up a family.how do we expect the younger generation to have children with such a large noose round their necks .
nobody knows the future including the two guys in this debate but we could all pull together for a solution to this question .
david , england as someone currently looking for a first house , i would love the market to drop substantially .
but there are many people in my position .
if prices start to drop , some of those people will then be able to afford what they could n't afford before .
they 'll start buying and that will push prices back up .
unless of course some other factor -lrb- mass unemployment , high interest rates -rrb- means that they still ca n't afford the lower prices .
perhaps if all first time buyers could unite & agree not to buy anything for the next 6 months , there would be a nice sharp drop ! !
but i suspect that wo n't happen .
emma , uk house prices have been stagnant in the part of hampshire where i live for the last five months and i 'm beginning to see reduced signs in estate agent 's windows .
one shop keeper i was talking to , has been trying to sell his house for the last four months with no takers .
i do n't think house prices will crash where i live but i do n't think they willl rise any more either , regardless of whether interest rates fall further or not ranj , uk recession is inevitable as the finance industry does n't accept a good year as being such .
people only have so much money , and when it 's gone and the credit card 's full and interest builds up , repayments can only come from monthly essentials like mortgages .
that 's the cycle of life - you have to ride the peaks , but the troughs are always there !
nick , uk most people agree with andrew but the reality agrees with ray .
how long must people wait for the crash ?
could this problem be averted by moving jobs to other parts of britain ?
it will increase demand in those areas but the overall demand will even out .
alternatively , build more flats -lrb- aiming at the increasing single population -rrb- .
remember the cartoon character who runs off the cliff and does n't realise it , their legs thrashing around for a few seconds before falling to earth .
that is todays situation but the seconds could be years .
jason , england i can not possibly see how the housing market can continue to increase .
i have been looking for a property as a first time buyer for sometime now and can see no light at the end of this miserable tunnel .
so what if the interest rates have been cut .
it still does not help me to get a mortgage .
as a single person and on a wage which is above the national average i still would not be able to get a suitable mortgage to afford to buy a property where i live .
not only that the repayments per month alone would be more than renting a property .
therefore what hope have first time buyers got .
surely without us to fuel the housing market how can there not be a decline in house prices ?
olivia , england who do you think has called the market correctly ?
are we heading for a crash or is growth going to continue ?

bbc news online asks the experts for their outlook .
professor andrew oswald of warwick university does n't believe in the underlying strength of the housing market .
house market enthusiasts tell you to forget the boom-bust of the late eighties .
they argue things are different now as interest rates are lower .
but they are wrong and people buying now will end up counting the cost .
andrew oswald : will the uk market follow hong kong market the average house price today is five times as much as the annual average wage .
historically , that is too high and the market will correct soon .
i predict the market will grow in the first half of this year by about 5 % .
then we will see stagnation followed by sharp falls .
in total , i believe prices will fall by 30 % during 2004 and 2005 .
the correction will be painful and long drawn out .
the current housing market is a little like the stock market during the first quarter of 2000 : price growth is driven by unrealistic sentiment .
it only takes enough people to question the sense in paying hundreds of thousands for a small property for the market to turn sour .
the same day as the -lsb- interest -rsb- rate cut the seller decided my offer was not good enough , i upped it a little but i was determined not to be bounced into paying over the odds adrian plant bbc news online first time buyer follow adrian 's story back in 1990 when house prices fell , the level of house sales completed was very small - people lost confidence and just stopped buying .
if history has taught us anything it is that the new paradigms of a rising market really do n't hold water .
and for those saying that low interest rates mean there can be no bust , i say look at hong kong .
in the former uk colony , property prices have fallen by two-thirds from their nineties peak but interest rates are only 1.5 % , less than half the rate of the uk 's current rate .
as for the recent bank of england rate cut , this will make matters worse not better .
it will further inflate the market making the pain harsher to bear when the inevitable price fall occurs .
ray boulger senior technical manager at charcol mortgage advisers says house prices can keep on rising from the early 1960s until recently , the uk had volatile and high inflation which resulted in volatile and high interest rates .
the key difference today is not only that we have low and stable inflation and low interest rates , but that this is expected to continue for the foreseeable future .
ray boulger : will the british have the luck of the irish ?
the most important factor to most people when deciding if they can afford their dream property is " what are the monthly payments ? "
on average , monthly mortgage payments are still very affordable and with interest rates stable or falling this situation will continue unless interest rates move up sharply and / or house prices continue rising much more quickly than earnings .
the current proportion of average earnings required to pay the average mortgage is well below previous highs and so , looked at in this context , house prices are not expensive .
historically , when average house prices rose to around five times average earnings , this was a sign that houses were overvalued .
however , i believe this ratio is redundant in the low inflation / low interest rate economy we now enjoy .
other factors are now much more relevant in assessing value .
the current proportion of average earnings required to pay the average mortgage is well below previous highs the irish experience provides a useful insight as to what is likely to happen in the uk .
ireland 's house price to earnings ratio fluctuated between similar levels to the uk until 1998 .
in the last four months of 1998 , irish interest rates halved from 6 % to 3 % prior to the euro launch on 1 january 1999 .
house prices continued to rise strongly and by 2000 the house price to earnings ratio had increased to six , sparking similar bearish comments on house prices to those now emanating from some commentators in the uk .
however , house prices kept increasing and the ratio is now nearly 8 , as the impact of their even lower interest rates has continued to improve affordability and hence property prices .
your comments it 's always the people involved with the property market who seem to have a bullish view , but they have the most to gain .
a elmas , japan / england i understand what ray is saying , but he is wrong , andrew is right , there is no such thing as " new " in economy , i believe that when this bubble bursts , it is going to be extremely nasty .
why do i think it will burst ? apart from the answer " its the economy , stupid " , basically even though monthly repayments are and will remain low , how can a first time buyer afford the deposit for such high prices ? and with first time buyers out of the market , it will have nowhere to go , the buy-to-lets will dump onto the market , and the spiral downwards will have begun !
as it is starting to in london -lrb- just read the comments made at the back of the next rics survey . very interesting reading ! -rrb-
christopher cook , surrey , uk i do n't agree with ray boulger .
how can house be so affordable when you have to borrow 5 or 6 times your salary ?
these pundits should remember two thirds of the working population are on less than average earnings !
also what about single people ?
if i borrowed the maximum on my salary , i would be paying about 45 % of my gross earnings in repayments .
it seems the country will be divided between property " haves " and property " have nots " if this market continues to rise .
richard , lancashire , uk a poll conducted by me amongst my friends suggests that those who currently own a house believe prices will stabilise and those who are hoping shortly to buy their first house believe prices will plummet .
tom disraeli , uk ray boulger is correct .
it all comes down to affordability , low inflation , low interest rates and unemployment , it would take a sharp rise in one or more of these to damper the current boom and who could argue that any of the above are waiting round the corner .
chris james , south africa one factor that rarely is mentioned in the likely influence of inherited property wealth coming to this generation .
given the uk 's ageing population and high property ownership levels this could be having a subtle yet strong influence on peoples buying habits .
mark , england i actually agree with both men -lrb- is this possible ? -rrb- .
ray boulger makes the point about low interest rates and affordability .
in the near term , while buying houses in affordable and lenders are offering long fixed rate mortgages , then people will be drawn into buying .
this will continue to sustain the housing boom until either people get complacent with the low interest rates , or something happens to the economy -lrb- historically this goes in cycles -rrb- .
if the interest rate starts to go up again , then people will be stuck , as the borrowing to income ratio is far too high .
so , as i see it , while interest rates continue to fall , people will have a false sense of security and continue to pay high prices for the next year or so .
if interest rates then go up , this will provide enough of a shock to the market which will see prices tumble .
the question is will the interest rate go up and if so , when ?
stefan gibney , uk and switzerland there will not be a crash in prices as we have moved into a new era of low interest rates and low inflation .
more and more people are stating to realise this and as such they are realising that they can afford to borrow more than they thought .
this in turn is helping maintain prices .
yes , there will probably be a slowing in growth this year and we may even see a few years of relatively flat growth -lrb- 3-5 % -rrb- .
however the key to the market is that interest payments remain manageable - this is the factor that the above economist does not recognise .
a.lee , sheffield , england i share andrew oswald 's view that the current housing boom is unsustainable .
one of the clear signs of an impending crash is unbridled optimism and opinions from experts justifying how and why the growth will be sustained .
one does not need to look beyond the internet bubble to see the ominous parallels .
suresh , england from the first time buyers perspective , there is a cost to not buying .
given that rent payments are essentially money down the drain , someone paying £ 600 per month rent can actually afford to buy and have their property value decline by up to £ 7k per year and still be better off .
so , for a first time buyer taking on a £ 100k property instead of paying £ 600pm rent , even the gloomy scenarios of 10 % -20 % declines over the next couple of years are actually not disastrous ... and of course things could improve and if first timers do n't act now they might find it even harder later .
rick , uk anybody can say that house prices will fall back and this stands to reason , but no one can actually say for certain when this will be .
many economists and experts have been predicting a crash for the last year but this has not happened yet , instead i understand that house prices have come down in london but risen in the rest of the country .
i would say that we are more likely to see a slowdown and that prices could remain static for some time though i would not like to speculate on when or how long this is likely to be ! !
steve , england i tend to agree with the professor .
each month the halifax and nationwide attempt to sustain an unsustainable market by producing misleading or selective statistics , simply because they are in denial , desperate to avoid the consequences of a meltdown .
that meltdown will occur , the only questions are when , and how severe it will be .
enough respected commentators -lrb- including the bank of england -rrb- continue to prepare us for the inevitable .
houses are only a commodity , and like the stock market subject to sentiment -lrb- where are the siren voices of 1999 tempting us with ever rising share values now ? -rrb- .
the " quick profit " mentality fuelled by popular tv programmes is already coming unstuck in the buy-to-let and speculative sectors , and the £ 1m plus london market is in steady decline .
only a fool -lrb- or someone with vested interests -rrb- continues chant the mantra " rising prices forever " denise mitchell , uk house prices will stay high simply because there is no other reasonably reliable investment .
people no longer trust the stock market , and are no longer paying as much in personal contributions into pension plans - what 's the point ?
partly as a result of this new short-termism , the banks must be awash with cash , so why on earth should interest rates rise ?
there is no cgt on one 's main property , whereas a pension is still taxed , eventually .
it all looks good for property as the only real short and long term investment .
in my opinion .
gil marais-gilchrist , england both professor andrew oswald and ray boulger offer plausible scenarios for the movement of future house prices .
for the individual buying a property in the current market , and i am one , the middle ground seems a sensible situation to hope for and expect .
i believe buying a house now will not give a return like those seen in recent years but equally buyers will not suffer huge losses like those of the early nineties .
paul , uk and usa as in any market scenario , there has to be a " catalyst " for change .
the 1989 housing market rise then crash was due to tax changes and subsequent rises in interest rates .
the catalyst for the 2000 stock market crash was an increase in interest rates .
there will have to be some factor which shakes people painfully out of the way they are thinking .
this would more than likely be an interest rake hike or a sharp increase in unemployment .
until the " catalyst " factor kicks in , prices will continue to rise .
colin larcombe , france i believe that neither of the above comments tell the whole story .
traditionally interest rates have been the key measure in the housing market , however the current upwards trend is i believe down to two things , firstly insecurity in the stock market leading to a shift to investing in property as opposed to shares , and secondly the changing mix of society - there are more single person buyers than in the past .
both of these factors lead to an increase in demand .
this is compounded by the supply of new properties being below the demand .
that is the key indicator , demand .
simple economics teaches us that when demand exceeds supply the price will rise .
i believe it is for this reason that the government recently announced initiatives to build large numbers of new houses , to stabilise the market .
andrew thomas , uk for the last year or so i 've seen the prices of even the smallest starter homes creep out of my price range .
as i have n't got a property to sell i 've felt the rise more harshly than those with a property that has risen in value as much as the home they 're buying .
so , if you 're a home owner already , the rise in house prices is not a big deal but it 's the first-time buyers , those who are being priced out of the market , who are going to force house prices down .
we simply ca n't buy houses and we wo n't buy houses in fear of a crash that will ruin us financially for life .
paul nattress , uk it does n't matter what the experts say , it boils down to what people are willing to pay .
when it comes to houses and people sense does not always prevail .
kenny , your experts rightly highlight affordability and sentiment as two key indicators in the housing market .
it seems to me that sentiment is the key criterion .
people will push the boat out if they feel bullish about the future .
combine a war in iraq with rising unemployment , and i think you will see a massive drop in sentiment .
30 % may be a little steep for a crash in 2003 - 2004 , but i would certainly think 10 % - 20 % is on the cards .
the only people talking up the housing market today are those involved in it - mortgage brokers , agents etc .
i suspect everyone else is terrified .
toby aldrich , uk people will continue to buy homes whilst the interest rates are low and affordable .
house prices will not drop until interest rates rise considerably and the cost of the monthly payments is beyond them .
si smith , uk i believe that the market will peak and then slowly and steadily decline .
the threat of war combined with manufacturing job losses will have a huge impact .
unemployment will rise in a number of industries and people will start spending more cautiously .
i think that as with the dot.com shares house prices are currently hugely over inflated and will inevitably have to drop as the people stop upgrading their accommodation .
nadina , uk both of your experts say things i understand but i find myself cherry picking from both scenarios to create the one which would suit me the best .
i have just sold my house in devon for 175 % of what i paid for it two years ago .
i do n't think that it will rise in value that quickly in the next two years but you never know ...
ian simmins , uk i do not feel that the market will crash as people will always need somewhere to live , however i am hoping that it does crash as a single person , trying to buy a house is impossible at the moment .
i earn a reasonable wage but mortgages are based on 2 wages .
i keep looking into this affordable housing that is being built but in hampshire a 1 bedroom affordable flat is £ 130k and i certainly can not get that mortgage on my own .
caroline hill , hamphire , uk what goes up , must come down and history does have a habit of repeating itself albeit never quite in the same way .
ray has certainly got one thing right , people do look at prices on the basis of what they can afford to pay each month rather than on the overall cost which , is fine if you are financing a new car over 3 years but foolish on a 25 year loan .
there are some interesting new factors to consider when prices start to soften this time round and the consequences are hard to guess .
in the last slump people were caught with negative equity , their loan being greater than the price they could sell for with the result that they either could not move or , if they did , had to carry with them an additional debt .
so the same thing will happen again except , this time , there wo n't be the benefit of inflation to reduce the real value of that debt over a short period .
the problem with low inflation is that the real value of any debt , is not eroded over time .
it is also probably true that existing home owners , rather than moving house , have taken equity out of their property via a remortgage , to spend on other things .
this type of deal has probably kept the high streets busy but , where that money has gone into buying a second property to rent out , there could be a lot of pain for the people concerned .
the rental market has already softened with landlords having to take " offers " on the rent which is no problem for those who bought such properties 10 years or so , ago .
for new landlords who have bought at inflated prices , the picture is not so good .
once prices start to fall , these people will feel the pain first which will probably lead to these properties coming onto the market to be sold , further depressing prices .
john , london , uk i think professor oswald is on the right path .
with so many first time buyers like myself being completely priced out of the housing market , house prices surely ca n't keep rising .
it is time people stopped using the average wage as a measure and instead used the wage of the average person .
nobody i know is on anywhere near the average wage -lrb- the figure is inaccurately high due to the ridiculous wage gap between high pay and average pay -rrb- .
as a result house prices in my area are actually around 8.5 times the average persons wage .
lee , birmingham , uk the hong kong example and the ireland example both cover times of extreme change for each respective country .
hong kong was going through the transition to chinese rule while ireland was being pumped full of eu money creating a " tiger " economy .
england is in a " normal " economic pattern where house prices long term are governed by multiples of earnings .
cost of borrowing will cause short / medium term highs and lows within this long term inflation based growth .
yes , the multiple may remain high , and may even go higher , but eventually the long term trend will prevail and force the multiple lower again .
aaron cowie , england i dont think that you can compare the housing market to the stock market as andrew has done .
we must remember that people actually want to buy houses to live in them , not just to make money .
i know many people in their twenties who would like to buy for the first time .
does this count for nothing ?
although i am following tom disrealis rule as i have just bought an inflated-price-house with my partner .
sarah philp , birmingham , uk i agree with the professor , prices are on the way down .
properties in richmond are becoming cheaper by the hour .
wake up the rest of the country because the ripple effect is happening big time in the traditionally expensive areas of london .
lisa , richmond , surrey the cheap credit available to property buyers is not only because of low boe rates , but also because banks and mortgage lenders regard this type of lending to be relatively risk free .
when more people start defaulting on their payments and losing their jobs , then the true risk of these loans will be revealed .
this will force lending rates / criteria up , even if boe rates continue to fall .
there is not only a bubble in house prices , but also one in bank lending to homeowners .
chris lucas , uk why does it matter , surely the prime requisite for some one bying a house should be as a roof over their head , not as an investment , this should be considered of secondary import .
if you buy as an investment , then like any investment , it is a gamble so do n't bleat if you lose ! .
as for the comment " ruined finacially for life " , do n't be so melodramtic , as long as you can keep up the mortgage payments you have a home , you may only loose money if you want to sell it , much like any other commodity .
chris , uk its not just the bottom rungs of the property ladder that are moving out of reach , all of the higher rungs are getting further apart .
as a home owner i would welcome some collapse in house prices because although our own house would be worth less , the amount of extra debt we would need to take on would be reduced .
getting the same house for less money seems like a good idea to me .
the only certain winners in this market are the banks .
guy roberts , uk at current interest rates , it 's just much cheaper for me to buy than to rent - even if i bought now , my mortgage would be only about 80 % of the cost of renting a similar property - with the advantage of course that i 'm investing in something i get to keep at the end of the day .
whilst this would change rapidly if interest rates changed , i think a -rrb- they 'd have to change quite a long way for it to tip that balance , and b -rrb- most buyers do n't think that long term. so i reckon prices will continue to rise for a while yet ... richard , uk no-one ever really mentions that britain is one of the few places where most people own their property .
on the continent renting is the norm for younger people .
although it is likely to worsen the rich-poor divide the huge amount of people with buy to let property may lead to a subtle shift away from owner occupation towards renting .
stuart , uk its important to see the big picture and look at the economy as a whole .
my particular point is employment .
although the office of national statistics claims unemployment is on the decrease , observations tell otherwise .
crucially , secure full-time jobs are decreasing , as are wages for the masses .
whilst a mean average wage may increase , there 's a strong bi-polar distribution .
the result is that fewer and fewer people have enough money to afford the exorbiant house prices , and hence demand falls , and prices plummet .
i would n't be at all surprised if andrew oswald 's prediction of a 30 % fall is optimistic - a 50 % decrease being more likley over the next 2-3 years .
jake gordon , england what this all really boils down to is public opinions .
as long as there is a continued increase in demand for housing , the laws of economics state that the prices will continue to rise .
all it would take to initiate a crash is for the balance of opinion to change and people to stop fuelling the demand .
people with a vested interest in keeping the market bouyant are propping it up with claims of sustained growth .
i would like to bet that rick , uk above , either works in the property trade or has just bought a house .
dan , uk property prices can only keep going up as occupancy rates drop .
with each new divorce , two homes are needed instead of one .
supply and demand dictate that as demand rises and supply does not , prices will rise .
tim johnston , southeast , england so we are told that " house prices rise as interest rates fall " is an immutable economic law that we can all rely on ?
so the three bed semi costing £ 250,000 at 4 % will increase to £ 500,000 at 2 % and £ 1 million at 1 % and . an infinite amount at 0 % because the interest repayments are zero ?
there surely comes a point when the absolute value for money in the property market is so poor in comparison with non property assets and the years of work and saving required to repay the capital , that the market is just not sustainable .
when that moment dawns on people , you really do n't want to be the person who just paid for someone else 's luxurious retirement to france -lrb- or anywhere with sensibly priced property -rrb- by buying their over priced house with a debt lasting 25 years .
if that semi reaches £ 1,000,000 - bonjour provence , au revoir south east england ! !
nigel curtress , surrey to all first time buyers , do n't do it , we fuel the market .
stop buying at ridiculous prices and realise when you are being ripped off .
sit back and wait for the fall and then select your bargain .
jan , uk another important consideration in house buying was - buy as high as you can afford , as your pay goes up your mortgage becomes more affordable .
hands up if you 've had a pay rise in the last couple of years .
no ?
i did n't think so .
ps national insurance contributions go up in april so you 'll have even less take-home pay .
darryl , uk it is obvious to me that house prices can not rise at a rate of 25 % indefinatly .
when the average pay rise is arround 4 % , it stands to reason that their has to be a slowdown at the very least .
paul , england i agree with the professor , and believe that apart from the inevitable movement upwards in interest rates at some point , affordability will also be severely hit by the forthcoming increase in national insurance contributions , increase upon increase in council taxes -lrb- both immediately and following the proposed re-banding of properties -rrb- , future tax increases necessary to meet the government 's spending plans and budget deficit , and consumers having to eventually pay their record level credit card bills .
kevin welch , england i agree with lisa 's comments from richmond .
london prices are falling , people are losing confidence in the market .
estate agents are not telling purchasers that the prices have been reduced .
however , they are often lapse in updating their websites and the discounts being offered are only too visbile .
the rest of the country will experience this in time and we will see a repeat of the last housing market crash .
during the last crash people kicked themselves for not seeing it coming .
the warning signs are there , proceed with caution .
rob , london it might be a an idea to look at the morals of the lenders and estate agents.after the fiasco of the early nineties of people losing all they had and some that are still paying for it.they -lrb- the lenders and estate agents -rrb- are the ones that are again driving the market instead of letting it cool down.rules should be put in place to tighten the reigns of house buyers and to explain the financial consequences of a bad fall in the housing market.a home is for living in and to hopefully bring up a family.how do we expect the younger generation to have children with such a large noose round their necks .
nobody knows the future including the two guys in this debate but we could all pull together for a solution to this question .
david , england as someone currently looking for a first house , i would love the market to drop substantially .
but there are many people in my position .
if prices start to drop , some of those people will then be able to afford what they could n't afford before .
they 'll start buying and that will push prices back up .
unless of course some other factor -lrb- mass unemployment , high interest rates -rrb- means that they still ca n't afford the lower prices .
perhaps if all first time buyers could unite & agree not to buy anything for the next 6 months , there would be a nice sharp drop ! !
but i suspect that wo n't happen .
emma , uk house prices have been stagnant in the part of hampshire where i live for the last five months and i 'm beginning to see reduced signs in estate agent 's windows .
one shop keeper i was talking to , has been trying to sell his house for the last four months with no takers .
i do n't think house prices will crash where i live but i do n't think they willl rise any more either , regardless of whether interest rates fall further or not ranj , uk recession is inevitable as the finance industry does n't accept a good year as being such .
people only have so much money , and when it 's gone and the credit card 's full and interest builds up , repayments can only come from monthly essentials like mortgages .
that 's the cycle of life - you have to ride the peaks , but the troughs are always there !
nick , uk most people agree with andrew but the reality agrees with ray .
how long must people wait for the crash ?
could this problem be averted by moving jobs to other parts of britain ?
it will increase demand in those areas but the overall demand will even out .
alternatively , build more flats -lrb- aiming at the increasing single population -rrb- .
remember the cartoon character who runs off the cliff and does n't realise it , their legs thrashing around for a few seconds before falling to earth .
that is todays situation but the seconds could be years .
jason , england i can not possibly see how the housing market can continue to increase .
i have been looking for a property as a first time buyer for sometime now and can see no light at the end of this miserable tunnel .
so what if the interest rates have been cut .
it still does not help me to get a mortgage .
as a single person and on a wage which is above the national average i still would not be able to get a suitable mortgage to afford to buy a property where i live .
not only that the repayments per month alone would be more than renting a property .
therefore what hope have first time buyers got .
surely without us to fuel the housing market how can there not be a decline in house prices ?
olivia , england who do you think has called the market correctly ?
are we heading for a crash or is growth going to continue ?

bbc news online asks the experts for their outlook .
professor andrew oswald of warwick university does n't believe in the underlying strength of the housing market .
house market enthusiasts tell you to forget the boom-bust of the late eighties .
they argue things are different now as interest rates are lower .
but they are wrong and people buying now will end up counting the cost .
andrew oswald : will the uk market follow hong kong market the average house price today is five times as much as the annual average wage .
historically , that is too high and the market will correct soon .
i predict the market will grow in the first half of this year by about 5 % .
then we will see stagnation followed by sharp falls .
in total , i believe prices will fall by 30 % during 2004 and 2005 .
the correction will be painful and long drawn out .
the current housing market is a little like the stock market during the first quarter of 2000 : price growth is driven by unrealistic sentiment .
it only takes enough people to question the sense in paying hundreds of thousands for a small property for the market to turn sour .
the same day as the -lsb- interest -rsb- rate cut the seller decided my offer was not good enough , i upped it a little but i was determined not to be bounced into paying over the odds adrian plant bbc news online first time buyer follow adrian 's story back in 1990 when house prices fell , the level of house sales completed was very small - people lost confidence and just stopped buying .
if history has taught us anything it is that the new paradigms of a rising market really do n't hold water .
and for those saying that low interest rates mean there can be no bust , i say look at hong kong .
in the former uk colony , property prices have fallen by two-thirds from their nineties peak but interest rates are only 1.5 % , less than half the rate of the uk 's current rate .
as for the recent bank of england rate cut , this will make matters worse not better .
it will further inflate the market making the pain harsher to bear when the inevitable price fall occurs .
ray boulger senior technical manager at charcol mortgage advisers says house prices can keep on rising from the early 1960s until recently , the uk had volatile and high inflation which resulted in volatile and high interest rates .
the key difference today is not only that we have low and stable inflation and low interest rates , but that this is expected to continue for the foreseeable future .
ray boulger : will the british have the luck of the irish ?
the most important factor to most people when deciding if they can afford their dream property is " what are the monthly payments ? "
on average , monthly mortgage payments are still very affordable and with interest rates stable or falling this situation will continue unless interest rates move up sharply and / or house prices continue rising much more quickly than earnings .
the current proportion of average earnings required to pay the average mortgage is well below previous highs and so , looked at in this context , house prices are not expensive .
historically , when average house prices rose to around five times average earnings , this was a sign that houses were overvalued .
however , i believe this ratio is redundant in the low inflation / low interest rate economy we now enjoy .
other factors are now much more relevant in assessing value .
the current proportion of average earnings required to pay the average mortgage is well below previous highs the irish experience provides a useful insight as to what is likely to happen in the uk .
ireland 's house price to earnings ratio fluctuated between similar levels to the uk until 1998 .
in the last four months of 1998 , irish interest rates halved from 6 % to 3 % prior to the euro launch on 1 january 1999 .
house prices continued to rise strongly and by 2000 the house price to earnings ratio had increased to six , sparking similar bearish comments on house prices to those now emanating from some commentators in the uk .
however , house prices kept increasing and the ratio is now nearly 8 , as the impact of their even lower interest rates has continued to improve affordability and hence property prices .
your comments it 's always the people involved with the property market who seem to have a bullish view , but they have the most to gain .
a elmas , japan / england i understand what ray is saying , but he is wrong , andrew is right , there is no such thing as " new " in economy , i believe that when this bubble bursts , it is going to be extremely nasty .
why do i think it will burst ? apart from the answer " its the economy , stupid " , basically even though monthly repayments are and will remain low , how can a first time buyer afford the deposit for such high prices ? and with first time buyers out of the market , it will have nowhere to go , the buy-to-lets will dump onto the market , and the spiral downwards will have begun !
as it is starting to in london -lrb- just read the comments made at the back of the next rics survey . very interesting reading ! -rrb-
christopher cook , surrey , uk i do n't agree with ray boulger .
how can house be so affordable when you have to borrow 5 or 6 times your salary ?
these pundits should remember two thirds of the working population are on less than average earnings !
also what about single people ?
if i borrowed the maximum on my salary , i would be paying about 45 % of my gross earnings in repayments .
it seems the country will be divided between property " haves " and property " have nots " if this market continues to rise .
richard , lancashire , uk a poll conducted by me amongst my friends suggests that those who currently own a house believe prices will stabilise and those who are hoping shortly to buy their first house believe prices will plummet .
tom disraeli , uk ray boulger is correct .
it all comes down to affordability , low inflation , low interest rates and unemployment , it would take a sharp rise in one or more of these to damper the current boom and who could argue that any of the above are waiting round the corner .
chris james , south africa one factor that rarely is mentioned in the likely influence of inherited property wealth coming to this generation .
given the uk 's ageing population and high property ownership levels this could be having a subtle yet strong influence on peoples buying habits .
mark , england i actually agree with both men -lrb- is this possible ? -rrb- .
ray boulger makes the point about low interest rates and affordability .
in the near term , while buying houses in affordable and lenders are offering long fixed rate mortgages , then people will be drawn into buying .
this will continue to sustain the housing boom until either people get complacent with the low interest rates , or something happens to the economy -lrb- historically this goes in cycles -rrb- .
if the interest rate starts to go up again , then people will be stuck , as the borrowing to income ratio is far too high .
so , as i see it , while interest rates continue to fall , people will have a false sense of security and continue to pay high prices for the next year or so .
if interest rates then go up , this will provide enough of a shock to the market which will see prices tumble .
the question is will the interest rate go up and if so , when ?
stefan gibney , uk and switzerland there will not be a crash in prices as we have moved into a new era of low interest rates and low inflation .
more and more people are stating to realise this and as such they are realising that they can afford to borrow more than they thought .
this in turn is helping maintain prices .
yes , there will probably be a slowing in growth this year and we may even see a few years of relatively flat growth -lrb- 3-5 % -rrb- .
however the key to the market is that interest payments remain manageable - this is the factor that the above economist does not recognise .
a.lee , sheffield , england i share andrew oswald 's view that the current housing boom is unsustainable .
one of the clear signs of an impending crash is unbridled optimism and opinions from experts justifying how and why the growth will be sustained .
one does not need to look beyond the internet bubble to see the ominous parallels .
suresh , england from the first time buyers perspective , there is a cost to not buying .
given that rent payments are essentially money down the drain , someone paying £ 600 per month rent can actually afford to buy and have their property value decline by up to £ 7k per year and still be better off .
so , for a first time buyer taking on a £ 100k property instead of paying £ 600pm rent , even the gloomy scenarios of 10 % -20 % declines over the next couple of years are actually not disastrous ... and of course things could improve and if first timers do n't act now they might find it even harder later .
rick , uk anybody can say that house prices will fall back and this stands to reason , but no one can actually say for certain when this will be .
many economists and experts have been predicting a crash for the last year but this has not happened yet , instead i understand that house prices have come down in london but risen in the rest of the country .
i would say that we are more likely to see a slowdown and that prices could remain static for some time though i would not like to speculate on when or how long this is likely to be ! !
steve , england i tend to agree with the professor .
each month the halifax and nationwide attempt to sustain an unsustainable market by producing misleading or selective statistics , simply because they are in denial , desperate to avoid the consequences of a meltdown .
that meltdown will occur , the only questions are when , and how severe it will be .
enough respected commentators -lrb- including the bank of england -rrb- continue to prepare us for the inevitable .
houses are only a commodity , and like the stock market subject to sentiment -lrb- where are the siren voices of 1999 tempting us with ever rising share values now ? -rrb- .
the " quick profit " mentality fuelled by popular tv programmes is already coming unstuck in the buy-to-let and speculative sectors , and the £ 1m plus london market is in steady decline .
only a fool -lrb- or someone with vested interests -rrb- continues chant the mantra " rising prices forever " denise mitchell , uk house prices will stay high simply because there is no other reasonably reliable investment .
people no longer trust the stock market , and are no longer paying as much in personal contributions into pension plans - what 's the point ?
partly as a result of this new short-termism , the banks must be awash with cash , so why on earth should interest rates rise ?
there is no cgt on one 's main property , whereas a pension is still taxed , eventually .
it all looks good for property as the only real short and long term investment .
in my opinion .
gil marais-gilchrist , england both professor andrew oswald and ray boulger offer plausible scenarios for the movement of future house prices .
for the individual buying a property in the current market , and i am one , the middle ground seems a sensible situation to hope for and expect .
i believe buying a house now will not give a return like those seen in recent years but equally buyers will not suffer huge losses like those of the early nineties .
paul , uk and usa as in any market scenario , there has to be a " catalyst " for change .
the 1989 housing market rise then crash was due to tax changes and subsequent rises in interest rates .
the catalyst for the 2000 stock market crash was an increase in interest rates .
there will have to be some factor which shakes people painfully out of the way they are thinking .
this would more than likely be an interest rake hike or a sharp increase in unemployment .
until the " catalyst " factor kicks in , prices will continue to rise .
colin larcombe , france i believe that neither of the above comments tell the whole story .
traditionally interest rates have been the key measure in the housing market , however the current upwards trend is i believe down to two things , firstly insecurity in the stock market leading to a shift to investing in property as opposed to shares , and secondly the changing mix of society - there are more single person buyers than in the past .
both of these factors lead to an increase in demand .
this is compounded by the supply of new properties being below the demand .
that is the key indicator , demand .
simple economics teaches us that when demand exceeds supply the price will rise .
i believe it is for this reason that the government recently announced initiatives to build large numbers of new houses , to stabilise the market .
andrew thomas , uk for the last year or so i 've seen the prices of even the smallest starter homes creep out of my price range .
as i have n't got a property to sell i 've felt the rise more harshly than those with a property that has risen in value as much as the home they 're buying .
so , if you 're a home owner already , the rise in house prices is not a big deal but it 's the first-time buyers , those who are being priced out of the market , who are going to force house prices down .
we simply ca n't buy houses and we wo n't buy houses in fear of a crash that will ruin us financially for life .
paul nattress , uk it does n't matter what the experts say , it boils down to what people are willing to pay .
when it comes to houses and people sense does not always prevail .
kenny , your experts rightly highlight affordability and sentiment as two key indicators in the housing market .
it seems to me that sentiment is the key criterion .
people will push the boat out if they feel bullish about the future .
combine a war in iraq with rising unemployment , and i think you will see a massive drop in sentiment .
30 % may be a little steep for a crash in 2003 - 2004 , but i would certainly think 10 % - 20 % is on the cards .
the only people talking up the housing market today are those involved in it - mortgage brokers , agents etc .
i suspect everyone else is terrified .
toby aldrich , uk people will continue to buy homes whilst the interest rates are low and affordable .
house prices will not drop until interest rates rise considerably and the cost of the monthly payments is beyond them .
si smith , uk i believe that the market will peak and then slowly and steadily decline .
the threat of war combined with manufacturing job losses will have a huge impact .
unemployment will rise in a number of industries and people will start spending more cautiously .
i think that as with the dot.com shares house prices are currently hugely over inflated and will inevitably have to drop as the people stop upgrading their accommodation .
nadina , uk both of your experts say things i understand but i find myself cherry picking from both scenarios to create the one which would suit me the best .
i have just sold my house in devon for 175 % of what i paid for it two years ago .
i do n't think that it will rise in value that quickly in the next two years but you never know ...
ian simmins , uk i do not feel that the market will crash as people will always need somewhere to live , however i am hoping that it does crash as a single person , trying to buy a house is impossible at the moment .
i earn a reasonable wage but mortgages are based on 2 wages .
i keep looking into this affordable housing that is being built but in hampshire a 1 bedroom affordable flat is £ 130k and i certainly can not get that mortgage on my own .
caroline hill , hamphire , uk what goes up , must come down and history does have a habit of repeating itself albeit never quite in the same way .
ray has certainly got one thing right , people do look at prices on the basis of what they can afford to pay each month rather than on the overall cost which , is fine if you are financing a new car over 3 years but foolish on a 25 year loan .
there are some interesting new factors to consider when prices start to soften this time round and the consequences are hard to guess .
in the last slump people were caught with negative equity , their loan being greater than the price they could sell for with the result that they either could not move or , if they did , had to carry with them an additional debt .
so the same thing will happen again except , this time , there wo n't be the benefit of inflation to reduce the real value of that debt over a short period .
the problem with low inflation is that the real value of any debt , is not eroded over time .
it is also probably true that existing home owners , rather than moving house , have taken equity out of their property via a remortgage , to spend on other things .
this type of deal has probably kept the high streets busy but , where that money has gone into buying a second property to rent out , there could be a lot of pain for the people concerned .
the rental market has already softened with landlords having to take " offers " on the rent which is no problem for those who bought such properties 10 years or so , ago .
for new landlords who have bought at inflated prices , the picture is not so good .
once prices start to fall , these people will feel the pain first which will probably lead to these properties coming onto the market to be sold , further depressing prices .
john , london , uk i think professor oswald is on the right path .
with so many first time buyers like myself being completely priced out of the housing market , house prices surely ca n't keep rising .
it is time people stopped using the average wage as a measure and instead used the wage of the average person .
nobody i know is on anywhere near the average wage -lrb- the figure is inaccurately high due to the ridiculous wage gap between high pay and average pay -rrb- .
as a result house prices in my area are actually around 8.5 times the average persons wage .
lee , birmingham , uk the hong kong example and the ireland example both cover times of extreme change for each respective country .
hong kong was going through the transition to chinese rule while ireland was being pumped full of eu money creating a " tiger " economy .
england is in a " normal " economic pattern where house prices long term are governed by multiples of earnings .
cost of borrowing will cause short / medium term highs and lows within this long term inflation based growth .
yes , the multiple may remain high , and may even go higher , but eventually the long term trend will prevail and force the multiple lower again .
aaron cowie , england i dont think that you can compare the housing market to the stock market as andrew has done .
we must remember that people actually want to buy houses to live in them , not just to make money .
i know many people in their twenties who would like to buy for the first time .
does this count for nothing ?
although i am following tom disrealis rule as i have just bought an inflated-price-house with my partner .
sarah philp , birmingham , uk i agree with the professor , prices are on the way down .
properties in richmond are becoming cheaper by the hour .
wake up the rest of the country because the ripple effect is happening big time in the traditionally expensive areas of london .
lisa , richmond , surrey the cheap credit available to property buyers is not only because of low boe rates , but also because banks and mortgage lenders regard this type of lending to be relatively risk free .
when more people start defaulting on their payments and losing their jobs , then the true risk of these loans will be revealed .
this will force lending rates / criteria up , even if boe rates continue to fall .
there is not only a bubble in house prices , but also one in bank lending to homeowners .
chris lucas , uk why does it matter , surely the prime requisite for some one bying a house should be as a roof over their head , not as an investment , this should be considered of secondary import .
if you buy as an investment , then like any investment , it is a gamble so do n't bleat if you lose ! .
as for the comment " ruined finacially for life " , do n't be so melodramtic , as long as you can keep up the mortgage payments you have a home , you may only loose money if you want to sell it , much like any other commodity .
chris , uk its not just the bottom rungs of the property ladder that are moving out of reach , all of the higher rungs are getting further apart .
as a home owner i would welcome some collapse in house prices because although our own house would be worth less , the amount of extra debt we would need to take on would be reduced .
getting the same house for less money seems like a good idea to me .
the only certain winners in this market are the banks .
guy roberts , uk at current interest rates , it 's just much cheaper for me to buy than to rent - even if i bought now , my mortgage would be only about 80 % of the cost of renting a similar property - with the advantage of course that i 'm investing in something i get to keep at the end of the day .
whilst this would change rapidly if interest rates changed , i think a -rrb- they 'd have to change quite a long way for it to tip that balance , and b -rrb- most buyers do n't think that long term. so i reckon prices will continue to rise for a while yet ... richard , uk no-one ever really mentions that britain is one of the few places where most people own their property .
on the continent renting is the norm for younger people .
although it is likely to worsen the rich-poor divide the huge amount of people with buy to let property may lead to a subtle shift away from owner occupation towards renting .
stuart , uk its important to see the big picture and look at the economy as a whole .
my particular point is employment .
although the office of national statistics claims unemployment is on the decrease , observations tell otherwise .
crucially , secure full-time jobs are decreasing , as are wages for the masses .
whilst a mean average wage may increase , there 's a strong bi-polar distribution .
the result is that fewer and fewer people have enough money to afford the exorbiant house prices , and hence demand falls , and prices plummet .
i would n't be at all surprised if andrew oswald 's prediction of a 30 % fall is optimistic - a 50 % decrease being more likley over the next 2-3 years .
jake gordon , england what this all really boils down to is public opinions .
as long as there is a continued increase in demand for housing , the laws of economics state that the prices will continue to rise .
all it would take to initiate a crash is for the balance of opinion to change and people to stop fuelling the demand .
people with a vested interest in keeping the market bouyant are propping it up with claims of sustained growth .
i would like to bet that rick , uk above , either works in the property trade or has just bought a house .
dan , uk property prices can only keep going up as occupancy rates drop .
with each new divorce , two homes are needed instead of one .
supply and demand dictate that as demand rises and supply does not , prices will rise .
tim johnston , southeast , england so we are told that " house prices rise as interest rates fall " is an immutable economic law that we can all rely on ?
so the three bed semi costing £ 250,000 at 4 % will increase to £ 500,000 at 2 % and £ 1 million at 1 % and . an infinite amount at 0 % because the interest repayments are zero ?
there surely comes a point when the absolute value for money in the property market is so poor in comparison with non property assets and the years of work and saving required to repay the capital , that the market is just not sustainable .
when that moment dawns on people , you really do n't want to be the person who just paid for someone else 's luxurious retirement to france -lrb- or anywhere with sensibly priced property -rrb- by buying their over priced house with a debt lasting 25 years .
if that semi reaches £ 1,000,000 - bonjour provence , au revoir south east england ! !
nigel curtress , surrey to all first time buyers , do n't do it , we fuel the market .
stop buying at ridiculous prices and realise when you are being ripped off .
sit back and wait for the fall and then select your bargain .
jan , uk another important consideration in house buying was - buy as high as you can afford , as your pay goes up your mortgage becomes more affordable .
hands up if you 've had a pay rise in the last couple of years .
no ?
i did n't think so .
ps national insurance contributions go up in april so you 'll have even less take-home pay .
darryl , uk it is obvious to me that house prices can not rise at a rate of 25 % indefinatly .
when the average pay rise is arround 4 % , it stands to reason that their has to be a slowdown at the very least .
paul , england i agree with the professor , and believe that apart from the inevitable movement upwards in interest rates at some point , affordability will also be severely hit by the forthcoming increase in national insurance contributions , increase upon increase in council taxes -lrb- both immediately and following the proposed re-banding of properties -rrb- , future tax increases necessary to meet the government 's spending plans and budget deficit , and consumers having to eventually pay their record level credit card bills .
kevin welch , england i agree with lisa 's comments from richmond .
london prices are falling , people are losing confidence in the market .
estate agents are not telling purchasers that the prices have been reduced .
however , they are often lapse in updating their websites and the discounts being offered are only too visbile .
the rest of the country will experience this in time and we will see a repeat of the last housing market crash .
during the last crash people kicked themselves for not seeing it coming .
the warning signs are there , proceed with caution .
rob , london it might be a an idea to look at the morals of the lenders and estate agents.after the fiasco of the early nineties of people losing all they had and some that are still paying for it.they -lrb- the lenders and estate agents -rrb- are the ones that are again driving the market instead of letting it cool down.rules should be put in place to tighten the reigns of house buyers and to explain the financial consequences of a bad fall in the housing market.a home is for living in and to hopefully bring up a family.how do we expect the younger generation to have children with such a large noose round their necks .
nobody knows the future including the two guys in this debate but we could all pull together for a solution to this question .
david , england as someone currently looking for a first house , i would love the market to drop substantially .
but there are many people in my position .
if prices start to drop , some of those people will then be able to afford what they could n't afford before .
they 'll start buying and that will push prices back up .
unless of course some other factor -lrb- mass unemployment , high interest rates -rrb- means that they still ca n't afford the lower prices .
perhaps if all first time buyers could unite & agree not to buy anything for the next 6 months , there would be a nice sharp drop ! !
but i suspect that wo n't happen .
emma , uk house prices have been stagnant in the part of hampshire where i live for the last five months and i 'm beginning to see reduced signs in estate agent 's windows .
one shop keeper i was talking to , has been trying to sell his house for the last four months with no takers .
i do n't think house prices will crash where i live but i do n't think they willl rise any more either , regardless of whether interest rates fall further or not ranj , uk recession is inevitable as the finance industry does n't accept a good year as being such .
people only have so much money , and when it 's gone and the credit card 's full and interest builds up , repayments can only come from monthly essentials like mortgages .
that 's the cycle of life - you have to ride the peaks , but the troughs are always there !
nick , uk most people agree with andrew but the reality agrees with ray .
how long must people wait for the crash ?
could this problem be averted by moving jobs to other parts of britain ?
it will increase demand in those areas but the overall demand will even out .
alternatively , build more flats -lrb- aiming at the increasing single population -rrb- .
remember the cartoon character who runs off the cliff and does n't realise it , their legs thrashing around for a few seconds before falling to earth .
that is todays situation but the seconds could be years .
jason , england i can not possibly see how the housing market can continue to increase .
i have been looking for a property as a first time buyer for sometime now and can see no light at the end of this miserable tunnel .
so what if the interest rates have been cut .
it still does not help me to get a mortgage .
as a single person and on a wage which is above the national average i still would not be able to get a suitable mortgage to afford to buy a property where i live .
not only that the repayments per month alone would be more than renting a property .
therefore what hope have first time buyers got .
surely without us to fuel the housing market how can there not be a decline in house prices ?
olivia , england who do you think has called the market correctly ?
are we heading for a crash or is growth going to continue ?

geoff gray , from seaham , said a cigarette lighter , cigarettes , aftershave , boxer shorts and a razor had gone missing following the death of his son , also called geoff .
the claim follows revelations that another deepcut soldier , private james collinson , had money taken from his bank account nine days after he died .
private collinson and private gray are two of four young soldiers whose mysterious deaths are being investigated by surrey police .
mr gray said : " geoff 's possessions were sent home in a big tea chest and we discovered that a whole load of stuff was missing .
" these might sound like insignificant things , but they were very important to him .
it really adds insult to injury . "
a spokesman for the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- apologised to the family for the distress caused .
he said : " i am aware there has been a problem returning personal effects to families of the soldiers that died at deepcut .
" the army is very sorry for distress caused by this and rather than theft , we think the problem stems from insufficient directions being given to those packaging up the belongings . "
police are also investigating the deaths of cheryl james , 18 , from llangollen , north wales , and sean benton , 20 , from hastings , east sussex .
