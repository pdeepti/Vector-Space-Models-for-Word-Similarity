critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .
right now they are 19.5 percent . while the commission will officially present its proposals on thursday , politicians , labor leaders and scientists have already begun to criticize one of the central reform suggestions , the raising of retirement age by two years , to 67 , by 2025 . “ in my estimation , raising the legal age of retirement is not going to help very much , ” franz müntefering , social democratic parliamentary group leader , told reporters .
the problem , he argued , is that most germans today retire at age 59 or 60 .
he wants germany to implement measures that would bring the actual retirement age of most closer to 65 . his conservative colleague and head of the bavaria-based christian social union , edmund stoiber , echoed the sentiment , saying it made no sense to talk about raising the retirement age “ when the average person goes into retirement at 60 anyway . ” abusing the system economists and labor leaders have been critical of the widespread practice of early retirement , saying many companies abuse it , using it as a way of transferring the costs of layoffs to the state . “ in 60 percent of companies we don ’ t have one employee over the age of 50 , ” said ursula engelen-kefer of the german trade union federation .
the head of the german institute of economic research , klaus zimmermann , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that ways had to be found to encourage companies to employee older workers longer . “ i can ’ t understand that we ’ re talking about a possible retirement age at 65 when industry considers people over 55 to be useless and wants to quickly put them out to pasture , ” christian wulff , premier of lower saxony , told ndr radio . unpopular reforms according to the newspaper die welt , the rürup commission report , which will officially be published on august 28 , calls for a reduction of pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent by 2030 .
citing government sources , die welt said the government wants to begin putting new measures into effect starting in the autumn .
in addition to upping the retirement age from 65 to 67 , a ban would be put into place on early retirements before the age of 64 .
the yearly cost-of-living increase will be reduced by 0.5 percent as part of a sustainability measure .
the commission is likely to recommend smaller annual increases or even a freeze in pension payments .

critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .
right now they are 19.5 percent . while the commission will officially present its proposals on thursday , politicians , labor leaders and scientists have already begun to criticize one of the central reform suggestions , the raising of retirement age by two years , to 67 , by 2025 . “ in my estimation , raising the legal age of retirement is not going to help very much , ” franz müntefering , social democratic parliamentary group leader , told reporters .
the problem , he argued , is that most germans today retire at age 59 or 60 .
he wants germany to implement measures that would bring the actual retirement age of most closer to 65 . his conservative colleague and head of the bavaria-based christian social union , edmund stoiber , echoed the sentiment , saying it made no sense to talk about raising the retirement age “ when the average person goes into retirement at 60 anyway . ” abusing the system economists and labor leaders have been critical of the widespread practice of early retirement , saying many companies abuse it , using it as a way of transferring the costs of layoffs to the state . “ in 60 percent of companies we don ’ t have one employee over the age of 50 , ” said ursula engelen-kefer of the german trade union federation .
the head of the german institute of economic research , klaus zimmermann , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that ways had to be found to encourage companies to employee older workers longer . “ i can ’ t understand that we ’ re talking about a possible retirement age at 65 when industry considers people over 55 to be useless and wants to quickly put them out to pasture , ” christian wulff , premier of lower saxony , told ndr radio . unpopular reforms according to the newspaper die welt , the rürup commission report , which will officially be published on august 28 , calls for a reduction of pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent by 2030 .
citing government sources , die welt said the government wants to begin putting new measures into effect starting in the autumn .
in addition to upping the retirement age from 65 to 67 , a ban would be put into place on early retirements before the age of 64 .
the yearly cost-of-living increase will be reduced by 0.5 percent as part of a sustainability measure .
the commission is likely to recommend smaller annual increases or even a freeze in pension payments .
german retirees currently see their payments raised in line with the average increase in gross wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ one year without an increase in pension payouts alone does not solve any of our pension problems , ” rürup -lrb- picture -rrb- told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , saying long-term and even difficult solutions had to be found to ensure the system remains solvent .
but the reforms are proving so unpopular , even before officially out of the bag , that it is unclear whether any of the commission ’ s suggestions will be put into place .
opposition politicians and labor unions have warned the current red-green coalition to keep its hands off current pension payments , saying that retirees had a right to a reliable income .
still , most germans do not seem to believe in the reliability of their retirement funds .
according to a recent poll , a solid majority believes that due to the ageing population , pensions payments will continue to sink in the long run , eventually reaching the level of welfare payments .

critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .
right now they are 19.5 percent . while the commission will officially present its proposals on thursday , politicians , labor leaders and scientists have already begun to criticize one of the central reform suggestions , the raising of retirement age by two years , to 67 , by 2025 . “ in my estimation , raising the legal age of retirement is not going to help very much , ” franz müntefering , social democratic parliamentary group leader , told reporters .
the problem , he argued , is that most germans today retire at age 59 or 60 .
he wants germany to implement measures that would bring the actual retirement age of most closer to 65 . his conservative colleague and head of the bavaria-based christian social union , edmund stoiber , echoed the sentiment , saying it made no sense to talk about raising the retirement age “ when the average person goes into retirement at 60 anyway . ” abusing the system economists and labor leaders have been critical of the widespread practice of early retirement , saying many companies abuse it , using it as a way of transferring the costs of layoffs to the state . “ in 60 percent of companies we don ’ t have one employee over the age of 50 , ” said ursula engelen-kefer of the german trade union federation .
the head of the german institute of economic research , klaus zimmermann , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that ways had to be found to encourage companies to employee older workers longer . “ i can ’ t understand that we ’ re talking about a possible retirement age at 65 when industry considers people over 55 to be useless and wants to quickly put them out to pasture , ” christian wulff , premier of lower saxony , told ndr radio . unpopular reforms according to the newspaper die welt , the rürup commission report , which will officially be published on august 28 , calls for a reduction of pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent by 2030 .
citing government sources , die welt said the government wants to begin putting new measures into effect starting in the autumn .
in addition to upping the retirement age from 65 to 67 , a ban would be put into place on early retirements before the age of 64 .
the yearly cost-of-living increase will be reduced by 0.5 percent as part of a sustainability measure .
the commission is likely to recommend smaller annual increases or even a freeze in pension payments .
german retirees currently see their payments raised in line with the average increase in gross wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ one year without an increase in pension payouts alone does not solve any of our pension problems , ” rürup -lrb- picture -rrb- told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , saying long-term and even difficult solutions had to be found to ensure the system remains solvent .
but the reforms are proving so unpopular , even before officially out of the bag , that it is unclear whether any of the commission ’ s suggestions will be put into place .
opposition politicians and labor unions have warned the current red-green coalition to keep its hands off current pension payments , saying that retirees had a right to a reliable income .
still , most germans do not seem to believe in the reliability of their retirement funds .
according to a recent poll , a solid majority believes that due to the ageing population , pensions payments will continue to sink in the long run , eventually reaching the level of welfare payments .
ulla schmidt , the minister of social affairs , said she will present the government ’ s package of comprehensive pension reform this fall . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reforming the social welfare state recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief .
opinion : the german social system in crisis now that the country 's social welfare system is bankrupt , germans from all walks of life need to learn to take responsibility for themselves .

critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .
right now they are 19.5 percent . while the commission will officially present its proposals on thursday , politicians , labor leaders and scientists have already begun to criticize one of the central reform suggestions , the raising of retirement age by two years , to 67 , by 2025 . “ in my estimation , raising the legal age of retirement is not going to help very much , ” franz müntefering , social democratic parliamentary group leader , told reporters .
the problem , he argued , is that most germans today retire at age 59 or 60 .
he wants germany to implement measures that would bring the actual retirement age of most closer to 65 . his conservative colleague and head of the bavaria-based christian social union , edmund stoiber , echoed the sentiment , saying it made no sense to talk about raising the retirement age “ when the average person goes into retirement at 60 anyway . ” abusing the system economists and labor leaders have been critical of the widespread practice of early retirement , saying many companies abuse it , using it as a way of transferring the costs of layoffs to the state . “ in 60 percent of companies we don ’ t have one employee over the age of 50 , ” said ursula engelen-kefer of the german trade union federation .
the head of the german institute of economic research , klaus zimmermann , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that ways had to be found to encourage companies to employee older workers longer . “ i can ’ t understand that we ’ re talking about a possible retirement age at 65 when industry considers people over 55 to be useless and wants to quickly put them out to pasture , ” christian wulff , premier of lower saxony , told ndr radio . unpopular reforms according to the newspaper die welt , the rürup commission report , which will officially be published on august 28 , calls for a reduction of pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent by 2030 .
citing government sources , die welt said the government wants to begin putting new measures into effect starting in the autumn .
in addition to upping the retirement age from 65 to 67 , a ban would be put into place on early retirements before the age of 64 .
the yearly cost-of-living increase will be reduced by 0.5 percent as part of a sustainability measure .
the commission is likely to recommend smaller annual increases or even a freeze in pension payments .
german retirees currently see their payments raised in line with the average increase in gross wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ one year without an increase in pension payouts alone does not solve any of our pension problems , ” rürup -lrb- picture -rrb- told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , saying long-term and even difficult solutions had to be found to ensure the system remains solvent .
but the reforms are proving so unpopular , even before officially out of the bag , that it is unclear whether any of the commission ’ s suggestions will be put into place .
opposition politicians and labor unions have warned the current red-green coalition to keep its hands off current pension payments , saying that retirees had a right to a reliable income .
still , most germans do not seem to believe in the reliability of their retirement funds .
according to a recent poll , a solid majority believes that due to the ageing population , pensions payments will continue to sink in the long run , eventually reaching the level of welfare payments .

critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .
right now they are 19.5 percent . while the commission will officially present its proposals on thursday , politicians , labor leaders and scientists have already begun to criticize one of the central reform suggestions , the raising of retirement age by two years , to 67 , by 2025 . “ in my estimation , raising the legal age of retirement is not going to help very much , ” franz müntefering , social democratic parliamentary group leader , told reporters .

the german government has warned the 14 tourists released from kidnappers in the sahara desert against profiting from their experiences there , saying they should give any money earned from their story back to the state . it can be lucrative to endure a harrowing ordeal , be it kidnapping , a natural disaster or an unusual accident — if one survives , that is .
often the former victim is in high demand by the media and can profit handsomely from television appearances , a compelling book or even movie rights . but the german government has warned the european tourists freed last week after almost six months in captivity in the sahara desert against just that , saying they should forward any money made off the experience to the public coffers , to reimburse the state for the expense of freeing them . " the costs are enormous . " defense minister peter struck told the welt am sonntag newspaper that troops from the german military , the bundeswehr , had been involved with the hostage situation since easter , first in algeria , then in mali . “ the costs are enormous .
with consideration for the taxpayer , we should expect that people don ’ t make a profit from their kidnapping but make fees for photos and stories available to the state , ” he told the paper . while the government is not making figures available , media reports say germany paid a ransom between $ 4.6 million and $ 16.5 million to secure the hostages release from the salafist group for preaching and combat , a group of islamic extremists which has claimed responsibility for the kidnappings . the newsmagazine der spiegel has reported that international arrest warrants are being prepared for members of the group , particularly for amari saifi , a leading figure also known as abderazzak el para .

critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .
right now they are 19.5 percent . while the commission will officially present its proposals on thursday , politicians , labor leaders and scientists have already begun to criticize one of the central reform suggestions , the raising of retirement age by two years , to 67 , by 2025 . “ in my estimation , raising the legal age of retirement is not going to help very much , ” franz müntefering , social democratic parliamentary group leader , told reporters .
the problem , he argued , is that most germans today retire at age 59 or 60 .
he wants germany to implement measures that would bring the actual retirement age of most closer to 65 . his conservative colleague and head of the bavaria-based christian social union , edmund stoiber , echoed the sentiment , saying it made no sense to talk about raising the retirement age “ when the average person goes into retirement at 60 anyway . ” abusing the system economists and labor leaders have been critical of the widespread practice of early retirement , saying many companies abuse it , using it as a way of transferring the costs of layoffs to the state . “ in 60 percent of companies we don ’ t have one employee over the age of 50 , ” said ursula engelen-kefer of the german trade union federation .
the head of the german institute of economic research , klaus zimmermann , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that ways had to be found to encourage companies to employee older workers longer . “ i can ’ t understand that we ’ re talking about a possible retirement age at 65 when industry considers people over 55 to be useless and wants to quickly put them out to pasture , ” christian wulff , premier of lower saxony , told ndr radio . unpopular reforms according to the newspaper die welt , the rürup commission report , which will officially be published on august 28 , calls for a reduction of pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent by 2030 .
citing government sources , die welt said the government wants to begin putting new measures into effect starting in the autumn .
in addition to upping the retirement age from 65 to 67 , a ban would be put into place on early retirements before the age of 64 .
the yearly cost-of-living increase will be reduced by 0.5 percent as part of a sustainability measure .
the commission is likely to recommend smaller annual increases or even a freeze in pension payments .
german retirees currently see their payments raised in line with the average increase in gross wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ one year without an increase in pension payouts alone does not solve any of our pension problems , ” rürup -lrb- picture -rrb- told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , saying long-term and even difficult solutions had to be found to ensure the system remains solvent .
but the reforms are proving so unpopular , even before officially out of the bag , that it is unclear whether any of the commission ’ s suggestions will be put into place .
opposition politicians and labor unions have warned the current red-green coalition to keep its hands off current pension payments , saying that retirees had a right to a reliable income .
still , most germans do not seem to believe in the reliability of their retirement funds .
according to a recent poll , a solid majority believes that due to the ageing population , pensions payments will continue to sink in the long run , eventually reaching the level of welfare payments .

critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .

the german government has warned the 14 tourists released from kidnappers in the sahara desert against profiting from their experiences there , saying they should give any money earned from their story back to the state . it can be lucrative to endure a harrowing ordeal , be it kidnapping , a natural disaster or an unusual accident — if one survives , that is .
often the former victim is in high demand by the media and can profit handsomely from television appearances , a compelling book or even movie rights . but the german government has warned the european tourists freed last week after almost six months in captivity in the sahara desert against just that , saying they should forward any money made off the experience to the public coffers , to reimburse the state for the expense of freeing them . " the costs are enormous . " defense minister peter struck told the welt am sonntag newspaper that troops from the german military , the bundeswehr , had been involved with the hostage situation since easter , first in algeria , then in mali . “ the costs are enormous .
with consideration for the taxpayer , we should expect that people don ’ t make a profit from their kidnapping but make fees for photos and stories available to the state , ” he told the paper . while the government is not making figures available , media reports say germany paid a ransom between $ 4.6 million and $ 16.5 million to secure the hostages release from the salafist group for preaching and combat , a group of islamic extremists which has claimed responsibility for the kidnappings . the newsmagazine der spiegel has reported that international arrest warrants are being prepared for members of the group , particularly for amari saifi , a leading figure also known as abderazzak el para .
however , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ’ office , hartmut schneider , would not confirm the report . a 14 europeans , nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , had been held since february in algeria and then in neighboring mali .
the flew back to germany from mali ’ s capital , bamako , on wednesday . covering the costs the high expense of the months-long attempt to free the tourists has led some politicians to demand that the hostages themselves be required to reimburse the state , at least in part . “ those who frivolously put themselves in danger just for the thrill of it must accept the fact that they have to help cover the costs of any rescue operation , ” wolfgang bosback of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the financial times last week . before the february kidnapping in algeria , germany ’ s foreign office had release a security alert for the country , one step down from a full travel warning .
the alert warned potential tourists to the region that travelling in and through the sahara should only be undertaken with experienced travel companies or after thorough preparation . germany ’ s “ sahara club ” called the accusations of frivolousness “ completely absurd , ” saying tourists who choose that destination are adventurers , but hardly frivolous .
“ the desert is a completely normal vacation destination , even for families and children , ” the group ’ s head , gunter frenzel , told reporters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians demand hostages pay up the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release .
sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .
right now they are 19.5 percent . while the commission will officially present its proposals on thursday , politicians , labor leaders and scientists have already begun to criticize one of the central reform suggestions , the raising of retirement age by two years , to 67 , by 2025 . “ in my estimation , raising the legal age of retirement is not going to help very much , ” franz müntefering , social democratic parliamentary group leader , told reporters .
the problem , he argued , is that most germans today retire at age 59 or 60 .
he wants germany to implement measures that would bring the actual retirement age of most closer to 65 . his conservative colleague and head of the bavaria-based christian social union , edmund stoiber , echoed the sentiment , saying it made no sense to talk about raising the retirement age “ when the average person goes into retirement at 60 anyway . ” abusing the system economists and labor leaders have been critical of the widespread practice of early retirement , saying many companies abuse it , using it as a way of transferring the costs of layoffs to the state . “ in 60 percent of companies we don ’ t have one employee over the age of 50 , ” said ursula engelen-kefer of the german trade union federation .
the head of the german institute of economic research , klaus zimmermann , told the welt am sonntag newspaper that ways had to be found to encourage companies to employee older workers longer . “ i can ’ t understand that we ’ re talking about a possible retirement age at 65 when industry considers people over 55 to be useless and wants to quickly put them out to pasture , ” christian wulff , premier of lower saxony , told ndr radio . unpopular reforms according to the newspaper die welt , the rürup commission report , which will officially be published on august 28 , calls for a reduction of pension levels from 48 percent to 40.1 percent by 2030 .
citing government sources , die welt said the government wants to begin putting new measures into effect starting in the autumn .
in addition to upping the retirement age from 65 to 67 , a ban would be put into place on early retirements before the age of 64 .
the yearly cost-of-living increase will be reduced by 0.5 percent as part of a sustainability measure .
the commission is likely to recommend smaller annual increases or even a freeze in pension payments .
german retirees currently see their payments raised in line with the average increase in gross wages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ one year without an increase in pension payouts alone does not solve any of our pension problems , ” rürup -lrb- picture -rrb- told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung , saying long-term and even difficult solutions had to be found to ensure the system remains solvent .
but the reforms are proving so unpopular , even before officially out of the bag , that it is unclear whether any of the commission ’ s suggestions will be put into place .

critics blast pension reform ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , germans might have fewer years to enjoy retirement .
the commission exploring ways to save germany ’ s failing pension system has suggested raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 .
politicians from across the spectrum have expressed outrage at the idea . the german government has no choice but to make radical changes to its state-funded pensions if the system is to survive .
bert rürup , who heads the commission that bears his name , has been charged with figuring out how to save a system which is burdened to the point of collapse largely due to the country ’ s ageing population . today , 2.3 persons work to support one retiree in germany .
but by 2030 , according to reliable demographic estimates , that ratio could be more than halved .
the rürup commission warns that , without reform , pension contributions would have to rise to between 24 % and 25 % of gross wages by 2030 .
right now they are 19.5 percent . while the commission will officially present its proposals on thursday , politicians , labor leaders and scientists have already begun to criticize one of the central reform suggestions , the raising of retirement age by two years , to 67 , by 2025 . “ in my estimation , raising the legal age of retirement is not going to help very much , ” franz müntefering , social democratic parliamentary group leader , told reporters .
the problem , he argued , is that most germans today retire at age 59 or 60 .
he wants germany to implement measures that would bring the actual retirement age of most closer to 65 . his conservative colleague and head of the bavaria-based christian social union , edmund stoiber , echoed the sentiment , saying it made no sense to talk about raising the retirement age “ when the average person goes into retirement at 60 anyway . ” abusing the system economists and labor leaders have been critical of the widespread practice of early retirement , saying many companies abuse it , using it as a way of transferring the costs of layoffs to the state . “ in 60 percent of companies we don ’ t have one employee over the age of 50 , ” said ursula engelen-kefer of the german trade union federation .

the german government has warned the 14 tourists released from kidnappers in the sahara desert against profiting from their experiences there , saying they should give any money earned from their story back to the state . it can be lucrative to endure a harrowing ordeal , be it kidnapping , a natural disaster or an unusual accident — if one survives , that is .
often the former victim is in high demand by the media and can profit handsomely from television appearances , a compelling book or even movie rights . but the german government has warned the european tourists freed last week after almost six months in captivity in the sahara desert against just that , saying they should forward any money made off the experience to the public coffers , to reimburse the state for the expense of freeing them . " the costs are enormous . " defense minister peter struck told the welt am sonntag newspaper that troops from the german military , the bundeswehr , had been involved with the hostage situation since easter , first in algeria , then in mali . “ the costs are enormous .
with consideration for the taxpayer , we should expect that people don ’ t make a profit from their kidnapping but make fees for photos and stories available to the state , ” he told the paper . while the government is not making figures available , media reports say germany paid a ransom between $ 4.6 million and $ 16.5 million to secure the hostages release from the salafist group for preaching and combat , a group of islamic extremists which has claimed responsibility for the kidnappings . the newsmagazine der spiegel has reported that international arrest warrants are being prepared for members of the group , particularly for amari saifi , a leading figure also known as abderazzak el para .
however , a spokesman for the german prosecutors ’ office , hartmut schneider , would not confirm the report . a 14 europeans , nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , had been held since february in algeria and then in neighboring mali .
the flew back to germany from mali ’ s capital , bamako , on wednesday . covering the costs the high expense of the months-long attempt to free the tourists has led some politicians to demand that the hostages themselves be required to reimburse the state , at least in part . “ those who frivolously put themselves in danger just for the thrill of it must accept the fact that they have to help cover the costs of any rescue operation , ” wolfgang bosback of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the financial times last week . before the february kidnapping in algeria , germany ’ s foreign office had release a security alert for the country , one step down from a full travel warning .
the alert warned potential tourists to the region that travelling in and through the sahara should only be undertaken with experienced travel companies or after thorough preparation . germany ’ s “ sahara club ” called the accusations of frivolousness “ completely absurd , ” saying tourists who choose that destination are adventurers , but hardly frivolous .
“ the desert is a completely normal vacation destination , even for families and children , ” the group ’ s head , gunter frenzel , told reporters . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians demand hostages pay up the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release .
sahara hostages freed fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .

paul bremer was speaking in the city as brazil paid its last respects to un envoy sergio vieira de mello , killed along with at least 22 others .
he said that while there was little evidence of who had carried out the attack , about 100 foreign militants had recently infiltrated iraq .
unknown militants ambushed uk troops in basra on saturday , killing three , while ethnic clashes in kirkuk have left nine people dead . "
you have to be willing to go on the offensive against terrorism - kill them before they kill you " paul bremer mr bremer , who wept over the coffin of mr vieira de mello before it left baghdad on friday , said the un bomb was of a size not seen before in post-war iraq .
" it is now unfortunately the case that iraq has become one of the fields of battle in this global war , " he told reporters .
he said there were two kinds of " foreign terrorists " now entering iraq : those who travelled from places like syria , the sudan or yemen , and those who were part of the militant group ansar al-islam , which has been linked with al-qaeda .
" you have to be willing to go on the offensive against terrorism - kill them before they kill you , " the us administrator said .
un returns us president george w bush pledged on saturday to " continue this war on terror until all the killers are brought to justice " .
in kirkuk in the north , ethnic kurds and turkmen tribesmen fought lethal battles with guns and grenades after a dispute which erupted on friday night , apparently over a newly reopened turkmen shrine .
the ambush in the southern city of basra brought uk combat losses since the official end of major combat on 1 may to 10 .
us losses for the same period exceed 60 .
in the iraqi capital , it has emerged that the british embassy has been evacuated because of the threat of an attack .
un staff have been resuming work in the city out of tents and shipping containers , set up next to the ruins of their headquarters in the canal hotel .
jan egeland , the new un under secretary general for humanitarian affairs , said there would be fewer staff , they would travel less and they would be hampered by strict security procedures .
mr bremer said security was under review and he believed that the bombing had galvanised the will of the world to help .
the us administrator also said he shared the frustration of iraq 's governing council at the failure to restore essential services to pre-war levels .
bomb claim in the absence of hard information about those behind tuesday 's apparent suicide attack , a man purporting to represent an iraqi islamic militant group called mohammed 's army has claimed responsibility .
an unidentified masked man appeared on lebanese satellite tv on saturday to say the group had attacked the offices because us intelligence officers were present there .
a dubai-based tv channel , al-arabiya , earlier carried a similar claim from the previously unknown group .

the jailing of right-wing australian politician pauline hanson for electoral fraud is said to have strengthened her popularity among queensland voters .
a poll of 300 people by queensland newspaper the sunday mail showed 21 % would vote for her anti-immigration one nation party , almost as high as her 23 % peak in popularity in 1998 .
senior members of the state 's labour party is worried that the public backlash from hanson 's three-year prison sentence could cost them the state government .
australian prime minister john howard added his concerns about the severity of the jail-term after a brisbane jury found hanson and her one nation party co-founder david ettridge guilty of illegally registering their party in queensland .
the pair faced charges of illegally using the names of 500 members of a support group to register one nation as a political party , as well as fraudulently obtaining almost a $ 500,000 -lrb- us $ 325,000 -rrb- in electoral funds .
ramifications the sunday mail poll found that more than 82 % thought the jail sentence was too long and 65 % said 49-year-old hanson should not have been jailed at all .
queensland 's labour party premier , peter beattie , told australian television channel 10 on sunday his office had been flooded with e-mails , faxes , calls and letters criticising the sentence .
she appealed across party lines to working class , white males , who saw in this former fish-and-chip-shop owner somebody who was like themselves profile of pauline hanson " there 's no doubt that this will martyr pauline hanson , " he said .
" it will put my government at risk .
it will also have ramifications for the conservative side of politics . "
hanson , a former chip shop owner , shot to national and international attention in the late 1990s with her extreme views on immigration , australia 's indigenous people and asylum seekers .
hanson 's official website has compared her jail term to that of nelson mandela in apartheid-era south africa , and a " fighting fund " has been launched to seek donations to help finance an appeal .
her lawyers lodged a 12-point appeal with the brisbane supreme court of appeal , citing " interference by political identities of power " .
mr howard dismissed claims from mrs hanson 's supporters that she was victimised by mainstream political parties , who object to her extreme right-wing policies .
