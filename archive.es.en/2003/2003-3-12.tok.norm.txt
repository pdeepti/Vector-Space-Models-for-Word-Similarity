one notable absentee from the list is the united states , which says it fears the court could be abused for politically motivated prosecutions .
other opponents include israel , china and iraq . washington 's worries although the united states under president bill clinton signed the 1998 rome statute setting out the icc 's jurisdiction , structure and functions , the bush administration has since backed away from the agreement .

furthermore , it will only have the authority to try cases where either the suspect comes from a state that has ratified the court , or the crime was committed in such a state , unless the u.n. security council refers a case to it .
200 cases pending since its official establishment , the court has received more than 200 complaints alleging war crimes .
no legal action can be taken until a chief prosecutor is appointed , a move expected to take place in april .
human rights organizations have hailed the inauguration of the court as the biggest step forward for world justice since the nuremberg tribunals .

kaul , born in 1943 , has served in consulates in norway , israel , and the united states , as well the german mission to the united nations .
he was also head of germany 's office for public international law , and has been involved in moves to set up the icc since 1996 .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .

one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .
both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race . " kirchmedia a lucrative draw kirchmedia , the most lucrative leftover of the insolvent kirch group , not only owns germany 's most extensive film rights library with a catalogue of some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 televison series , but also has majority stake in the country 's largest free-to-air television network , prosiebensat1 . apparently it was the hefty price of the television operations which exceeded bauer 's willingness to pay . -lrb- however , some experts believed bauer 's stake in the rtl 2 channel could also have caused problems with germany 's monopolies commission . -rrb- kirchmedia was regarded as the jewel in the crown of bavarian entrepreneur leo kirch 's business empire .
the kirch group collapsed under a € 6.5 billion debt in april 2002 .
disagreements between kirchmedia and its advisers and creditors have hampered attempts to find a buyer for the company .
saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .
there he provided soundtracks for cartoon films and television series , finally hitting the big time with the japanese cartoon series " power rangers . " he recently sold his interests in fox family worldwide tv for $ 1.5 billion , which gave him the resources to try to break into german television .
critics , however , say the self-made tycoon left fox with a mountain of debt and point to the fact that the saban capital group , which he founded over a year ago , has no experience in investing in media companies . if saban 's bid goes through , he will become one of germany 's most important media managers almost overnight .
the board of creditors , a collection of banks and hollywood film studios owed money by kirchmedia , have given ceo ziems until sunday to finalize negotiations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .
" curry sausage ca n't be turned into filet mignon overnight , " kauder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cities issue a plea for money confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help .

one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .
both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .
kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .

it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .

industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .

werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .
dispute slows reform effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica djindjic 's feud with kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- since the two jointly toppled milosevic has virtually paralyzed the country 's much-needed economic and social reforms .
djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .
though derided for his fondness for big cars and flashy suits , djindjic 's trade of milosevic for $ 1.2 billion in international economic aid appeared to have won respect from people desperate to improve a living standard that ranks among the lowest in europe .
role in kosovo urged he also helped preside over the end of yugoslavia and the creation of the country of serbia-montenegro last month .
also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .
a nato-led peacekeeping force of 30,000 troops is stationed in kosovo , which remains part of yugoslavia .
a fitness enthusiast , djindjic was born in bosanski samac , in bosnia , the son of a yugoslav people 's army officer .
djindjic , who spoke german and english , was married with two children . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia 's choice : nationalism or the path to brussels ?

one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .
both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race . " kirchmedia a lucrative draw kirchmedia , the most lucrative leftover of the insolvent kirch group , not only owns germany 's most extensive film rights library with a catalogue of some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 televison series , but also has majority stake in the country 's largest free-to-air television network , prosiebensat1 . apparently it was the hefty price of the television operations which exceeded bauer 's willingness to pay . -lrb- however , some experts believed bauer 's stake in the rtl 2 channel could also have caused problems with germany 's monopolies commission . -rrb- kirchmedia was regarded as the jewel in the crown of bavarian entrepreneur leo kirch 's business empire .
the kirch group collapsed under a € 6.5 billion debt in april 2002 .
disagreements between kirchmedia and its advisers and creditors have hampered attempts to find a buyer for the company .
saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .
there he provided soundtracks for cartoon films and television series , finally hitting the big time with the japanese cartoon series " power rangers . " he recently sold his interests in fox family worldwide tv for $ 1.5 billion , which gave him the resources to try to break into german television .
critics , however , say the self-made tycoon left fox with a mountain of debt and point to the fact that the saban capital group , which he founded over a year ago , has no experience in investing in media companies . if saban 's bid goes through , he will become one of germany 's most important media managers almost overnight .
the board of creditors , a collection of banks and hollywood film studios owed money by kirchmedia , have given ceo ziems until sunday to finalize negotiations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .

"
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .
dispute slows reform effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica djindjic 's feud with kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- since the two jointly toppled milosevic has virtually paralyzed the country 's much-needed economic and social reforms .
djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .
though derided for his fondness for big cars and flashy suits , djindjic 's trade of milosevic for $ 1.2 billion in international economic aid appeared to have won respect from people desperate to improve a living standard that ranks among the lowest in europe .
role in kosovo urged he also helped preside over the end of yugoslavia and the creation of the country of serbia-montenegro last month .
also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .
dispute slows reform effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica djindjic 's feud with kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- since the two jointly toppled milosevic has virtually paralyzed the country 's much-needed economic and social reforms .
djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .
though derided for his fondness for big cars and flashy suits , djindjic 's trade of milosevic for $ 1.2 billion in international economic aid appeared to have won respect from people desperate to improve a living standard that ranks among the lowest in europe .
role in kosovo urged he also helped preside over the end of yugoslavia and the creation of the country of serbia-montenegro last month .
also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .

but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world . the international criminal court , the world 's first independent , permanent and global war crimes tribunal , held its inaugural session on tuesday with the swearing-in of 18 judges . the court is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
the icc has been ratified by 89 countries , including all european union member states , as well as such war-torn nations as afghanistan , east timor and the democratic republic of congo .
one notable absentee from the list is the united states , which says it fears the court could be abused for politically motivated prosecutions .
other opponents include israel , china and iraq . washington 's worries although the united states under president bill clinton signed the 1998 rome statute setting out the icc 's jurisdiction , structure and functions , the bush administration has since backed away from the agreement .
washington says anti-american prosecutors could bring charges against u.s. troops or officials , both past and present .
the united states has been lobbying other nations to sign bilateral agreements under which neither party would bring the other ’ s citizens before the court .
washington 's stance has drawn criticism both at home and abroad .
benjamin ferencz , who served as a war crimes prosecutor for the u.s. at the nuremberg tribunals , said on his web site , " the current leadership in the united states seems to have forgotten the lessons we tried to teach the rest of the world . "
nevertheless , some human rights campaigners say the inauguration of the first 18 judges will make it more difficult for washington to undermine the court .
richard dicker of the human rights organization human rights watch told the news agency reuters , " the judges ' inauguration makes this court more unstoppable than ever . " genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes the icc will hear trials relating to genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and the " crime of aggression , " which has yet to be formally defined .
it will be authorized to deal only with crimes committed after july 2002 , when it officially came into being , and only in cases where the state in which the alleged crime was committed is unwilling or unable to hold its own trial .
furthermore , it will only have the authority to try cases where either the suspect comes from a state that has ratified the court , or the crime was committed in such a state , unless the u.n. security council refers a case to it .
200 cases pending since its official establishment , the court has received more than 200 complaints alleging war crimes .
no legal action can be taken until a chief prosecutor is appointed , a move expected to take place in april .
human rights organizations have hailed the inauguration of the court as the biggest step forward for world justice since the nuremberg tribunals .
u.n. secretary-general kofi annan was among hundreds of dignitaries invited to the opening ceremony . german among first judges appointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter kaul is the first german judge to be elected to the bench at the icc .
the court 's first 18 judges , 11 men and seven women , include the german career diplomat and lawyer hans-peter kaul -lrb- photo -rrb- .
kaul , born in 1943 , has served in consulates in norway , israel , and the united states , as well the german mission to the united nations .
he was also head of germany 's office for public international law , and has been involved in moves to set up the icc since 1996 .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .
" two years ago , our main concern was a lack of qualified workers .
today , it ’ s a lack of financing .
what we 're experiencing is a reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , and a lack of venture capital .
it 's getting more and more difficult to raise funds for start-ups and early-stage investment , " he said .
jung added that those it firms who have survived despite difficult conditions deserved to be given a better chance .
3g phones provide a ray of hope while industry leaders say they do n't expect a major upturn until 2004 , they 're placing high hopes in the telecommunications market , led by w-lan -lrb- wireless local area network -rrb- technology for the internet and the third generation mobile telephone technology , 3g , known in germany as umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- . despite repeated delays in the launch of 3g technology in germany and the enormous price providers paid for their licenses -lrb- in the summer of 2000 , the german government auctioned the licenses to the six highest bidders , bringing in the equivalent of almost € 50 billion , or $ 50.3 bn . -rrb- , the industry expects 3g to be a major success in the medium term .
jung said , " we expect these innovations to open up genuine mass markets from 2005 onwards . " guest speaker jorma ollila of nokia echoed those hopes , saying , " mobility , in my view , is the next global megatrend .
the coming years will show its impact in shaping all areas of information technology , media and consumer industries alike .
everyone is a potential mobile consumer , and we all are becoming part of a truly mobile world . "
but first , it companies have to make it through 2003 .
jung said he would be happy if he could count on positive growth at all , even if it 's less than one percent .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .
" two years ago , our main concern was a lack of qualified workers .
today , it ’ s a lack of financing .
what we 're experiencing is a reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , and a lack of venture capital .
it 's getting more and more difficult to raise funds for start-ups and early-stage investment , " he said .
jung added that those it firms who have survived despite difficult conditions deserved to be given a better chance .
3g phones provide a ray of hope while industry leaders say they do n't expect a major upturn until 2004 , they 're placing high hopes in the telecommunications market , led by w-lan -lrb- wireless local area network -rrb- technology for the internet and the third generation mobile telephone technology , 3g , known in germany as umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- . despite repeated delays in the launch of 3g technology in germany and the enormous price providers paid for their licenses -lrb- in the summer of 2000 , the german government auctioned the licenses to the six highest bidders , bringing in the equivalent of almost € 50 billion , or $ 50.3 bn . -rrb- , the industry expects 3g to be a major success in the medium term .
jung said , " we expect these innovations to open up genuine mass markets from 2005 onwards . " guest speaker jorma ollila of nokia echoed those hopes , saying , " mobility , in my view , is the next global megatrend .
the coming years will show its impact in shaping all areas of information technology , media and consumer industries alike .
everyone is a potential mobile consumer , and we all are becoming part of a truly mobile world . "
but first , it companies have to make it through 2003 .
jung said he would be happy if he could count on positive growth at all , even if it 's less than one percent .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .
kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .

one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .
both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race . " kirchmedia a lucrative draw kirchmedia , the most lucrative leftover of the insolvent kirch group , not only owns germany 's most extensive film rights library with a catalogue of some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 televison series , but also has majority stake in the country 's largest free-to-air television network , prosiebensat1 . apparently it was the hefty price of the television operations which exceeded bauer 's willingness to pay . -lrb- however , some experts believed bauer 's stake in the rtl 2 channel could also have caused problems with germany 's monopolies commission . -rrb- kirchmedia was regarded as the jewel in the crown of bavarian entrepreneur leo kirch 's business empire .
the kirch group collapsed under a € 6.5 billion debt in april 2002 .
disagreements between kirchmedia and its advisers and creditors have hampered attempts to find a buyer for the company .
saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .
there he provided soundtracks for cartoon films and television series , finally hitting the big time with the japanese cartoon series " power rangers . " he recently sold his interests in fox family worldwide tv for $ 1.5 billion , which gave him the resources to try to break into german television .
critics , however , say the self-made tycoon left fox with a mountain of debt and point to the fact that the saban capital group , which he founded over a year ago , has no experience in investing in media companies . if saban 's bid goes through , he will become one of germany 's most important media managers almost overnight .
the board of creditors , a collection of banks and hollywood film studios owed money by kirchmedia , have given ceo ziems until sunday to finalize negotiations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race . " kirchmedia a lucrative draw kirchmedia , the most lucrative leftover of the insolvent kirch group , not only owns germany 's most extensive film rights library with a catalogue of some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 televison series , but also has majority stake in the country 's largest free-to-air television network , prosiebensat1 . apparently it was the hefty price of the television operations which exceeded bauer 's willingness to pay . -lrb- however , some experts believed bauer 's stake in the rtl 2 channel could also have caused problems with germany 's monopolies commission . -rrb- kirchmedia was regarded as the jewel in the crown of bavarian entrepreneur leo kirch 's business empire .
the kirch group collapsed under a € 6.5 billion debt in april 2002 .
disagreements between kirchmedia and its advisers and creditors have hampered attempts to find a buyer for the company .
saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .
there he provided soundtracks for cartoon films and television series , finally hitting the big time with the japanese cartoon series " power rangers . " he recently sold his interests in fox family worldwide tv for $ 1.5 billion , which gave him the resources to try to break into german television .
critics , however , say the self-made tycoon left fox with a mountain of debt and point to the fact that the saban capital group , which he founded over a year ago , has no experience in investing in media companies . if saban 's bid goes through , he will become one of germany 's most important media managers almost overnight .
the board of creditors , a collection of banks and hollywood film studios owed money by kirchmedia , have given ceo ziems until sunday to finalize negotiations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.03.2003 schröder will focus on unemployment , aid to cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the job : chancellor gerhard schröder is planning to offer aid to the country 's battered builders .
german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .
" curry sausage ca n't be turned into filet mignon overnight , " kauder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cities issue a plea for money confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .
kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2003 u.s. billionare set to take over bankrupt german media group großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirchmedia 's film rights library in munich contains some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 television series .
one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .
both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race . " kirchmedia a lucrative draw kirchmedia , the most lucrative leftover of the insolvent kirch group , not only owns germany 's most extensive film rights library with a catalogue of some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 televison series , but also has majority stake in the country 's largest free-to-air television network , prosiebensat1 . apparently it was the hefty price of the television operations which exceeded bauer 's willingness to pay . -lrb- however , some experts believed bauer 's stake in the rtl 2 channel could also have caused problems with germany 's monopolies commission . -rrb- kirchmedia was regarded as the jewel in the crown of bavarian entrepreneur leo kirch 's business empire .
the kirch group collapsed under a € 6.5 billion debt in april 2002 .
disagreements between kirchmedia and its advisers and creditors have hampered attempts to find a buyer for the company .
saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .
there he provided soundtracks for cartoon films and television series , finally hitting the big time with the japanese cartoon series " power rangers . " he recently sold his interests in fox family worldwide tv for $ 1.5 billion , which gave him the resources to try to break into german television .
critics , however , say the self-made tycoon left fox with a mountain of debt and point to the fact that the saban capital group , which he founded over a year ago , has no experience in investing in media companies . if saban 's bid goes through , he will become one of germany 's most important media managers almost overnight .
the board of creditors , a collection of banks and hollywood film studios owed money by kirchmedia , have given ceo ziems until sunday to finalize negotiations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .

djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .
though derided for his fondness for big cars and flashy suits , djindjic 's trade of milosevic for $ 1.2 billion in international economic aid appeared to have won respect from people desperate to improve a living standard that ranks among the lowest in europe .
role in kosovo urged he also helped preside over the end of yugoslavia and the creation of the country of serbia-montenegro last month .
also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .
a nato-led peacekeeping force of 30,000 troops is stationed in kosovo , which remains part of yugoslavia .

one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .
both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race . " kirchmedia a lucrative draw kirchmedia , the most lucrative leftover of the insolvent kirch group , not only owns germany 's most extensive film rights library with a catalogue of some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 televison series , but also has majority stake in the country 's largest free-to-air television network , prosiebensat1 . apparently it was the hefty price of the television operations which exceeded bauer 's willingness to pay . -lrb- however , some experts believed bauer 's stake in the rtl 2 channel could also have caused problems with germany 's monopolies commission . -rrb- kirchmedia was regarded as the jewel in the crown of bavarian entrepreneur leo kirch 's business empire .
the kirch group collapsed under a € 6.5 billion debt in april 2002 .
disagreements between kirchmedia and its advisers and creditors have hampered attempts to find a buyer for the company .
saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .
there he provided soundtracks for cartoon films and television series , finally hitting the big time with the japanese cartoon series " power rangers . " he recently sold his interests in fox family worldwide tv for $ 1.5 billion , which gave him the resources to try to break into german television .
critics , however , say the self-made tycoon left fox with a mountain of debt and point to the fact that the saban capital group , which he founded over a year ago , has no experience in investing in media companies . if saban 's bid goes through , he will become one of germany 's most important media managers almost overnight .
the board of creditors , a collection of banks and hollywood film studios owed money by kirchmedia , have given ceo ziems until sunday to finalize negotiations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world . the international criminal court , the world 's first independent , permanent and global war crimes tribunal , held its inaugural session on tuesday with the swearing-in of 18 judges . the court is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
the icc has been ratified by 89 countries , including all european union member states , as well as such war-torn nations as afghanistan , east timor and the democratic republic of congo .
one notable absentee from the list is the united states , which says it fears the court could be abused for politically motivated prosecutions .
other opponents include israel , china and iraq . washington 's worries although the united states under president bill clinton signed the 1998 rome statute setting out the icc 's jurisdiction , structure and functions , the bush administration has since backed away from the agreement .
washington says anti-american prosecutors could bring charges against u.s. troops or officials , both past and present .
the united states has been lobbying other nations to sign bilateral agreements under which neither party would bring the other ’ s citizens before the court .
washington 's stance has drawn criticism both at home and abroad .
benjamin ferencz , who served as a war crimes prosecutor for the u.s. at the nuremberg tribunals , said on his web site , " the current leadership in the united states seems to have forgotten the lessons we tried to teach the rest of the world . "
nevertheless , some human rights campaigners say the inauguration of the first 18 judges will make it more difficult for washington to undermine the court .
richard dicker of the human rights organization human rights watch told the news agency reuters , " the judges ' inauguration makes this court more unstoppable than ever . " genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes the icc will hear trials relating to genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and the " crime of aggression , " which has yet to be formally defined .
it will be authorized to deal only with crimes committed after july 2002 , when it officially came into being , and only in cases where the state in which the alleged crime was committed is unwilling or unable to hold its own trial .
furthermore , it will only have the authority to try cases where either the suspect comes from a state that has ratified the court , or the crime was committed in such a state , unless the u.n. security council refers a case to it .
200 cases pending since its official establishment , the court has received more than 200 complaints alleging war crimes .
no legal action can be taken until a chief prosecutor is appointed , a move expected to take place in april .
human rights organizations have hailed the inauguration of the court as the biggest step forward for world justice since the nuremberg tribunals .
u.n. secretary-general kofi annan was among hundreds of dignitaries invited to the opening ceremony . german among first judges appointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter kaul is the first german judge to be elected to the bench at the icc .
the court 's first 18 judges , 11 men and seven women , include the german career diplomat and lawyer hans-peter kaul -lrb- photo -rrb- .
kaul , born in 1943 , has served in consulates in norway , israel , and the united states , as well the german mission to the united nations .
he was also head of germany 's office for public international law , and has been involved in moves to set up the icc since 1996 .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .
dispute slows reform effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica djindjic 's feud with kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- since the two jointly toppled milosevic has virtually paralyzed the country 's much-needed economic and social reforms .
djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .
though derided for his fondness for big cars and flashy suits , djindjic 's trade of milosevic for $ 1.2 billion in international economic aid appeared to have won respect from people desperate to improve a living standard that ranks among the lowest in europe .
role in kosovo urged he also helped preside over the end of yugoslavia and the creation of the country of serbia-montenegro last month .
also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .
a nato-led peacekeeping force of 30,000 troops is stationed in kosovo , which remains part of yugoslavia .
a fitness enthusiast , djindjic was born in bosanski samac , in bosnia , the son of a yugoslav people 's army officer .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .

djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .

internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .

kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .

last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .
" two years ago , our main concern was a lack of qualified workers .
today , it ’ s a lack of financing .
what we 're experiencing is a reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , and a lack of venture capital .
it 's getting more and more difficult to raise funds for start-ups and early-stage investment , " he said .
jung added that those it firms who have survived despite difficult conditions deserved to be given a better chance .
3g phones provide a ray of hope while industry leaders say they do n't expect a major upturn until 2004 , they 're placing high hopes in the telecommunications market , led by w-lan -lrb- wireless local area network -rrb- technology for the internet and the third generation mobile telephone technology , 3g , known in germany as umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- . despite repeated delays in the launch of 3g technology in germany and the enormous price providers paid for their licenses -lrb- in the summer of 2000 , the german government auctioned the licenses to the six highest bidders , bringing in the equivalent of almost € 50 billion , or $ 50.3 bn . -rrb- , the industry expects 3g to be a major success in the medium term .
jung said , " we expect these innovations to open up genuine mass markets from 2005 onwards . " guest speaker jorma ollila of nokia echoed those hopes , saying , " mobility , in my view , is the next global megatrend .
the coming years will show its impact in shaping all areas of information technology , media and consumer industries alike .
everyone is a potential mobile consumer , and we all are becoming part of a truly mobile world . "
but first , it companies have to make it through 2003 .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .

"
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .
" two years ago , our main concern was a lack of qualified workers .
today , it ’ s a lack of financing .
what we 're experiencing is a reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , and a lack of venture capital .
it 's getting more and more difficult to raise funds for start-ups and early-stage investment , " he said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .
" curry sausage ca n't be turned into filet mignon overnight , " kauder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cities issue a plea for money confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .
dispute slows reform effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica djindjic 's feud with kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- since the two jointly toppled milosevic has virtually paralyzed the country 's much-needed economic and social reforms .
djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .
though derided for his fondness for big cars and flashy suits , djindjic 's trade of milosevic for $ 1.2 billion in international economic aid appeared to have won respect from people desperate to improve a living standard that ranks among the lowest in europe .
role in kosovo urged he also helped preside over the end of yugoslavia and the creation of the country of serbia-montenegro last month .
also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .
a nato-led peacekeeping force of 30,000 troops is stationed in kosovo , which remains part of yugoslavia .
a fitness enthusiast , djindjic was born in bosanski samac , in bosnia , the son of a yugoslav people 's army officer .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .

djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .

one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2003 cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking to the future : cebit kicks off in hanover the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .
the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .
" two years ago , our main concern was a lack of qualified workers .
today , it ’ s a lack of financing .
what we 're experiencing is a reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , and a lack of venture capital .
it 's getting more and more difficult to raise funds for start-ups and early-stage investment , " he said .
jung added that those it firms who have survived despite difficult conditions deserved to be given a better chance .
3g phones provide a ray of hope while industry leaders say they do n't expect a major upturn until 2004 , they 're placing high hopes in the telecommunications market , led by w-lan -lrb- wireless local area network -rrb- technology for the internet and the third generation mobile telephone technology , 3g , known in germany as umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- . despite repeated delays in the launch of 3g technology in germany and the enormous price providers paid for their licenses -lrb- in the summer of 2000 , the german government auctioned the licenses to the six highest bidders , bringing in the equivalent of almost € 50 billion , or $ 50.3 bn . -rrb- , the industry expects 3g to be a major success in the medium term .
jung said , " we expect these innovations to open up genuine mass markets from 2005 onwards . " guest speaker jorma ollila of nokia echoed those hopes , saying , " mobility , in my view , is the next global megatrend .
the coming years will show its impact in shaping all areas of information technology , media and consumer industries alike .
everyone is a potential mobile consumer , and we all are becoming part of a truly mobile world . "
but first , it companies have to make it through 2003 .
jung said he would be happy if he could count on positive growth at all , even if it 's less than one percent .
all in all , it looks like germany 's it industry could be in for another tough year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de split six ways : the umts market in germany the german market for third generation mobile phones is divided six ways .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .
" two years ago , our main concern was a lack of qualified workers .
today , it ’ s a lack of financing .
what we 're experiencing is a reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , and a lack of venture capital .
it 's getting more and more difficult to raise funds for start-ups and early-stage investment , " he said .
jung added that those it firms who have survived despite difficult conditions deserved to be given a better chance .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "

last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "

the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .
" curry sausage ca n't be turned into filet mignon overnight , " kauder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cities issue a plea for money confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .
kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .

" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .
kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "

but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world . the international criminal court , the world 's first independent , permanent and global war crimes tribunal , held its inaugural session on tuesday with the swearing-in of 18 judges . the court is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
the icc has been ratified by 89 countries , including all european union member states , as well as such war-torn nations as afghanistan , east timor and the democratic republic of congo .
one notable absentee from the list is the united states , which says it fears the court could be abused for politically motivated prosecutions .
other opponents include israel , china and iraq . washington 's worries although the united states under president bill clinton signed the 1998 rome statute setting out the icc 's jurisdiction , structure and functions , the bush administration has since backed away from the agreement .
washington says anti-american prosecutors could bring charges against u.s. troops or officials , both past and present .
the united states has been lobbying other nations to sign bilateral agreements under which neither party would bring the other ’ s citizens before the court .
washington 's stance has drawn criticism both at home and abroad .
benjamin ferencz , who served as a war crimes prosecutor for the u.s. at the nuremberg tribunals , said on his web site , " the current leadership in the united states seems to have forgotten the lessons we tried to teach the rest of the world . "
nevertheless , some human rights campaigners say the inauguration of the first 18 judges will make it more difficult for washington to undermine the court .
richard dicker of the human rights organization human rights watch told the news agency reuters , " the judges ' inauguration makes this court more unstoppable than ever . " genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes the icc will hear trials relating to genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and the " crime of aggression , " which has yet to be formally defined .
it will be authorized to deal only with crimes committed after july 2002 , when it officially came into being , and only in cases where the state in which the alleged crime was committed is unwilling or unable to hold its own trial .
furthermore , it will only have the authority to try cases where either the suspect comes from a state that has ratified the court , or the crime was committed in such a state , unless the u.n. security council refers a case to it .
200 cases pending since its official establishment , the court has received more than 200 complaints alleging war crimes .
no legal action can be taken until a chief prosecutor is appointed , a move expected to take place in april .
human rights organizations have hailed the inauguration of the court as the biggest step forward for world justice since the nuremberg tribunals .
u.n. secretary-general kofi annan was among hundreds of dignitaries invited to the opening ceremony . german among first judges appointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter kaul is the first german judge to be elected to the bench at the icc .
the court 's first 18 judges , 11 men and seven women , include the german career diplomat and lawyer hans-peter kaul -lrb- photo -rrb- .
kaul , born in 1943 , has served in consulates in norway , israel , and the united states , as well the german mission to the united nations .
he was also head of germany 's office for public international law , and has been involved in moves to set up the icc since 1996 .
many nongovernmental organizations involved in the campaign to create the court view him as a committed and cooperative partner who worked consistently and energetically toward the establishment of an independent and effective tribunal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hans-peter kaul - first german judge at war crimes court german diplomat and lawyer hans-peter kaul has been elected to the international criminal court in the hague .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.03.2003 cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking to the future : cebit kicks off in hanover the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .
the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .
" two years ago , our main concern was a lack of qualified workers .
today , it ’ s a lack of financing .
what we 're experiencing is a reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , and a lack of venture capital .
it 's getting more and more difficult to raise funds for start-ups and early-stage investment , " he said .
jung added that those it firms who have survived despite difficult conditions deserved to be given a better chance .
3g phones provide a ray of hope while industry leaders say they do n't expect a major upturn until 2004 , they 're placing high hopes in the telecommunications market , led by w-lan -lrb- wireless local area network -rrb- technology for the internet and the third generation mobile telephone technology , 3g , known in germany as umts -lrb- universal mobile telecommunications system -rrb- . despite repeated delays in the launch of 3g technology in germany and the enormous price providers paid for their licenses -lrb- in the summer of 2000 , the german government auctioned the licenses to the six highest bidders , bringing in the equivalent of almost € 50 billion , or $ 50.3 bn . -rrb- , the industry expects 3g to be a major success in the medium term .
jung said , " we expect these innovations to open up genuine mass markets from 2005 onwards . " guest speaker jorma ollila of nokia echoed those hopes , saying , " mobility , in my view , is the next global megatrend .
the coming years will show its impact in shaping all areas of information technology , media and consumer industries alike .
everyone is a potential mobile consumer , and we all are becoming part of a truly mobile world . "
but first , it companies have to make it through 2003 .
jung said he would be happy if he could count on positive growth at all , even if it 's less than one percent .
all in all , it looks like germany 's it industry could be in for another tough year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de split six ways : the umts market in germany the german market for third generation mobile phones is divided six ways .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .
dispute slows reform effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica djindjic 's feud with kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- since the two jointly toppled milosevic has virtually paralyzed the country 's much-needed economic and social reforms .
djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .
though derided for his fondness for big cars and flashy suits , djindjic 's trade of milosevic for $ 1.2 billion in international economic aid appeared to have won respect from people desperate to improve a living standard that ranks among the lowest in europe .
role in kosovo urged he also helped preside over the end of yugoslavia and the creation of the country of serbia-montenegro last month .
also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .
a nato-led peacekeeping force of 30,000 troops is stationed in kosovo , which remains part of yugoslavia .
a fitness enthusiast , djindjic was born in bosanski samac , in bosnia , the son of a yugoslav people 's army officer .

" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .

but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world . the international criminal court , the world 's first independent , permanent and global war crimes tribunal , held its inaugural session on tuesday with the swearing-in of 18 judges . the court is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
the icc has been ratified by 89 countries , including all european union member states , as well as such war-torn nations as afghanistan , east timor and the democratic republic of congo .
one notable absentee from the list is the united states , which says it fears the court could be abused for politically motivated prosecutions .
other opponents include israel , china and iraq . washington 's worries although the united states under president bill clinton signed the 1998 rome statute setting out the icc 's jurisdiction , structure and functions , the bush administration has since backed away from the agreement .
washington says anti-american prosecutors could bring charges against u.s. troops or officials , both past and present .
the united states has been lobbying other nations to sign bilateral agreements under which neither party would bring the other ’ s citizens before the court .
washington 's stance has drawn criticism both at home and abroad .

but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world . the international criminal court , the world 's first independent , permanent and global war crimes tribunal , held its inaugural session on tuesday with the swearing-in of 18 judges . the court is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
the icc has been ratified by 89 countries , including all european union member states , as well as such war-torn nations as afghanistan , east timor and the democratic republic of congo .
one notable absentee from the list is the united states , which says it fears the court could be abused for politically motivated prosecutions .
other opponents include israel , china and iraq . washington 's worries although the united states under president bill clinton signed the 1998 rome statute setting out the icc 's jurisdiction , structure and functions , the bush administration has since backed away from the agreement .
washington says anti-american prosecutors could bring charges against u.s. troops or officials , both past and present .
the united states has been lobbying other nations to sign bilateral agreements under which neither party would bring the other ’ s citizens before the court .
washington 's stance has drawn criticism both at home and abroad .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .
kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .

one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .
both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race . " kirchmedia a lucrative draw kirchmedia , the most lucrative leftover of the insolvent kirch group , not only owns germany 's most extensive film rights library with a catalogue of some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 televison series , but also has majority stake in the country 's largest free-to-air television network , prosiebensat1 . apparently it was the hefty price of the television operations which exceeded bauer 's willingness to pay . -lrb- however , some experts believed bauer 's stake in the rtl 2 channel could also have caused problems with germany 's monopolies commission . -rrb- kirchmedia was regarded as the jewel in the crown of bavarian entrepreneur leo kirch 's business empire .
the kirch group collapsed under a € 6.5 billion debt in april 2002 .
disagreements between kirchmedia and its advisers and creditors have hampered attempts to find a buyer for the company .
saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .
there he provided soundtracks for cartoon films and television series , finally hitting the big time with the japanese cartoon series " power rangers . " he recently sold his interests in fox family worldwide tv for $ 1.5 billion , which gave him the resources to try to break into german television .
critics , however , say the self-made tycoon left fox with a mountain of debt and point to the fact that the saban capital group , which he founded over a year ago , has no experience in investing in media companies . if saban 's bid goes through , he will become one of germany 's most important media managers almost overnight .
the board of creditors , a collection of banks and hollywood film studios owed money by kirchmedia , have given ceo ziems until sunday to finalize negotiations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .

but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world . the international criminal court , the world 's first independent , permanent and global war crimes tribunal , held its inaugural session on tuesday with the swearing-in of 18 judges . the court is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc is based on the principles of the nuremberg tribunals set up after world war ii to try nazi german leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
the icc has been ratified by 89 countries , including all european union member states , as well as such war-torn nations as afghanistan , east timor and the democratic republic of congo .
one notable absentee from the list is the united states , which says it fears the court could be abused for politically motivated prosecutions .
other opponents include israel , china and iraq . washington 's worries although the united states under president bill clinton signed the 1998 rome statute setting out the icc 's jurisdiction , structure and functions , the bush administration has since backed away from the agreement .
washington says anti-american prosecutors could bring charges against u.s. troops or officials , both past and present .
the united states has been lobbying other nations to sign bilateral agreements under which neither party would bring the other ’ s citizens before the court .
washington 's stance has drawn criticism both at home and abroad .
benjamin ferencz , who served as a war crimes prosecutor for the u.s. at the nuremberg tribunals , said on his web site , " the current leadership in the united states seems to have forgotten the lessons we tried to teach the rest of the world . "
nevertheless , some human rights campaigners say the inauguration of the first 18 judges will make it more difficult for washington to undermine the court .
richard dicker of the human rights organization human rights watch told the news agency reuters , " the judges ' inauguration makes this court more unstoppable than ever . " genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes the icc will hear trials relating to genocide , crimes against humanity , war crimes and the " crime of aggression , " which has yet to be formally defined .
it will be authorized to deal only with crimes committed after july 2002 , when it officially came into being , and only in cases where the state in which the alleged crime was committed is unwilling or unable to hold its own trial .
furthermore , it will only have the authority to try cases where either the suspect comes from a state that has ratified the court , or the crime was committed in such a state , unless the u.n. security council refers a case to it .
200 cases pending since its official establishment , the court has received more than 200 complaints alleging war crimes .
no legal action can be taken until a chief prosecutor is appointed , a move expected to take place in april .
human rights organizations have hailed the inauguration of the court as the biggest step forward for world justice since the nuremberg tribunals .
u.n. secretary-general kofi annan was among hundreds of dignitaries invited to the opening ceremony . german among first judges appointed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-peter kaul is the first german judge to be elected to the bench at the icc .
the court 's first 18 judges , 11 men and seven women , include the german career diplomat and lawyer hans-peter kaul -lrb- photo -rrb- .
kaul , born in 1943 , has served in consulates in norway , israel , and the united states , as well the german mission to the united nations .
he was also head of germany 's office for public international law , and has been involved in moves to set up the icc since 1996 .

germany pledges to continue to support the young democracy . the assassination of serbian prime minister zoran djindjic on wednesday could endanger the drive for democracy that he launched in the balkan country after the overthrow of slobodan milosevic , german specialists in the region say .
" djindjic stood like no other for reform , " said marie-janine calic of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" this push has suffered a severe setback . "
the 50-year-old djindjic , the man who made many enemies after he helped topple former yugoslav president milosevic , was cut down by sniper bullets on wednesday .
djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .
dispute slows reform effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vojislav kostunica djindjic 's feud with kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- since the two jointly toppled milosevic has virtually paralyzed the country 's much-needed economic and social reforms .
djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .
though derided for his fondness for big cars and flashy suits , djindjic 's trade of milosevic for $ 1.2 billion in international economic aid appeared to have won respect from people desperate to improve a living standard that ranks among the lowest in europe .
role in kosovo urged he also helped preside over the end of yugoslavia and the creation of the country of serbia-montenegro last month .
also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .
a nato-led peacekeeping force of 30,000 troops is stationed in kosovo , which remains part of yugoslavia .
a fitness enthusiast , djindjic was born in bosanski samac , in bosnia , the son of a yugoslav people 's army officer .

djindjic was shot by two large caliber sniper bullets fired from a distance , a police source said .
sources from djindjic 's cabinet told the associated press that the bullets struck djindjic in the stomach and back , and that doctors were " fighting for his life " in belgrade 's emergency hospital .
a short time later , a source from his democratic party said the fight had been futile .
" he 's dead , " the source said .
two people arrested in the attack the shooting occurred about 11:45 a.m. local time outside the main government building in belgrade .
police cordoned off the building after the shoot-out and government ministers immediately met in emergency session , a government source said .
two people were arrested , witnesses said .
the prime minister was killed at a particularly uncertain time in serbia , a country still reeling from the effects of the balkan wars of the 1990s and nato 's air war in 1999 .
the country of yugoslavia was formally buried last month .
in its place , the union of serbia and montenegro was created .
serbia does not have an elected president at the moment because efforts to elect a new leader have failed .
" djindjic 's death creates a large amount of instability because it does not have an elected president or a prime minister , " said franz-lothar altmann , another balkan specialist at the foundation .
" the serbian do n't have any idea either who can and should be his successor . "
one of those possible candidates could be his nemesis , former yugoslav president vojislav kostunica .
the instability could accelerate into violence , altmann said .
" radical elements could see this as an opportunity to impose a state of emergency , and call out the police and army , " he said .
in belgrade , the cabinet seemed to have similar thoughts .
after meeting in emergency session and declaring three days of mourning , the government asked acting serbian president natasa micic to consider imposing a " nationwide " state of emergency that would give the military the same powers as police to detain suspects and investigate .
fischer promises german support german foreign minister joschka fischer also recognized the potential dangers that could arise after the assassination and he pledged that germany would press forward with its effort to establish a democracy in the balkan country .
" this horrible signal from belgrad must not be allowed under any circumstances to impede this process , " fischer said .
djindjic appeared to have been targeted last month , when a truck suddenly cut into the lane in which his motorcade was traveling to belgrade 's airport .
djindjic then suggested the near-miss could have been linked to efforts by his government to stamp out the organized crime that flourished during the rule of milosevic .
" if someone thinks the law and the reforms can be stopped by eliminating me , then that is a huge delusion , " djindjic was quoted as saying by the politika newspaper at the time .
djindjic , who spearheaded the popular revolt that toppled milosevic in october 2000 , had many enemies because of his pro-reformist and western stands .
he saw serbia 's fate as linked to the west and has favored greater cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands investigating the balkan wars of the 1990s .
he was pivotal in arresting and handing milosevic to the tribunal in june 2001 .
for this , he was blasted by serbian nationalists , including kostunica .

djindjic was often criticized by his opponents for seeking too much power and for " mercilessly " combating his political rivals .
he was a german-educated technocrat known to supporters as " the manager " for his organizational skills and as " little slobo " to his detractors for his authoritarian tendencies like those of the real slobo , milosevic .

also last month , djindjic 's government asked nato for permission to send troops back to kosovo , nearly four years after the nato warplanes bombed serb forces to oust them from the province , if there is a war in iraq .
djindjic said serb troops would fill any security vacuum in kosovo if nato withdrew troops for military action in iraq .
however , no plans have been announced to reduce the number of troops in the peacekeeping force because of the iraqi crisis .
kosovo has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato fought an air war to end then-yugoslav president milosevic 's crackdown on the province 's independence-minded ethnic albanians .

one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .
both bids were reportedly worth some € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- . bauer spokesman andreas fritzenkötter said on wednesday the company was not prepared to take part in a " bidding race . " kirchmedia a lucrative draw kirchmedia , the most lucrative leftover of the insolvent kirch group , not only owns germany 's most extensive film rights library with a catalogue of some 13,000 feature films and 3,000 televison series , but also has majority stake in the country 's largest free-to-air television network , prosiebensat1 . apparently it was the hefty price of the television operations which exceeded bauer 's willingness to pay . -lrb- however , some experts believed bauer 's stake in the rtl 2 channel could also have caused problems with germany 's monopolies commission . -rrb- kirchmedia was regarded as the jewel in the crown of bavarian entrepreneur leo kirch 's business empire .
the kirch group collapsed under a € 6.5 billion debt in april 2002 .
disagreements between kirchmedia and its advisers and creditors have hampered attempts to find a buyer for the company .
saban , who is supported by france 's private tv station tf1 , has offered around € 2 billion for kirchmedia . the egyptian-born 58-year-old has excellent contacts in both germany and hollywood and is credited with shrewd business sense .
he has promised the bavarian government to keep kirchmedia in munich and not to cut jobs at the company - in direct contrast to bauer , which the service sector union ver.di says was pushing for job cuts . a self-made media tycoon having started his career as a music producer in tel aviv , saban moved to paris after the 1973 yom kippur war .
there he provided soundtracks for cartoon films and television series , finally hitting the big time with the japanese cartoon series " power rangers . " he recently sold his interests in fox family worldwide tv for $ 1.5 billion , which gave him the resources to try to break into german television .
critics , however , say the self-made tycoon left fox with a mountain of debt and point to the fact that the saban capital group , which he founded over a year ago , has no experience in investing in media companies . if saban 's bid goes through , he will become one of germany 's most important media managers almost overnight .
the board of creditors , a collection of banks and hollywood film studios owed money by kirchmedia , have given ceo ziems until sunday to finalize negotiations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday . an american businessman is tipped to clinch a deal to buy up the bankrupt kirchmedia group this week . kirchmedia ceo hans-joachim ziems has confirmed that negotiations with california media mogul haim saban are now in their final phase .
he said on wednesday all that now remained was to make saban 's bid " watertight . " saban 's bid has pushed out the bauer verlag , germany 's largest publisher of tv and entertainment magazines , that was the hot favorite to take over kirchmedia .
last december , managers of kirchmedia , which owns a controlling stake in broadcaster prosiebensat1 and europe 's largest library of film rights , agreed to sell the business to the hamburg-based bauer publishing group and creditor banks including germany 's hvb . but the deal fell through after disagreement over the film-rights business and paved the way for saban , the former owner of fox television and french television francaise 1 . bauer - which has a major stake in another leading broadcaster , rtl 2 - pulled out of the bidding together with junior partner , munich-based hypovereinsbank , after saban topped his offer by some € 100 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- over the weekend .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .

"
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .
" two years ago , our main concern was a lack of qualified workers .
today , it ’ s a lack of financing .
what we 're experiencing is a reluctance on the part of banks to lend money , and a lack of venture capital .
it 's getting more and more difficult to raise funds for start-ups and early-stage investment , " he said .
jung added that those it firms who have survived despite difficult conditions deserved to be given a better chance .

the mood is more somber than in previous years . the german chancellor , gerhard schröder , formally opened the cebit trade fair in hanover on tuesday with a promise of social , economic and labor market reforms which he said would help restore confidence and stimulate growth in the country 's struggling it industry . schröder painted a rosy future for the industry in germany , saying the cebit fair showed that " the it sector would return to the path of growth after a necessary but difficult period of adjustment . "
gloomy outlook industry leaders , however , do not share the chancellor 's optimism , and the sense of doom and gloom that has gripped it firms over the past two years was palpable in hanover . for the second year running , less companies have booked floor space , and organizers are expecting a decrease in visitors .
only 6,526 exhibitors are taking part this year , down 700 over 2002 , and organizers are expecting the number of visitors to fall from about 674,000 to just 600,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cebit 2003 : less exhibitors , less visitors those figures are a reflection of the sector 's troubles as a whole .
the industry 's umbrella organization in germany , bitkom , says some 2,000 firms disappeared from the market in 2002 .
three-quarters of these , it says , were wound up as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency , and a quarter swallowed up through takeovers and mergers .
bitkom says 35,000 jobs were lost in 2002 , and warns that a further 10,000 could be shed in 2003 .
call for less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder chats with nokia ceo jorma ollila at the opening of the cebit fair in hanover chancellor schröder was joined at the opening ceremony by bitkom president , volker jung , and jorma ollila , ceo of the finnish mobile telephone manufacturer nokia -lrb- photo -rrb- . while schröder put some of the blame for poor growth figures in germany on the global economic situation , coupled with the effects of the iraq crisis , jung countered by calling on the government to implement reforms and to break what he called " a cartel of trade unions and employees who force through their own interests at the expense of companies and the unemployed . "
jung urged the government to make its decision-making processes more transparent and predictable , so that firms could plan more reliably for the future .
he also said rules and regulations were strangling german industry .
" the motto is : less is more .
less bureaucracy , less taxes , less non-wage costs , less restrictive labor laws , less regulations - in short - less state interference , " he said .
call for more investment at the same time , he called on the banking industry to invest more in hi-tech firms , noting that the challenges facing it companies today are changing .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.03.2003 schröder will focus on unemployment , aid to cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the job : chancellor gerhard schröder is planning to offer aid to the country 's battered builders .
german chancellor gerhard schröder will make a major economic address on friday .
but details have already begun to leak out about his plans - cuts in jobless aid and help for builders . chancellor gerhard schröder still had three days of time on tuesday to read , refine and rehearse the direction-setting speech he intends to deliver to the country 's parliament .
but horst siebert , one of germany 's leading economists , has already made up his mind about what schröder should say .
" the key problems of weak growth , rigidly high levels of unemployment and the financing of the social-services system are tangled into a knot and must be addressed with one complete concept , " siebert said in an interview with the news agency dpa .
the speech siebert is referring to will be delivered on friday in berlin .
it will be called " the courage to seek peace , the courage to seek change . "
the social bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder democratic chancellor decided to make it after his efforts to find a consensus solution on such things as unemployment between the country 's business community and unions collapsed during a final round of discord on march 3 .
now , schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- is changing his tactics , shifting from being the broker of competing interests to the generator of fundamental reforms .
" i will not negotiate , " he said recently .
details of plans leak out since the chancellor announced his intentions last week , details of his address have begun to trickle out from various sources - a comment from social democrats here , a newspaper story there .
based on these reports , the chancellor is working on just the subjects that siebert has suggested he should .
between monday evening and tuesday , the chancellor met with his own party members and with his coalition partner , the greens , to talk over the speech .
afterward , sources said schröder had three spending plans in mind - a national apartment renovation plan , financed by low-interest loans totaling € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- , that would help the country 's struggling construction industry , a similar € 7.5 billion program that would finance capital investment projects in germany 's money-short cities and a separate aid program totaling € 2 billion to help those same communities .
these comments were accompanied by the publication on tuesday of a report in the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering newspaper die welt about other plans .
it reported that schröder would propose to cut the maximum period that a person may draw unemployment benefits from 32 months to 18 or 12 months .
franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the social democrats parliamentary group in berlin , confirmed in a radio interview on tuesday morning that schröder was indeed considering such a cut .
müntefering also explained the rationale behind the proposal .
he said many companies had turned the 32-month payments into a bridge leading to early retirement for many employees .
such a practice creates an extra burden on workers still paying into the system , die welt reported .
müntefering said the governing coalition of social democrats and greens also had a clear timetable for its reforms .
" by summer , the coalition will make its decisions on economic growth , the job market and workers ' rights , " he said .
not everyone in the social democrats ' parliamentary group is happy about schröder 's plans .
" the social democrats ' left wing will not join the effort if the social state is to be turned into a social state lite , " said michael müller , a vice chairman of the party 's parliamentary group .
the social democrat who chairs the parliamentary economic affairs committee acknowledged on wednesday that some members were upset .
but rainer wend told the news agency reuters that schröder would win the support of his party 's lawmakers .
pointing to their governmental responsibilities , wend said , " the parliamentary group can not avoid the program . "
reasons for reforms the government is being forced to act for a number of economic reasons .
last year , the german economy grew by 0.2 percent , the lowest rate since the country suffered through a recession in 1993 .
and the institute that siebert directs , the kiel institute for world economics , gave schröder little reason on tuesday to think that the economy would pick up any time soon .
in the face of the crisis over iraq , higher oil prices and a stronger euro , the institute reduced its economic growth forecast for 2003 from 1 percent to 0.4 percent .
furthermore , the jobless rate rose from 11.1 percent in january to 11.3 percent in february - 4.706 million people were out of work .
with the increase , the jobless totals are continuing to head back toward the country 's worst levels , which were set in january and february 1998 , when more than 4.8 million were out of work .
in addition , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
" the country is in a crisis , " siebert said .
" and it is not just experiencing a cyclical economic downturn but is overburdened with massive long-term structural problems .
we are experiencing our third year of stagnation in a row . "
members of the parliamentary opposition , like the christian democrat volker kauder , are not so excited about friday 's speech and are playing down their expectations .
" curry sausage ca n't be turned into filet mignon overnight , " kauder said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cities issue a plea for money confronted by a huge drop in tax revenues and a troubled economy , german cities are running up huge deficits , and now they are crying out for help .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .
kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .

as the world 's largest computer fair kicks off in hanover , experts are highlighting the problem of internet addiction .
it afflicts an estimated 1 million germans and has disastrous social consequences . they turn the night into day , give themselves funky names such as " jocool " , " kreec " or " juliese " , know their chat partners better than their own kids , partners and friends , and often end up facing the collapse of social and personal relationships .
internet addiction is the name of the game , and experts say it ’ s taking on frightening proportions in germany .
just a day before the cebit - the world ’ s largest computer fair which presents the latest hi-tech products and trends in the computer world - began in hanover on wednesday , experts were ringing alarm bells to highlight a problem they say the technology sector would rather turn a blind eye to : an increasing number of people can no longer control when they switch on their computers and enter the world wide web .
one million germans are online addicts although there are no exact statistics on the number of people who can be described as internet addicts in germany , experts say the number is close to 1 million .
the number amounts to about 3 percent of the on-line population in the country .
andré hahn of the market research organization research international conducted a study two years ago on the phenomenon and found that 2.67 percent of internet users in germany displayed acute symptoms of addiction .
" this percentage has not changed up to today , but the number of internet users has risen in the time from 25 to 30 million , " he told dw-world .
" drug available much too easily " usually those addicted to the internet display the same behavior : they spend increasing amounts of time on-line , ignore their families , friends , school and work .
for such people , the internet is often a drug that helps compensate for problems .
for instance , those who lack self-confidence can often assume a new , stronger identity in chat rooms or in on-line games .
others are addicted to on-line sex .
astronomical telephone bills - a common occurrence until recently when flat rates and fixed tariffs were introduced - also drove many internet addicts to bankruptcy .
" the flat rates have lowered the financial risks for the addicts .
but , on the other hand , the conditions for entrance have been considerably lowered , too .
now , the drug is available much too easily , " hahn said .
the researcher said that much like conventional drug addicts , internet addicts show psychological withdrawal symptoms if they don ’ t get access to the net : they often become nervous , irritable , and at times even aggressive and unfocused . "
internet became more important than family " gabriele farke is a case in point .
the 47-year-old industrial sales representative acknowledged that she was an internet addict for over two years . she said the problem began with innocuous surfing for a couple of hours in the office .
she then bought a computer , and the harmless pleasure turned into a numbing addiction as she began to spend hours surfing the net after she got home from work .
" the internet became more important to me than my family , " she told dw-world .
farke spent hours on end in chat rooms , discussed under a variety of pseudonyms until the early morning hours with fellow junkies who she felt understood her better than her own friends .
in retrospect , farke described her obsessive chatting as " superficial hogwash . "
she said she displayed all the symptoms of a classic internet addict : she lost her social contacts and her daughter felt ignored and left home at 18 .
farke lost her job and is still reeling under the financial implications of her telephone bills .
moved by her own experience with internet addiction , farke wrote a book about it .
the cathartic therapy helped her break out of the addiction cycle .
in 1999 , she founded a self-help organization for internet addicts wanting to kick the habit .
industry and politics not taking responsibility though on-line addiction has now been recognized as a serious problem , the question of whom to hold responsible for it is a difficult one .
wolfgang schmidt , head of the regional center for addiction-related questions in the state of hesse , said that on-line addiction was just not taken seriously enough by business and politics .
" in public debates and discussions , the internet is only good and modern . even all schools are now supposed to be linked to the internet , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
schmidt said that the policy was good in principle , but there was a minority of people who were susceptible to enslavement through new technology .
he urged that both industry and politics should at least acknowledge responsibility , and finance independent studies to determine the size of the problem .
kicking the internet habit not easy internet addiction is still a relatively new phenomenon , and psychologists and psychiatrists are still researching the actual causes and forms that the addiction can take .
werner platz , a psychiatrist at the free university in berlin , has been counseling internet addicts for several years .
he described the addiction as a modern form of gambling that often conceals underlying psychological disorders such as depression .
platz said internet addicts often displayed a susceptibility for addiction that can manifest itself in another obsession if the root psychological cause was not treated .
he said therapy for such addicts is a step by step process , in which the on-line junkies gradually need to reduce the time they spend surfing on the internet and at the same time seek counseling to talk about their experiences .
but even if the on-line addicts are eventually weaned off the habit , information technology already has new attractions in store that can easily turn into potential obsessions for hi-tech nerds .
several thousand people are already thought to be suffering from the addiction to sms -lrb- short messaging service -rrb- texting . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making the internet visible for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities .

cornwall had been expecting to win millions of pounds more in the next round of european funding .
but now it is feared that could all change - with cornwall losing out to other parts of the country .
the concerns stem from the expansion of the european union .
objective one march 1999 , cornwall & scilly designated region 's prosperity must be below 75 % of the european average £ 300m available , but it has to be matched with money from public or private sector many of the new countries are extremely poor , but that means that in future , the pot of objective one money will be spread more thinly .
the government thinks the uk will be worse off , so it is proposing a new system - one in which it decides where the share of the funds should be spent .
cornwall believes this would mean the money being targeted elsewhere - in political hotspots .
robin teverson , of finance cornwall , which helps with match funding , said : " whitehall in the past has always been in charge of regional funding , but where has it gone ?
" it 's gone to scotland , to wales and the north , and here in cornwall where ministers maybe came for their holidays , and saw a beautiful environment , they did not see the rural poverty and the declining industries .
" we wo n't get the money . "
the government has put out a consultation document on its plans and has denied cornwall will lose out .
it said it would invest more money in the regions and that everyone will benefit .

the fall is unlikely to come as much surprise either to policy-makers or investors , given the tough times afflicting economies around the globe .
despite a crippling drought australia has thus far escaped the worst of the downturn , with the australian dollar at three-year highs , growth solidly above 3 % a year and exports doing well .
but with consumers - and businesses too - now apparently losing their bottle in the face of continued stock market losses and impending war , the country could yet succumb to the same problems as elsewhere .
bricks and mortar march 's consumer confidence reading , according to the westpac-melbourne institute regular survey , was 97.6 , a 2.1 % fall from the month before to a 22-month low .
in february the fall had been even more marked , down 7.8 % to below the 100-point level which separates optimism from pessimism .
the combination suggests that there could be trouble in store for australia 's retailers , the biggest of which - coles myer - is already reporting a slowdown in sales growth .
on tuesday , national australia bank said business confidence had dropped to its worst level since 11 september .
but the housing market is staying vibrant , as australians move into bricks and mortar as a safer investment than equities .
housing finance rose a seasonally-adjusted 1 % in january , and things could get even more bullish in april if - as economists generally expect - the reserve bank of australia drops interest rates by a quarter of a point to 4.5 % .

on tuesday , the anglo-dutch steel firm announced it was planning " significant " reductions in capacity at uk plants in an attempt to stop losing £ 1m a day .
union representatives are now seeking an urgent meeting with corus managers to discuss the announcement .
it is thought the port talbot works will be safe , but some analysts expect corus to complete the closure of the llanwern works , in newport , which still employs 1,500 people .
however , the company is facing intense pressure from unions and politicians to keep its uk plants open .
in tuesday 's announcement , the steelmaker refused to go into details but has warned that it needed to reduce its losses of almost £ 400m .
corus jobs in wales 8,000 in total port talbot - 3,000 llanwern , newport - 1,500 trostre , llanelli - 1,000 shotton , flintshire - 800 some analysts picked out plants at teesside and scunthorpe as the most vulnerable to closure .
however , port talbot , which employs 3,000 people directly with around 5,500 contractors in addition , is also one of corus ' top uk plants and the announcement has inevitably prompted fears for its future .
if port talbot were to close , experts estimate that for every job which could go at the site , an equal number of jobs would be lost in the wider economy of south and west wales .
this would follow on from 3,000 job cuts corus made at its plants in wales in 2001 .
however , corus invested £ 75m in a new blast furnace at port talbot after an explosion in november 2001 which killed three workers .
the new furnace was opened in january 2003 - a development which was seen as a sign of the firm 's commitment to steel-making at the site .
elsewhere in wales , 1,000 workers are employed at trostre in llanelli and 800 at shotton in flintshire .
other staff also work at a variety of ancillary works and services .
