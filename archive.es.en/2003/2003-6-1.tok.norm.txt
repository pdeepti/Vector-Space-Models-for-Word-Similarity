observers say the protesters , carrying anti-war banners and beating drums , set out early on sunday morning from near the town of annemasse and are heading towards thonon , about six miles -lrb- 10km -rrb- west of evian .
french and swiss police have mobilised to prevent anti-capitalist protests disrupting the g8 summit , and a large security cordon is being enforced around the summit venue in anticipation of the marchers .
the protests come as many world leaders , including us president george w bush , are arriving in the town for the summit .
disparate protesters on saturday french police fired tear gas at hundreds of anti-globalisation protesters who had gathered ahead of the summit in annemasse .
more pictures of g8 protests eyewitnesses said the protesters were pushed back by riot police when they disrupted a meeting of french socialist party activists by throwing rocks at a conference centre .
there were also reports of petrol bombs being thrown at a local government building , french news agency afp said .
tens of thousands of demonstrators have descended on the french-swiss border close to geneva , hoping to disrupt the summit , which they say will do little to address the needs of the world 's poor .
but correspondents say the protesters are a disparate bunch of people , with differences of opinion over methods and ideology .
the socialists had to suspend their meeting , which was to discuss alternatives to globalisation .
police drafted most g8 leaders are staying around evian , but several prime ministers and presidents who are summit guests , including chinese president hu jintao , are staying in lausanne , on the swiss side , and will travel across lake geneva .
france and switzerland have spent months planning the security operation for the summit .
thousands of police from both countries have been drafted in , as well as from germany .
they are hoping to avoid a repetition of the violence at the g8 summit in genoa , italy , two years ago when an italian protester was shot dead by police .
the group of eight countries are the united states , japan , germany , uk , france , italy , canada and russia .

the $ 25bn project is the largest hydro-electric power project in the world , but years of controversy have surrounded its building .
the three gorges dam looms 300 metres above the yangtze river in central china .
its construction wo n't be completed until the end of the decade , but on sunday the water level in its reservoir will be allowed to start rising and in the coming years the dam will create a lake 600 kilometres long .
more than 600,000 people have already been resettled from areas that will be flooded .
entire towns will disappear .
china 's communist party leaders have portrayed the dam as a triumph of engineering and of socialism .
they say it will mean an end to catastrophic flooding along the yangtze and it will provide hydroelectric power to a thirsty chinese economy .
but the dam 's detractors are many and vocal .
environmentalists warn of serious damage to the eco-system ; engineers have expressed worries about construction standards , and the project has been dogged by allegations of corruption .
unusually , much of this criticism has come from inside china ; the project has been a lightning rod for dissent here .
but as the sluice gates close and the water level starts to rise , china 's communist party will point to this colossal construction effort as evidence of its technological prowess and its ability to engineer change in china .

" it 's kind of intimidating , " acknowledges lobby assistant j p cadeau , who offers visitors a squirt of anti-bacterial cleaner .
the resurgence in toronto of sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - has forced health officials to put hospitals back on high alert for the mysterious disease .
and that means at st mike 's that there are again just two entrances , one for the emergency room and one for everyone else .
and they are strictly controlled .
battle resurfaces visiting hours are restricted to just three hours on weekdays , but longer on weekends .
there 's no tourists .
who 's going to come here ?
toronto taxi driver staff screen everyone as they arrive , and hand visitors a lengthy questionnaire to assess their sars risk .
signs in six languages warn visitors of the disease 's symptoms .
after the discovery of a new cluster of cases in a hospital in the north end of the city , health officials who had declared the outbreak all but over in mid-may now say the battle against sars is back on .
they have been criticised by some for letting their guard down after the world health organization lifted its travel advisory on toronto on 29 april .
now , almost 8,000 people are in isolation .
as of friday there were 43 probable and 13 suspect cases of sars in the city .
another 149 were under investigation .
in all , 30 people have died .
tourism suffering dr james young , the commissioner of public security for the province of ontario , called this toronto 's " nervous weekend " , as officials watch for signs that the disease is spreading .
hotels say that vacancy rates remain high the strains on the already cash-strapped publicly-funded health system are obvious - many of those either sick or in isolation are health-care workers .
however , efforts by politicians and business leaders to convince the rest of canada and the world that toronto is a safe place to visit continue .
the risk to travellers and the general public from sars , officials maintain , is extremely low .
despite this , the tourism industry here is still hurting .
some downtown cab drivers say they are only half as busy as they usually are , and hotels say vacancy rates remain high .
thousands have lost their jobs .
" there 's no tourists .
who 's going to come here ? " says one driver in front of union station , near toronto 's signature cn tower .
concert hopes one toronto member of parliament , dennis mills , thinks he has a sure-fire plan to bring tourists - especially foreign ones - back to canada 's largest city .
he has been working feverishly to raise the $ 10m canadian dollars -lrb- $ 7.3m -rrb- he needs to stage a rock festival featuring the rolling stones and a host of other international and canadian acts on toronto 's waterfront in july .
hundreds of thousands of people would attend , he says , and the event - with toronto 's skyline in the background - would be beamed via satellite free of charge around the world , sending the message that the city is safe .
it was unclear whether he would raise enough money , from businesses and from government , to pay for the concert .
despite the news that sars is still with us , and the troubled tourism industry , most in toronto remain unconcerned about the disease .
you can spend hours on the streets and never see someone wearing a mask .
and a poll released over the weekend says 90 % of canadians are confident that their doctors and nurses will be able to contain the outbreak .

but the bird will have to earn its keep , as it has joined seven other ravens at the tower of london appointed to protect the british isles .
the raven 's flight of fancy began when it was discovered with an injured wing in the sand dunes near aberffraw beach in north wales by tom unite who lives in llanfaelog .
mr unite and his wife sandra , took the bird to the vet who suggested they got in touch with the tower .
it has now been collected by the attraction 's raven master derrick coyle .
they are caged overnight to protect them from predators and are fed six ounces of raw meat every day raven master derrick coyle ravens have been kept in the tower since king charles ii decreed there should always be at least six kept at all times .
legend has it that should the ravens ever leave the white tower it will crumble , and a great disaster befall the country .
the number of birds dropped to just one during world war ii , but the tradition has always remained .
blood-soaked biscuits mr coyle said the birds enjoyed a very good life in his care .
" ravens in the wild live to about 10 or 15 years , " he said .
" the oldest tower raven lived to the age of 44 and the current oldest is hardey , who is 26 .
" they are caged overnight to protect them from predators like the urban fox and are fed six ounces of raw meat every day . "
the birds ' diet consists of fresh chicken , beef or liver , a boiled egg every other day , fruit and the odd rabbit - complete with fur - for roughage " according to mr coyle .
they are also partial to bird formula biscuits soaked in blood .
the aberffraw raven with its injured wing is an ideal candidate for the group as it can not fly very well .
mr coyle clips the wings of the birds to unbalance them so that they do not stray too far away .
' unsatisfactory conduct ' however , the new bird in town will have to behave unless it wants to go the same way as one of its welsh predecessors .
george came to the tower in 1975 after being discovered with mate , larry , in penrhos , anglesey .
the first foundations of the tower of london were laid more than 900 years ago they were both named after the coastguards who found them , despite turning out to be female .
george , however , had to leave the tower in disgrace for " unsatisfactory conduct " in 1986 after he " developed an unhealthy taste in tv aerials . "
" he was very naughty and was sent away to the welsh mountain zoo , " says mr coyle .
the anglesey raven is currently at london zoo where it is being sexed .
as soon as it is known whether it is a male or female , a campaign will be launched to give it a name .
mr coyle is already suggesting the name of the latest addition to the historic aviary should reflect its welsh origins .

the number of birds dropped to just one during world war ii , but the tradition has always remained .
blood-soaked biscuits mr coyle said the birds enjoyed a very good life in his care .
" ravens in the wild live to about 10 or 15 years , " he said .
" the oldest tower raven lived to the age of 44 and the current oldest is hardey , who is 26 .
" they are caged overnight to protect them from predators like the urban fox and are fed six ounces of raw meat every day . "
the birds ' diet consists of fresh chicken , beef or liver , a boiled egg every other day , fruit and the odd rabbit - complete with fur - for roughage " according to mr coyle .
they are also partial to bird formula biscuits soaked in blood .
the aberffraw raven with its injured wing is an ideal candidate for the group as it can not fly very well .
mr coyle clips the wings of the birds to unbalance them so that they do not stray too far away .
' unsatisfactory conduct ' however , the new bird in town will have to behave unless it wants to go the same way as one of its welsh predecessors .
george came to the tower in 1975 after being discovered with mate , larry , in penrhos , anglesey .
the first foundations of the tower of london were laid more than 900 years ago they were both named after the coastguards who found them , despite turning out to be female .
george , however , had to leave the tower in disgrace for " unsatisfactory conduct " in 1986 after he " developed an unhealthy taste in tv aerials . "
" he was very naughty and was sent away to the welsh mountain zoo , " says mr coyle .
the anglesey raven is currently at london zoo where it is being sexed .
as soon as it is known whether it is a male or female , a campaign will be launched to give it a name .
mr coyle is already suggesting the name of the latest addition to the historic aviary should reflect its welsh origins .

police are convinced that the blaze which wrecked a grade ii listed slate hay shed at the museum of welsh life at st fagans , near cardiff , was started deliberately .
youths who had got into the grounds of were seen nearby shortly before the fire was discovered by a security guard .
firefighters were called to scene just after 2100 bst on friday evening .
the museum has remained open to visitors enjoyed a successful weekend despite the incident .
the open-sided barn - which was full of hay at the time of the fire - was built in 1870 and was acquired by the museum in 1977 .
the roof was made of slate , as were the slate pillars which support it .
the slate comes from the maentwrog , near porthmadog , in north wales and the building is one fo the last remaining in wales .
museum experts are expected to travel to north wales on monday to begin searching for suitable replacement materials .
john williams-davies said the roof had been completely destroyed and other parts would need extensive repairs .
" the fire did n't warrant closing the park , but it 's a blow to the building heritage of wales , " he said .
repair work will start as soon as possible , though it will mean other building projects will have to be postponed .
firefighters have been monitoring the scene and crews will return to the shed throughout the weekend to ensure the fire does not re-ignite in the hot weather .
a security guard on patrol saw two to three youths in the museum grounds after it had closed on friday .
it is thought they climbed over the security fence .
the guard said they fled when disturbed , but must have returned later and started the fire .
the st fagans site has established itself as one of europe 's foremost open-air , " living history " museums , and ranks as one of the most popular heritage attractions in wales .
traditional buildings from all over wales have been moved to the site , re-assembled and furnished with authentic pieces .
the collection includes a school , a chapel , a workmen 's institute , cottages , and agricultural buildings , and a police station .
last year the site was voted the top free-admission attraction in wales , after pulling in more than 600,000 visitors .
now one of the national museums and galleries of wales , the museum of welsh life opened in 1948 .
the museum 's aim is to demonstrate how the people of wales lived , worked and spent their leisure time during the past 500 years .
it stands in the grounds of the magnificent st fagans castle , a late 16th century manor house donated to the people of wales by the earl of plymouth .
the 100-acre parkland now has more than 30 original buildings .
craftsmen like blacksmiths and coopers provide working demonstrations in traditional costume , and there is a working bakery on site which sells fresh bread and cakes made to traditional welsh recipes .
native breeds of livestock can be seen in the fields and farmyards , and regular demonstrations of farming tasks take place daily .
