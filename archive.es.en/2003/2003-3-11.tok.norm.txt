but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .
increasingly tourists will choose to vacation in high security complexes , he said , akin to the gated holiday villages prevalent nowadays in caribbean hotspots like st. lucia and barbados . " when you travel to a tourist area in egypt these days you have to go through a checkpoint to get into the tourist zone , ” he said . “ it 's only once past this cordon that you can move freely .
but it 's not so much that tourists are traveling into a dangerous situation , rather they are taking their fear from home with them . " for khaula saleh , an arab journalist living in germany , the idea of packing tourists into gated communities is also not the answer .
" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly gay mayor , was at the itb marketing berlin as a top gay destination .

almost 53 percent of the island of 397,000 voted in favor of membership in the european union , an outcome that was anything but secure in the days leading up to saturday 's vote . the referendum , though non-binding , was seen as an important indicator of support for the eu course the government of prime minister eddie fenech ami and his conservative nationalist party has been taking .
the opposition labour party had campaigned heavily against entry , concerned that it would take away malta 's cherished neutrality and flood the island with property-buying europeans . some polls leading up to saturday 's referendum indicated that almost 60 percent of the population shared labour 's anti-eu stance . but the " yes " campaign run by the nationalist party won out .
a party source told the malta independent newspaper that the margin of victory was between 20,000 and 30,000 votes .
an estimated 91 percent of the 292,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum .
the eu declared malta a candidate for entry during a conference in copenhagen last december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 the rise and fall of the german loaf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last refuge of the old-style german baker faced with competition on an industrial scale and a dwindling customer base , germany 's traditional bakers could soon become a thing of the past . bakers are among germany 's most popular ambassadors : german bakers can be found all over the world , and they are doing very nicely , thank you .
but at home , it is a different story .
in particular , many smaller bakers are facing ruin – even though the average german chews his or her way through seven rolls , nearly 30 slices of bread , and a heap of cakes and pastries every week .
take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .
" that 's why they come to small stores . " sürth 's sales have risen a bit over the past few weeks , but the jump has n't turned him into an optimist .
" there 'll be fewer and fewer small bakers left because the big boys will push them out .
i can even see a time when there are none left at all .
that 'll be a pity . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german shopping trend mixes the great with the small 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

almost 53 percent of the island of 397,000 voted in favor of membership in the european union , an outcome that was anything but secure in the days leading up to saturday 's vote . the referendum , though non-binding , was seen as an important indicator of support for the eu course the government of prime minister eddie fenech ami and his conservative nationalist party has been taking .
the opposition labour party had campaigned heavily against entry , concerned that it would take away malta 's cherished neutrality and flood the island with property-buying europeans . some polls leading up to saturday 's referendum indicated that almost 60 percent of the population shared labour 's anti-eu stance . but the " yes " campaign run by the nationalist party won out .
a party source told the malta independent newspaper that the margin of victory was between 20,000 and 30,000 votes .
an estimated 91 percent of the 292,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum .
the eu declared malta a candidate for entry during a conference in copenhagen last december .

by evening , the stock had fallen 9.6 percent to € 9.15 -lrb- $ 10.09 -rrb- . europe 's biggest ever annual corporate loss came mainly from asset write-downs and charges totaling € 19.3 billion .
many of the companies that deutsche telekom acquired during the bullish 1990s were overpriced , and poor performance has meant their value has fallen sharply . core earnings in the fourth quarter also exceeded expectations , rising 14.6 percent to € 4.4 billion , and cuts to overall debt topped analysts ' forecasts as well .
income from fixed-line services is picking up again , and telekom 's cell-phone division , t-mobile , says it is optimistic its results this year will continue the upward trend started in the last part of 2002 . a turn for the better the turn-around in the company 's fortunes came after a year dogged by falling share prices and a bruising boardroom battle to oust long-term telekom boss ron sommer . the fallout from the fight to head the company has also led to a rash of personnel changes at the top .
the company 's new chief executive , kai-uwe ricke , still has a lot to do to turn the company around for good .
in particular , he has to do more to slash its mountain of debt , which analysts say reached € 61 billion last year . deutsche telekom hopes the continuing fall of the dollar against the euro will also help it to cut at least € 11 billion from that total by the end of 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ricke is new deutsche telekom boss deutsche telekom still behind in confidence stakes telekom appointment answers the 28 billion euro question 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .

anti-war protesters celebrated in the streets of the turkish capital ankara . in a surprise upset on saturday , turkey 's parliament decided not to allow u.s. troops to be stationed in the country in the event of an iraq war .
while 264 parliamentarians voted in favor of turkey functioning as a springboard for a u.s. offensive , 251 were opposed and 19 abstained . immediately after the vote reports were disseminated that the proposal had passed .
but parliamentary president bülent arinc later announced that it had actually failed because a majority of the parliamentarians present - 267 - had not voted in favor . the u.s. put pressure on turkey , a nato member country , to allow it to station 62,000 troops , 255 airplanes and 65 helicopters in the country .

a decision from the chamber had been delayed several times .
political observers speculated that the delay was caused by the government trying to ensure the proposal would be approved in parliament .
approval would also have sent turkish troops to northern iraq in the event of a war .
the government said they would be needed there both to prevent a refugee crisis and the creation of a kurdish state .
turkey fears that fighting in the region may re-ignite the kurdish conflict in turkey 's southeast .
prime minister abdullah gül , however , said on saturday that the country has a critical period ahead of it .
the government will examine what economic and political steps need to be taken , he announced .
gül said that the decision had not harmed u.s.-turkish relations , which " are safe in friendship and mutual understanding . "
another vote on the proposal to station u.s. troops in turkey is possible at a later date .
u.s. military circles reported that washington could quickly change its plans .

almost 53 percent of the island of 397,000 voted in favor of membership in the european union , an outcome that was anything but secure in the days leading up to saturday 's vote . the referendum , though non-binding , was seen as an important indicator of support for the eu course the government of prime minister eddie fenech ami and his conservative nationalist party has been taking .
the opposition labour party had campaigned heavily against entry , concerned that it would take away malta 's cherished neutrality and flood the island with property-buying europeans . some polls leading up to saturday 's referendum indicated that almost 60 percent of the population shared labour 's anti-eu stance . but the " yes " campaign run by the nationalist party won out .
a party source told the malta independent newspaper that the margin of victory was between 20,000 and 30,000 votes .
an estimated 91 percent of the 292,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum .
the eu declared malta a candidate for entry during a conference in copenhagen last december .
the nation is expected to join the eu with nine other countries in 2004 .
eight of the remaining nine countries will hold referendums this year , with slovenia holding the next vote on march 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political bickering mars malta 's eu vote the citizens of the island of malta go to the polls saturday to tell their government what they think of their country 's possible eu entry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .

in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states .

by evening , the stock had fallen 9.6 percent to € 9.15 -lrb- $ 10.09 -rrb- . europe 's biggest ever annual corporate loss came mainly from asset write-downs and charges totaling € 19.3 billion .
many of the companies that deutsche telekom acquired during the bullish 1990s were overpriced , and poor performance has meant their value has fallen sharply . core earnings in the fourth quarter also exceeded expectations , rising 14.6 percent to € 4.4 billion , and cuts to overall debt topped analysts ' forecasts as well .
income from fixed-line services is picking up again , and telekom 's cell-phone division , t-mobile , says it is optimistic its results this year will continue the upward trend started in the last part of 2002 . a turn for the better the turn-around in the company 's fortunes came after a year dogged by falling share prices and a bruising boardroom battle to oust long-term telekom boss ron sommer . the fallout from the fight to head the company has also led to a rash of personnel changes at the top .
the company 's new chief executive , kai-uwe ricke , still has a lot to do to turn the company around for good .
in particular , he has to do more to slash its mountain of debt , which analysts say reached € 61 billion last year . deutsche telekom hopes the continuing fall of the dollar against the euro will also help it to cut at least € 11 billion from that total by the end of 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ricke is new deutsche telekom boss deutsche telekom still behind in confidence stakes telekom appointment answers the 28 billion euro question 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states .

but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .
increasingly tourists will choose to vacation in high security complexes , he said , akin to the gated holiday villages prevalent nowadays in caribbean hotspots like st. lucia and barbados . " when you travel to a tourist area in egypt these days you have to go through a checkpoint to get into the tourist zone , ” he said . “ it 's only once past this cordon that you can move freely .
but it 's not so much that tourists are traveling into a dangerous situation , rather they are taking their fear from home with them . " for khaula saleh , an arab journalist living in germany , the idea of packing tourists into gated communities is also not the answer .
" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .

almost 53 percent of the island of 397,000 voted in favor of membership in the european union , an outcome that was anything but secure in the days leading up to saturday 's vote . the referendum , though non-binding , was seen as an important indicator of support for the eu course the government of prime minister eddie fenech ami and his conservative nationalist party has been taking .
the opposition labour party had campaigned heavily against entry , concerned that it would take away malta 's cherished neutrality and flood the island with property-buying europeans . some polls leading up to saturday 's referendum indicated that almost 60 percent of the population shared labour 's anti-eu stance . but the " yes " campaign run by the nationalist party won out .
a party source told the malta independent newspaper that the margin of victory was between 20,000 and 30,000 votes .
an estimated 91 percent of the 292,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum .
the eu declared malta a candidate for entry during a conference in copenhagen last december .
the nation is expected to join the eu with nine other countries in 2004 .
eight of the remaining nine countries will hold referendums this year , with slovenia holding the next vote on march 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political bickering mars malta 's eu vote the citizens of the island of malta go to the polls saturday to tell their government what they think of their country 's possible eu entry .

almost 53 percent of the island of 397,000 voted in favor of membership in the european union , an outcome that was anything but secure in the days leading up to saturday 's vote . the referendum , though non-binding , was seen as an important indicator of support for the eu course the government of prime minister eddie fenech ami and his conservative nationalist party has been taking .
the opposition labour party had campaigned heavily against entry , concerned that it would take away malta 's cherished neutrality and flood the island with property-buying europeans . some polls leading up to saturday 's referendum indicated that almost 60 percent of the population shared labour 's anti-eu stance . but the " yes " campaign run by the nationalist party won out .
a party source told the malta independent newspaper that the margin of victory was between 20,000 and 30,000 votes .
an estimated 91 percent of the 292,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum .
the eu declared malta a candidate for entry during a conference in copenhagen last december .
the nation is expected to join the eu with nine other countries in 2004 .
eight of the remaining nine countries will hold referendums this year , with slovenia holding the next vote on march 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political bickering mars malta 's eu vote the citizens of the island of malta go to the polls saturday to tell their government what they think of their country 's possible eu entry .

but at home , it is a different story .
in particular , many smaller bakers are facing ruin – even though the average german chews his or her way through seven rolls , nearly 30 slices of bread , and a heap of cakes and pastries every week .
take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .
" that 's why they come to small stores . " sürth 's sales have risen a bit over the past few weeks , but the jump has n't turned him into an optimist .
" there 'll be fewer and fewer small bakers left because the big boys will push them out .
i can even see a time when there are none left at all .
that 'll be a pity . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german shopping trend mixes the great with the small radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .

" when you travel to a tourist area in egypt these days you have to go through a checkpoint to get into the tourist zone , ” he said . “ it 's only once past this cordon that you can move freely .
but it 's not so much that tourists are traveling into a dangerous situation , rather they are taking their fear from home with them . " for khaula saleh , an arab journalist living in germany , the idea of packing tourists into gated communities is also not the answer .
" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .

but at home , it is a different story .
in particular , many smaller bakers are facing ruin – even though the average german chews his or her way through seven rolls , nearly 30 slices of bread , and a heap of cakes and pastries every week .
take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .
" that 's why they come to small stores . " sürth 's sales have risen a bit over the past few weeks , but the jump has n't turned him into an optimist .
" there 'll be fewer and fewer small bakers left because the big boys will push them out .
i can even see a time when there are none left at all .
that 'll be a pity . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german shopping trend mixes the great with the small radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

almost 53 percent of the island of 397,000 voted in favor of membership in the european union , an outcome that was anything but secure in the days leading up to saturday 's vote . the referendum , though non-binding , was seen as an important indicator of support for the eu course the government of prime minister eddie fenech ami and his conservative nationalist party has been taking .
the opposition labour party had campaigned heavily against entry , concerned that it would take away malta 's cherished neutrality and flood the island with property-buying europeans . some polls leading up to saturday 's referendum indicated that almost 60 percent of the population shared labour 's anti-eu stance . but the " yes " campaign run by the nationalist party won out .
a party source told the malta independent newspaper that the margin of victory was between 20,000 and 30,000 votes .
an estimated 91 percent of the 292,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum .
the eu declared malta a candidate for entry during a conference in copenhagen last december .

almost 53 percent of the island of 397,000 voted in favor of membership in the european union , an outcome that was anything but secure in the days leading up to saturday 's vote . the referendum , though non-binding , was seen as an important indicator of support for the eu course the government of prime minister eddie fenech ami and his conservative nationalist party has been taking .
the opposition labour party had campaigned heavily against entry , concerned that it would take away malta 's cherished neutrality and flood the island with property-buying europeans . some polls leading up to saturday 's referendum indicated that almost 60 percent of the population shared labour 's anti-eu stance . but the " yes " campaign run by the nationalist party won out .
a party source told the malta independent newspaper that the margin of victory was between 20,000 and 30,000 votes .
an estimated 91 percent of the 292,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum .
the eu declared malta a candidate for entry during a conference in copenhagen last december .

but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .
increasingly tourists will choose to vacation in high security complexes , he said , akin to the gated holiday villages prevalent nowadays in caribbean hotspots like st. lucia and barbados . " when you travel to a tourist area in egypt these days you have to go through a checkpoint to get into the tourist zone , ” he said . “ it 's only once past this cordon that you can move freely .
but it 's not so much that tourists are traveling into a dangerous situation , rather they are taking their fear from home with them . " for khaula saleh , an arab journalist living in germany , the idea of packing tourists into gated communities is also not the answer .
" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .

in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .

in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states .

take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .
" that 's why they come to small stores . " sürth 's sales have risen a bit over the past few weeks , but the jump has n't turned him into an optimist .
" there 'll be fewer and fewer small bakers left because the big boys will push them out .
i can even see a time when there are none left at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .
and they are planning an effort to curb losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .
and they are planning an effort to curb losses .

but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .
increasingly tourists will choose to vacation in high security complexes , he said , akin to the gated holiday villages prevalent nowadays in caribbean hotspots like st. lucia and barbados .

" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .

but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .
increasingly tourists will choose to vacation in high security complexes , he said , akin to the gated holiday villages prevalent nowadays in caribbean hotspots like st. lucia and barbados . " when you travel to a tourist area in egypt these days you have to go through a checkpoint to get into the tourist zone , ” he said . “ it 's only once past this cordon that you can move freely .
but it 's not so much that tourists are traveling into a dangerous situation , rather they are taking their fear from home with them . " for khaula saleh , an arab journalist living in germany , the idea of packing tourists into gated communities is also not the answer .
" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .

but at home , it is a different story .
in particular , many smaller bakers are facing ruin – even though the average german chews his or her way through seven rolls , nearly 30 slices of bread , and a heap of cakes and pastries every week .
take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .
" that 's why they come to small stores . " sürth 's sales have risen a bit over the past few weeks , but the jump has n't turned him into an optimist .
" there 'll be fewer and fewer small bakers left because the big boys will push them out .
i can even see a time when there are none left at all .
that 'll be a pity . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german shopping trend mixes the great with the small 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

by evening , the stock had fallen 9.6 percent to € 9.15 -lrb- $ 10.09 -rrb- . europe 's biggest ever annual corporate loss came mainly from asset write-downs and charges totaling € 19.3 billion .
many of the companies that deutsche telekom acquired during the bullish 1990s were overpriced , and poor performance has meant their value has fallen sharply . core earnings in the fourth quarter also exceeded expectations , rising 14.6 percent to € 4.4 billion , and cuts to overall debt topped analysts ' forecasts as well .
income from fixed-line services is picking up again , and telekom 's cell-phone division , t-mobile , says it is optimistic its results this year will continue the upward trend started in the last part of 2002 . a turn for the better the turn-around in the company 's fortunes came after a year dogged by falling share prices and a bruising boardroom battle to oust long-term telekom boss ron sommer . the fallout from the fight to head the company has also led to a rash of personnel changes at the top .
the company 's new chief executive , kai-uwe ricke , still has a lot to do to turn the company around for good .
in particular , he has to do more to slash its mountain of debt , which analysts say reached € 61 billion last year . deutsche telekom hopes the continuing fall of the dollar against the euro will also help it to cut at least € 11 billion from that total by the end of 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ricke is new deutsche telekom boss deutsche telekom still behind in confidence stakes telekom appointment answers the 28 billion euro question 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .

in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .

almost 53 percent of the island of 397,000 voted in favor of membership in the european union , an outcome that was anything but secure in the days leading up to saturday 's vote . the referendum , though non-binding , was seen as an important indicator of support for the eu course the government of prime minister eddie fenech ami and his conservative nationalist party has been taking .
the opposition labour party had campaigned heavily against entry , concerned that it would take away malta 's cherished neutrality and flood the island with property-buying europeans . some polls leading up to saturday 's referendum indicated that almost 60 percent of the population shared labour 's anti-eu stance . but the " yes " campaign run by the nationalist party won out .
a party source told the malta independent newspaper that the margin of victory was between 20,000 and 30,000 votes .
an estimated 91 percent of the 292,000 eligible voters turned out for the referendum .
the eu declared malta a candidate for entry during a conference in copenhagen last december .
the nation is expected to join the eu with nine other countries in 2004 .
eight of the remaining nine countries will hold referendums this year , with slovenia holding the next vote on march 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political bickering mars malta 's eu vote the citizens of the island of malta go to the polls saturday to tell their government what they think of their country 's possible eu entry .
but the results could spell the beginning of the end for the pro-eu government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 the rise and fall of the german loaf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last refuge of the old-style german baker faced with competition on an industrial scale and a dwindling customer base , germany 's traditional bakers could soon become a thing of the past . bakers are among germany 's most popular ambassadors : german bakers can be found all over the world , and they are doing very nicely , thank you .
but at home , it is a different story .
in particular , many smaller bakers are facing ruin – even though the average german chews his or her way through seven rolls , nearly 30 slices of bread , and a heap of cakes and pastries every week .
take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .

take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .

but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .
increasingly tourists will choose to vacation in high security complexes , he said , akin to the gated holiday villages prevalent nowadays in caribbean hotspots like st. lucia and barbados . " when you travel to a tourist area in egypt these days you have to go through a checkpoint to get into the tourist zone , ” he said . “ it 's only once past this cordon that you can move freely .
but it 's not so much that tourists are traveling into a dangerous situation , rather they are taking their fear from home with them . " for khaula saleh , an arab journalist living in germany , the idea of packing tourists into gated communities is also not the answer .
" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .

anti-war protesters celebrated in the streets of the turkish capital ankara . in a surprise upset on saturday , turkey 's parliament decided not to allow u.s. troops to be stationed in the country in the event of an iraq war .
while 264 parliamentarians voted in favor of turkey functioning as a springboard for a u.s. offensive , 251 were opposed and 19 abstained . immediately after the vote reports were disseminated that the proposal had passed .
but parliamentary president bülent arinc later announced that it had actually failed because a majority of the parliamentarians present - 267 - had not voted in favor . the u.s. put pressure on turkey , a nato member country , to allow it to station 62,000 troops , 255 airplanes and 65 helicopters in the country .

political observers speculated that the delay was caused by the government trying to ensure the proposal would be approved in parliament .
approval would also have sent turkish troops to northern iraq in the event of a war .
the government said they would be needed there both to prevent a refugee crisis and the creation of a kurdish state .
turkey fears that fighting in the region may re-ignite the kurdish conflict in turkey 's southeast .
prime minister abdullah gül , however , said on saturday that the country has a critical period ahead of it .
the government will examine what economic and political steps need to be taken , he announced .
gül said that the decision had not harmed u.s.-turkish relations , which " are safe in friendship and mutual understanding . "
another vote on the proposal to station u.s. troops in turkey is possible at a later date .
u.s. military circles reported that washington could quickly change its plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .

by evening , the stock had fallen 9.6 percent to € 9.15 -lrb- $ 10.09 -rrb- . europe 's biggest ever annual corporate loss came mainly from asset write-downs and charges totaling € 19.3 billion .
many of the companies that deutsche telekom acquired during the bullish 1990s were overpriced , and poor performance has meant their value has fallen sharply . core earnings in the fourth quarter also exceeded expectations , rising 14.6 percent to € 4.4 billion , and cuts to overall debt topped analysts ' forecasts as well .
income from fixed-line services is picking up again , and telekom 's cell-phone division , t-mobile , says it is optimistic its results this year will continue the upward trend started in the last part of 2002 . a turn for the better the turn-around in the company 's fortunes came after a year dogged by falling share prices and a bruising boardroom battle to oust long-term telekom boss ron sommer . the fallout from the fight to head the company has also led to a rash of personnel changes at the top .
the company 's new chief executive , kai-uwe ricke , still has a lot to do to turn the company around for good .
in particular , he has to do more to slash its mountain of debt , which analysts say reached € 61 billion last year . deutsche telekom hopes the continuing fall of the dollar against the euro will also help it to cut at least € 11 billion from that total by the end of 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ricke is new deutsche telekom boss deutsche telekom still behind in confidence stakes telekom appointment answers the 28 billion euro question 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .

in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states .

the government said they would be needed there both to prevent a refugee crisis and the creation of a kurdish state .
turkey fears that fighting in the region may re-ignite the kurdish conflict in turkey 's southeast .
prime minister abdullah gül , however , said on saturday that the country has a critical period ahead of it .
the government will examine what economic and political steps need to be taken , he announced .
gül said that the decision had not harmed u.s.-turkish relations , which " are safe in friendship and mutual understanding . "
another vote on the proposal to station u.s. troops in turkey is possible at a later date .
u.s. military circles reported that washington could quickly change its plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 the rise and fall of the german loaf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last refuge of the old-style german baker faced with competition on an industrial scale and a dwindling customer base , germany 's traditional bakers could soon become a thing of the past . bakers are among germany 's most popular ambassadors : german bakers can be found all over the world , and they are doing very nicely , thank you .
but at home , it is a different story .
in particular , many smaller bakers are facing ruin – even though the average german chews his or her way through seven rolls , nearly 30 slices of bread , and a heap of cakes and pastries every week .
take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .
" that 's why they come to small stores . " sürth 's sales have risen a bit over the past few weeks , but the jump has n't turned him into an optimist .
" there 'll be fewer and fewer small bakers left because the big boys will push them out .
i can even see a time when there are none left at all .
that 'll be a pity . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german shopping trend mixes the great with the small 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
anton börner , who heads a leading german business group , the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , has said he fears the dispute between berlin and washington could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a recent statement .
" increased unease " indeed , with 10.3 percent of all german exports going to the u.s. , the stakes are high .
and many companies are already under increasing pressure from their american clients .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " german foreign trade federation spokesman andré schwarz recently told dw-world .
though none of germany 's blue chip companies - including daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens - have reported any problems yet , schwarz told dw-world that many companies were already feeling the chill .
schwarz did not want to identify any of the companies that have complained because of their reluctance to go public .
" they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives , " he said . and that 's a step one american company has already decided to take .
in an e-mail to dw-world sent late wednesday evening , farrar added : " i can not in good conscience support the german economy , even in our own very small way , while at the same time the german government shows a lack of support for the united states . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de companies fear americans wo n't buy german as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .

but at home , it is a different story .
in particular , many smaller bakers are facing ruin – even though the average german chews his or her way through seven rolls , nearly 30 slices of bread , and a heap of cakes and pastries every week .
take zimmermann 's bakery in cologne .
it is easy to find : all you have to do is go into the city center and follow your nose .
a glance at the display of fruit loaves , giant pretzels , nut cake , onion rolls and dozens of other examples of the baker 's art is enough to make your mouth water .
that is hardly surprising : the zimmermann family has been making bread and cakes since 1875 .
how long that will continue is an open question .
the store 's owner , markus zimmermann , says family businesses like his are now rare in germany .
" it 's a pity , but most of the small bakeries … have disappeared , " he sighs .
" let me tell you , if you have a small business in one of these back streets , it 's hard , very hard . " an endangered species bakers have existed in germany for more than 1,000 years .
just 15 years ago , there were 30,000 independent bakers in germany .
but peter susbauer from the german bakers ' association estimates that between 700 and 800 small family concerns are swallowed up by larger companies every year .
" you end up with chains with 20 to 30 outlets – or even a bakery like kamps , which has 1,000 , " he says .
" that naturally leads to a certain uniformity . "
bakers such as dieter sürth , who has a single store in a cologne suburb , are now having to fight for survival .
although he is sick , he is still at the bakery .
he says it takes more than a cold or the ' flu to keep him at home , but he does not have much choice anyway .
last year , his sales dropped by 30 percent and he ended up making a five-figure loss . big is beautiful it is the same throughout the trade .
recession has made germans less willing to splurge on hand-made cookies or cakes .
even more important , supermarkets and bakery chains tend to buy mass-produced deep-frozen bread : all the staff there has to do is stick it in the computer-regulated oven and wait a few minutes .
bakers like sürth just can not compete with these economies of scale .
another reason factory-made bakery products have become so popular is that their quality is constantly improving .
the big companies spend a lot fine-tuning their products to the customers ' tastes .
the lone baker has to rely on his own instincts . the personal touch sürth says he can only get that through personal contact with his customers .
" for them , it 's important to be spoken to properly and to be given the right advice , " he says .
" that 's why they come to small stores . " sürth 's sales have risen a bit over the past few weeks , but the jump has n't turned him into an optimist .
" there 'll be fewer and fewer small bakers left because the big boys will push them out .

but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .
increasingly tourists will choose to vacation in high security complexes , he said , akin to the gated holiday villages prevalent nowadays in caribbean hotspots like st. lucia and barbados . " when you travel to a tourist area in egypt these days you have to go through a checkpoint to get into the tourist zone , ” he said . “ it 's only once past this cordon that you can move freely .
but it 's not so much that tourists are traveling into a dangerous situation , rather they are taking their fear from home with them . " for khaula saleh , an arab journalist living in germany , the idea of packing tourists into gated communities is also not the answer .
" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .

but german travel experts say gated villages are not the answer . as the international tourism fair closes on tuesday in berlin , the global travel industry - worth $ 460 billion globally - is facing gloomy times .
with the rumblings of a u.s.-led war against iraq getting ever closer , travel companies like tui and thomas cook are reporting that vacation bookings by germans - one of the best traveled nations in the world - are down 10 percent .
middle east destinations are the most affected . with 11 countries on the german foreign ministry 's " no-go " list and the memory of the 14 german tourists killed in a terrorist bomb attack on a synagogue in tunisia last april still fresh in german holidaymakers ' minds , tourists questioned in a recent survey said security was their number one priority .
but travel experts at a discussion forum at the itb said that pandering to tourist paranoia and herding travelers into gated holiday villages were not the way to lift the tourist industry out of its current depression . gated holiday complexes trap tourists karl bonn , a german professor of travel management , said tourists ' fear of terrorist attack was a worrying development , believing the era of wanderlust and exploratory travel were now a thing of the past .
increasingly tourists will choose to vacation in high security complexes , he said , akin to the gated holiday villages prevalent nowadays in caribbean hotspots like st. lucia and barbados . " when you travel to a tourist area in egypt these days you have to go through a checkpoint to get into the tourist zone , ” he said . “ it 's only once past this cordon that you can move freely .
but it 's not so much that tourists are traveling into a dangerous situation , rather they are taking their fear from home with them . " for khaula saleh , an arab journalist living in germany , the idea of packing tourists into gated communities is also not the answer .
" believe me , if vacationers were more integrated into the places where they were staying , it would n't be so easy for terrorists to launch attacks on them , " she said . bonn acknowledged that tourists were a prime target for attacks by politically motivated terrorists who want to achieve as much media exposure as possible .
and the head of the german tourism industry association , klaus laepple , acknowledged that there were some places in the world that were definitely safer than others . " we ca n't just sit back any more and divide up the world into good and evil , safe and unsafe .
but we must keep an eye on developments in certain areas and keep our customers abreast of them .
the safety of our travelers is our number one priority , " he said at the forum . all who took part in the discussion agreed on one thing : there is no one place in the world where tourist security is absolutely assured . but for one section of the community , staying closer to home might be an attractive alternative .
klaus wowereit , berlin 's openly gay mayor , was at the itb marketing berlin as a top gay destination .

anti-war protesters celebrated in the streets of the turkish capital ankara . in a surprise upset on saturday , turkey 's parliament decided not to allow u.s. troops to be stationed in the country in the event of an iraq war .
while 264 parliamentarians voted in favor of turkey functioning as a springboard for a u.s. offensive , 251 were opposed and 19 abstained . immediately after the vote reports were disseminated that the proposal had passed .
but parliamentary president bülent arinc later announced that it had actually failed because a majority of the parliamentarians present - 267 - had not voted in favor . the u.s. put pressure on turkey , a nato member country , to allow it to station 62,000 troops , 255 airplanes and 65 helicopters in the country .

turkey fears that fighting in the region may re-ignite the kurdish conflict in turkey 's southeast .
prime minister abdullah gül , however , said on saturday that the country has a critical period ahead of it .
the government will examine what economic and political steps need to be taken , he announced .
gül said that the decision had not harmed u.s.-turkish relations , which " are safe in friendship and mutual understanding . "
another vote on the proposal to station u.s. troops in turkey is possible at a later date .
u.s. military circles reported that washington could quickly change its plans .

by evening , the stock had fallen 9.6 percent to € 9.15 -lrb- $ 10.09 -rrb- . europe 's biggest ever annual corporate loss came mainly from asset write-downs and charges totaling € 19.3 billion .
many of the companies that deutsche telekom acquired during the bullish 1990s were overpriced , and poor performance has meant their value has fallen sharply . core earnings in the fourth quarter also exceeded expectations , rising 14.6 percent to € 4.4 billion , and cuts to overall debt topped analysts ' forecasts as well .
income from fixed-line services is picking up again , and telekom 's cell-phone division , t-mobile , says it is optimistic its results this year will continue the upward trend started in the last part of 2002 . a turn for the better the turn-around in the company 's fortunes came after a year dogged by falling share prices and a bruising boardroom battle to oust long-term telekom boss ron sommer . the fallout from the fight to head the company has also led to a rash of personnel changes at the top .
the company 's new chief executive , kai-uwe ricke , still has a lot to do to turn the company around for good .
in particular , he has to do more to slash its mountain of debt , which analysts say reached € 61 billion last year . deutsche telekom hopes the continuing fall of the dollar against the euro will also help it to cut at least € 11 billion from that total by the end of 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ricke is new deutsche telekom boss deutsche telekom still behind in confidence stakes telekom appointment answers the 28 billion euro question 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.03.2003 american company boycotts germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supplier lederett yields its business to american companies .
in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .

in the first recorded case of its kind , an american company says it has canceled orders from a german company , citing germany 's refusal to support a possible u.s.-led war against iraq . ever since chancellor gerhard schröder first uttered the words " no " to a war against iraq on the campaign trail , german business executives have been publicly agitated by political tensions between berlin and washington .
they fear germany 's anti-war stance could have a damaging ripple effect on german manufacturers ' sales in the united states , their biggest export market outside the european union .
now , those fears have become a reality - at least for one small company in economically beleaguered eastern germany .
in an open letter to schröder that was obtained by dw-world on wednesday , a shoe supply manufacturer based in siebenlehn reported it had lost a lucrative contract with an american company because of germany 's anti-war stance .
though lederett will only lose an estimated € 48,000 -lrb- $ 52,651 -rrb- a year in revenues from the cancellation of orders from enefco international of auburn , maine , the symbolic meaning goes beyond numbers .
a tough contract to win in her letter , lederett chief grit kuhnt said her 46-employee company had fought for two years to become a leatherboard supplier for enefco international , a manufacturer of footwear supplies and contract cutting and packaging .
ninety percent of lederett 's business in sales of products including shoe heels and insoles comes from exports , kuhnt wrote .
kuhnt also pleaded with schröder to " take steps to protect german industry and to modify its anti-war policy vis-a-vis iraq so that our american friends can be certain that the federal government is n't going to sacrifice american friendships that have been built over many years on the alter of short-term domestic political gain . "
" we do n't know how many german companies have had to undergo similar experiences , " kuhnt added , " but we are certain that the federal government would react if , for example , the automobile industry were affected in this way . "
she also called on schröder to personally intervene in the matter .
but as of wednesday , she had not yet received a response from the government .
buying american lederett first learned it had lost its business with enefco on feb .
18 .
in a letter to lederett 's u.s. office , enefco president norman farrar said the firm would no longer purchase products from the company for the " foreseeable future " because of the " lack of support for the u.s. by the federal republic of germany . "
farrar said he had been " very pleased " with the quality , service and price provided by lederett , but " because of the current political situation i feel it necessary to strengthen u.s.-based industry and purchase locally , even at a slightly increased cost . "
farrar said he hoped for a change in the political climate in germany so that he could " once again feel comfortable using lederett material . "
the american chamber of commerce in germany , a trans-atlantic trade association with 3,000 members in the united states and germany , said on wednesday this was the first time on record an american company has boycotted a german company over berlin 's anti-war stance .
" we hope it stays that way , " spokeswoman patricia limburg told dw-world .
german businesses rally to prevent boycott in recent weeks , german business and community leaders have undertaken efforts to prevent the kind of boycott that has hit lederett .
the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- organization recently took out a full-page ad in the new york times and in the german newspaper die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praised the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " it said .
