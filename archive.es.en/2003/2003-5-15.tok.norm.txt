u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .
in putting resources into the military rather fighting poverty , working toward social injustice or protecting the environment , also lays the foundation for new military confrontations , the bicc says . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global defense spending surges in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 15.05.2003 transatlantic divide : germany 's rift wth america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house and berlin are n't this close anymore .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .
and schröder had to sit back and listen as his country was named in the same breath as the dictatorships which rule cuba and libya . although france has topped germany as primary target for washington 's ire , u.s.-german relations have not improved , at least not at government level .
opposition politicians such as cdu leader angela merkel are openly received in washington , and defense minister peter struck and some deputies were were received well at a recent nato summit in washington .
but for the time being at least , the telephone line between schröder and bush remains conspicuously dead . klaus dahmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .

while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .
in putting resources into the military rather fighting poverty , working toward social injustice or protecting the environment , also lays the foundation for new military confrontations , the bicc says . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global defense spending surges in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .
in putting resources into the military rather fighting poverty , working toward social injustice or protecting the environment , also lays the foundation for new military confrontations , the bicc says . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global defense spending surges in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 15.05.2003 transatlantic divide : germany 's rift wth america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house and berlin are n't this close anymore .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .
and schröder had to sit back and listen as his country was named in the same breath as the dictatorships which rule cuba and libya . although france has topped germany as primary target for washington 's ire , u.s.-german relations have not improved , at least not at government level .
opposition politicians such as cdu leader angela merkel are openly received in washington , and defense minister peter struck and some deputies were were received well at a recent nato summit in washington .
but for the time being at least , the telephone line between schröder and bush remains conspicuously dead . klaus dahmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .
in putting resources into the military rather fighting poverty , working toward social injustice or protecting the environment , also lays the foundation for new military confrontations , the bicc says . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global defense spending surges in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .
in putting resources into the military rather fighting poverty , working toward social injustice or protecting the environment , also lays the foundation for new military confrontations , the bicc says . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global defense spending surges in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 15.05.2003 transatlantic divide : germany 's rift wth america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house and berlin are n't this close anymore .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .
and schröder had to sit back and listen as his country was named in the same breath as the dictatorships which rule cuba and libya . although france has topped germany as primary target for washington 's ire , u.s.-german relations have not improved , at least not at government level .
opposition politicians such as cdu leader angela merkel are openly received in washington , and defense minister peter struck and some deputies were were received well at a recent nato summit in washington .
but for the time being at least , the telephone line between schröder and bush remains conspicuously dead . klaus dahmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .

fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the powell visit schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy opinion : has the transatlantic ice age ended ?
boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 15.05.2003 transatlantic divide : germany 's rift wth america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house and berlin are n't this close anymore .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 15.05.2003 transatlantic divide : germany 's rift wth america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house and berlin are n't this close anymore .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .
in putting resources into the military rather fighting poverty , working toward social injustice or protecting the environment , also lays the foundation for new military confrontations , the bicc says . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global defense spending surges in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 15.05.2003 transatlantic divide : germany 's rift wth america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house and berlin are n't this close anymore .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .
and schröder had to sit back and listen as his country was named in the same breath as the dictatorships which rule cuba and libya . although france has topped germany as primary target for washington 's ire , u.s.-german relations have not improved , at least not at government level .
opposition politicians such as cdu leader angela merkel are openly received in washington , and defense minister peter struck and some deputies were were received well at a recent nato summit in washington .
but for the time being at least , the telephone line between schröder and bush remains conspicuously dead . klaus dahmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .
and schröder had to sit back and listen as his country was named in the same breath as the dictatorships which rule cuba and libya . although france has topped germany as primary target for washington 's ire , u.s.-german relations have not improved , at least not at government level .
opposition politicians such as cdu leader angela merkel are openly received in washington , and defense minister peter struck and some deputies were were received well at a recent nato summit in washington .
but for the time being at least , the telephone line between schröder and bush remains conspicuously dead . klaus dahmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .
in putting resources into the military rather fighting poverty , working toward social injustice or protecting the environment , also lays the foundation for new military confrontations , the bicc says . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global defense spending surges in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s .

u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .
and schröder had to sit back and listen as his country was named in the same breath as the dictatorships which rule cuba and libya . although france has topped germany as primary target for washington 's ire , u.s.-german relations have not improved , at least not at government level .
opposition politicians such as cdu leader angela merkel are openly received in washington , and defense minister peter struck and some deputies were were received well at a recent nato summit in washington .
but for the time being at least , the telephone line between schröder and bush remains conspicuously dead . klaus dahmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 15.05.2003 transatlantic divide : germany 's rift wth america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house and berlin are n't this close anymore .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .
and schröder had to sit back and listen as his country was named in the same breath as the dictatorships which rule cuba and libya . although france has topped germany as primary target for washington 's ire , u.s.-german relations have not improved , at least not at government level .
opposition politicians such as cdu leader angela merkel are openly received in washington , and defense minister peter struck and some deputies were were received well at a recent nato summit in washington .
but for the time being at least , the telephone line between schröder and bush remains conspicuously dead . klaus dahmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .
in putting resources into the military rather fighting poverty , working toward social injustice or protecting the environment , also lays the foundation for new military confrontations , the bicc says . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global defense spending surges in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s .

u.s. policy toward conflict resolution and increased military spending is making the world more dangerous rather than safer , a recent study out of bonn says . the actions of the u.s. over the past year could lead to a renewed global arms race , according to the bonn international conversion center , an independent nonprofit agency that works to convert military resources for civilian purposes .
kerstin müller , state secretary of the german foreign ministry , says the bicc results to support the position of the current government .
berlin agrees with washington on the need to fight against world terrorism , she says .
however , " we are convinced that the solution to future conflicts are to be found in the framework of bilateral structures ...
arms races ca n't and should n't be the solution for the future . "
fighting poverty is key the bicc report concludes that as long as the fight against poverty is n't more decisively fought , the world ca n't be made more secure .
while recent united nations conferences in monterrey and johannesburg show that the fight against poverty has taken a more important place in world politics , diplomatic efforts ca n't keep up with the growing military spending .
in 2002 military spending worldwide grew to $ 900 million -lrb- € 782 million -rrb- .
the lion 's share of that spending was done in the u.s. , the report says .
michael brzoska , head of research at bicc , notes that the us has increased its portion of worldwide military spending to nearly 40 % , and that their defense spending rose by nearly 13 percent in 2002 .
russia and china also spent more on armaments - although , with their share of world-wide military spending at 4 and 5 percent respectively , it is relatively low , brzoska says " markedly lower than that of the united states , in any case . "
many other countries have n't followed this trend of military spending .
altogether in 2001 , 42 countries lowered their military spending , the report says .
us has largest arms industry " altogether , the -lrb- division -rrb- between military spending of the u.s.a. and the rest of the world is ever larger , " brzoska says .
as for defense research-and-development spending , the u.s. share is up to two-thirds , the report says .
bicc measures the state of worldwide disarmament using various indicators - for example , it looks at what role the defense industry plays in a given country 's economy .
the number of people worldwide working in the arms industry fell in 2001 by 2.5 percent to about seven million people , mostly due to reductions in china , the report says .
still , china , with 2.5 million employed , is the country with the most people working in arms production .
but in the usa there are about 2.3 million employed in the arms industry , and this number is increasing .
" it is possible that the u.s.a. in the near future will be the country with the most people employed in the arms industry worldwide , " brzoska says .
in the united states , there are three people employed in the arms industry for every two soldiers , according to the report .
of the 100 biggest arms makers , the bicc said , 42 had their headquarters in the united states .
rise in high-tech weaponry the number of soldiers worldwide , as well as the number of heavy armaments , fell last year , according to bicc .
while this sounds good , brzoska notes however that it is n't necessarily a positive development .
" armies replace older weapons with fewer newer , technologically advanced weapons , so that the reduction in the number of heavy arms does n't actually represent a qualitative disarmament , " brzoska says .
giving equal weight to military spending , arms-industry employment , the number of soldiers and the number of heavy arms , the u.s. portion of the worldwide armament is around 22 % .
following the united states comes china at 15 % and russia with some 7 % .
brzoska is critical of the us roll , saying the us has relatively few soldiers , around 1.5 million , and a relatively low number of heavy arms , but " they put their bets on high technology , " he says .
the u.s. spends around 21,000 per soldier - about eight times more than the worldwide average .
from this growing u.s. technical superiority , a new military strategy is developing , the report says .
in it , the usa meets real or imagined threats , to itself of its allies , with technological armament .
this course of action is " problematic , " according to brzoska , as it could lead to a world-wide arms race .

boycott of europe loses steam germany -pipe- 15.05.2003 " germany put its foreign policy in the hands of the french " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke says a role for germany in postwar iraq would be " desirable . "
a former clinton official says germany made a bad move by aligning with france against the war in iraq , thus undoing 50 years of successful policy .
he also offers a road map to reconciliation . on the eve of united states secretary of state colin powell 's official visit to berlin , dw-radio interviewed the former u.s. ambassador to the united nations , richard holbrooke , who served in that role under former president bill clinton .
in the broad conversation , holbrooke discusses frayed relations between german chancellor gerhard schröder , who staunchly opposed the war against iraq in concert with the french , and u.s. president george w. bush and offers some pointers to get the ball rolling again between the traditionally strong transatlantic allies .
mr. holbrooke , there 's talk of a meeting between bush and schröder on the sidelines of the g8 summit in france .
do you think the two of them will be able to set aside their differences if they meet ?
first of all , such a meeting is essential .
if they go to evian and they do n't have a meeting , that in itself would the worst possible signal .
secondly , they do n't like each other .
they 've made that quite apparent publicly , but they each represent great nations and they must rise above their personal distastes and get back to mutually satisfactory relationships because it 's in the national interest of both the united states and germany for them to do so .
if two leaders do n't like each other , how difficult does that make it for their officials to ease the diplomacy between their countries ?
it makes it much more difficult .
i 've encountered several experiences in my career in the state department and other places where heads of government really did n't get along .
but good diplomats - in this case foreign ministers powell and -lrb- joschka -rrb- fischer - have to soften the tensions .
on the other hand , good personal relationships on high levels can create historic opportunities , like president -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush and -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin .
so it 's very important that they overcome their personal animosity and think in terms of the national interest of the u.s. and germany .
what in your opinion could chancellor gerhard schröder do to regain favor in america 's eye without actually compromising his position ?
i think both the u.s. and germany have to pull back from the very bad behavior that has resulted in recent times .
the germans need to recognize in my view that - and i speak as a friend of germany and a former ambassador , as somebody who has great affection for the german people and for what they 've achieved in recent years - germany must rethink its foreign policy .
in recent months , it put its own foreign policy in the hands of the french .
that was neither historically justifiable nor politically smart .
why do they need to do that ?
germany has been most successful in its foreign policy when it follows , as it has for the past 50 years , a policy of getting along with both washington and paris - even when the two countries are not getting along with each other .
by giving paris essentially a blank check in the dispute over iraq , they compromised their own national interests .
so , it 's time for germany to rethink that and move back to its traditional 50-year policy from -lrb- former chancellor konrad -rrb- adenauer on that was so successful .
as for the united states , we should not get in a position where we mete out pluses and minuses , merit and demerit badges as if we were the world 's judge .
we had a serious disagreement with germany .
but even while we had that disagreement over iraq , germany provided security for the american bases in germany , freeing up over 3,000 troops for iraqi combat , germany was taking a leadership role in afghanistan , in bosnia and kosovo , and germany remains our indispensable european continental ally .
and we need to remember all that and put it into perspective and get this horrible period we 've had behind us .
the best way to do that in my view is for germany to get involved in the post-saddam reconstruction of iraq .
i would love to see that because germany has played an important role in bosnia and kosovo and afghanistan .
you say you 'd love to see germany getting involved .
do you think it will be invited to do so ?
that 's up to secretary powell and chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer .
all i 'm telling you is what i , as a private citizen , think would be desirable .
chancellor schröder has made it clear he would also like to see greater united nations involvement in postwar iraq .
do you think we might see some concessions along these lines ?
i ca n't speak for the administration , but i think chancellor schröder is correct in saying the un has an important role to play .
the united states and britain have effectively sidelined the u.n. recently , have n't they , in not getting backing for the resolution to go to war on iraq and now they 're deciding how best to administer iraq .
does n't that leave the un looking pretty powerless and set a rather dangerous precedent ?
let 's remember , first of all , that the un is not an independent organization .
it is simply a bureaucracy that carries out the instructions , the mandate of the security council .
so when you say the un has sidelined itself , that is n't quite right .
the un has been sidelined by the dispute between the u.s. , france , russia , germany and the u.k. and that needs to be overcome , but the un has a very valuable role to play in iraq - not in security .
security has got to remain in the hands of the coalition that liberated the country from saddam 's tyranny .
and by the way , i think all americans and all germans , whether they supported the war or not , should recognize that the iraqi people are much better off without saddam than with him .
but on the issue you raised , humanitarian assistance and post-saddam governance , the un has a vital and valuable role to play and it happens - whether washington agrees with this or not - to be in the u.s. interest for that to take place . interview conducted by charlotte collins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit a complete dw-world dossier on the first visit of an american cabinet official since the end of the war against iraq with background on transatlantic tensions and daily reports .

u.s. secretary of state colin powell will arrive friday in berlin in what many are seeing as a chance to repair damaged relations between the two countries .
a chronology on how it came to be that way . " i have pledged germany 's unrestricted solidarity to u.s. president george bush , " were the words used by chancellor gerhard schröder following the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 .
back then , when german-american relations were still nicely intact , there was much talk in berlin about " unrestricted solidarity " towards the u.s. and relations between the two nations were still blossoming at the end of january 2002 , when the german chancellor visited george bush at the white house . just a short while earlier , bush had spoken about the ' axis of evil ' which was threatening world peace , and pointedly cited north korea , iran and iraq .
it was a statement which likely caused some consternation within the ranks of the german government , but schröder remained cool . even when the u.s. threats against baghdad became more serious , and the first signs of dissent began to appear in germany , the chancellor stood squarely behind the american leader , telling the german public " to exert pressure on iraq and the iraqi government of saddam hussein , is the right thing to do if he is to fulfill what the united nations expects of him . " warm words turn icy schröder was keen not to rock the boat , even when the u.s. president visited berlin at the end of may to outline his position .
following bush 's speech in the lower house of the german parliament , the bundestag , schröder believed he had witnessed a " truly meaningful speech , " which utterly disproved the much-nurtured prejudices harbored towards us politics and the president himself . but the warm words succumbed to an icy chill as relations became strained over the newly established international criminal court , where washington tried to secure general immunity for all us citizens .
images from guantanamo bay , showing the demeaning caged conditions to which prisoners from afghanistan were subjected , did n't help matters , and neither did the u.s. pledge to use military means should saddam hussein not step down . the last point ended up being the final straw for the german public .
chancellor schröder , who was running for a second term , saw votes in germany 's war-wariness and turned the iraq debate into a central election campaign issue .
at a rally in the small lower saxony town of goslar , he made his first public anti-war statement : " i am opposed to military intervention in iraq .
under my leadership , germany would not take part , " he told an appreciative crowd . washington cool in face of red-green electoral win washington officials raised an eyebrow at the anti-war rhetoric from berlin , which had until then never surfaced in such a public way .
relations between berlin and washington hit a further low point in september , when the then-german minister of justice , herta däubler-gmelin , allegedly compared bush with adolf hitler . the reports , published by a local german newspaper , had hit washington before däubler-gmelin had a chance to utter her denial .
the outrage at the far side of the atlantic swelled to volcanic proportions , and the statement was denounced as " monstrous " .
but with just days to go to the election schröder was reluctant to let the justice minister go , convincing her instead to forgo a post in the new cabinet . the white house responded coolly to the news that the red-green coalition had sealed a second term in office : there was no congratulatory phone call or telegram .
to some , the snub was an unmistakable indication that what german politicians said during the election campaign would not be easily forgotten .
schröder tried to heal the rift , stating that a friendship as good as germany and america 's ought to be able to bear the weight of differing opinions . but it was not until foreign minister joschka fischer and defense minister peter struck went to washington on a peacemaking mission in november , that schröder was granted a ten-minute phone call with president bush .
they did n't meet face to face again until the nato summit in prague in november , when the demonstrative handshake between the two men was considered a sensation . " new europe " on the issue of iraq , the chancellor stood firm , repeating his opposition to a war , and categorically ruling out any german involvement .
in january of this year , schröder received the public backing from french president jacques chirac , who used the occasion of the german-franco friendship treaty to make it clear that he too , was against any military attack on iraq .
it was n't long before schröder and chirac had russian president vladimir putin on board , completing the trio they needed to prevent legitimate u.s. intervention through the un security council . u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld responded to the formation of the trio by dubbing france and germany " old europe " , and voicing his preference for " new europe " with such countries as poland and romania , which had pledged to support a war against iraq .
and schröder had to sit back and listen as his country was named in the same breath as the dictatorships which rule cuba and libya . although france has topped germany as primary target for washington 's ire , u.s.-german relations have not improved , at least not at government level .
opposition politicians such as cdu leader angela merkel are openly received in washington , and defense minister peter struck and some deputies were were received well at a recent nato summit in washington .
but for the time being at least , the telephone line between schröder and bush remains conspicuously dead . klaus dahmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the claim was made by the professional organisation chartered institute of housing in scotland -lrb- cih -rrb- .
it said that pensioners who stay in the family home after their children have moved out may be hit by an anomaly in the way benefits are assessed .
the situation could affect elderly tenants involved in recent high-profile stock transfers in glasgow , the borders and dumfries and galloway .
whilst it may only be an oversight the consequence could be devastating for thousands of pensioners in scotland alan ferguson cih the loophole means that benefits claims from pensioners living in housing association properties are weighed up differently to those staying in council houses .
when local authority tenants are assessed for benefit entitlement , the department of work and pensions -lrb- dwp -rrb- does not take into account the size of their house .
this means that pensioners still living in the homes where they raised their children do not receive less cash because their houses are larger than they reasonably require .
but cih said that pensioners in the same situation whose homes have been transferred to independent landlords could find their eligibility for full benefits being questioned .
' heavy impact ' cih 's director in scotland , alan ferguson , said he has written to the dwp and scottish executive in a bid to secure a change in the law .
" the housing benefit regulations are very technical and rather bureaucratic but their effects can be very real and impact heavily on individuals , " he said .
" it appears that when amendments were made to the regulations that should cover the whole of the uk , scotland was unfortunately overlooked .
" whilst it may only be an oversight the consequence could be devastating for thousands of pensioners in scotland . "
the dwp has pledged to examine the situation and insisted it was " unlikely " that any pensioners would lose their benefits as a result .
thousands of homes owned by scottish local authorities have been transferred to independent landlords since regulations were changed in october 2002 .

the online store has more than 200,000 songs for sale , costing 99 cents each .
worries in the record industry that customers would cherry-pick hit songs have not come true , with more than half of all songs purchased as part of full album downloads .
however , there are indications of first cracks in the revenue model .
some macintosh users have reportedly begun to circumvent apple 's copy-protection software and began to swap songs online - without paying .
us , macintosh only - for now so far the service is accessible to less than 5 % of the world 's computer users , those owning an apple macintosh and living in the united states a windows version of itunes is planned for later this year , and an overseas expansion is on the cards as well .
the itunes web site allows customers to listen to brief snippets of songs before deciding whether to buy them .
by clicking a button the music is downloaded to their computer and can then be " burned " on cds , copied to up to three other macintoshs , or transferred to digital music players like apple 's popular ipod .
apple 's online music store is the first of its kind that shows any clear commercial success .
most record companies have tried in some shape or another , but failed to attract customers in large numbers .
getting music online was popularised by file-swapping service napster , which is now-defunct .
it allowed napster users to swap songs with each other , but without paying any royalties to artists or record companies .
napster was taken to court and shut down , because its service was based on a central registry of available files held on napster 's computers .
other file-swapping services like kazaa and morpheus use different decentralised technologies that allows users to track down and download music , and have so far escaped any legal sanctions .
but analysts and music executives now report the emergence of web sites and software that enables macintosh users to make unauthorised copies of songs downloaded from itunes .
industry executives interviewed by reuters news agency say that so far apple 's success outweighs the services problems , although one was quoted as saying that " no solution is bullet-proof " .

thousands had signed a petition , including bob geldof , danni minogue , elle macpherson and will self , calling on the council to find the £ 1.4m needed to save the zoo , which has a range of exotic and domestic animals .
the council has blamed a £ 6m cut in government funding which has meant it can not afford to bring the attraction in line with new eu zoo regulations .
one of its most popular activities is the contact area where there are supervised animal handling sessions .
about 100,000 people visit the zoo every year , but the council has plans to build glass pyramids on the site and convert it into an eden-style project with a rain forest experience .
it could be open as early as 2005 .
the council has said all the animals will be found safe , alternative homes .
