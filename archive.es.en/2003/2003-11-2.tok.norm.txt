tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .
additionally , prütz called for a differentiated sales tax , a reduction in the work week to 30 hours and the creation of jobs in the service and social security industries , all financed by the state .
while it ’ s unlikely the government would take the alternative proposals tabled at saturday ’ s demonstrations seriously , the sheer mass of protesters does underscore how divisive and unpopular agenda 2010 has proven with voters in this autumn of reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform with his " agenda 2010 " plan of tax cuts , structural reforms and cuts to the social system , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to spur the economy and encourage job creation and consumer spending .

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yukos logo " i think that through the confiscation of shares , one thing will be achieved : the lucrative petroleum market will not fall into foreign hands without controls , especially in american hands , " oliver wieck , the business manager of the east committee of the german economy , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" of course , it goes without saying that that doesn ’ t exactly encourage foreign investors to step into the russian market , " said wieck .
" in regards to future investments , we ’ ll have to look very critically at the situation and future developments . "
but von knoop warned german executives against overreacting .
" we ’ re observing a further interest in investment in russia , " she said .
" that is a result of the consequences of reforms brought under putin , impressive economic indices – growth for five straight years – and it ’ s getting closer to stability . "
the dihk moscow bureau chief said her organization did not believe the russian government is embarking on a course of expropriations .

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .

but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .

tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .
additionally , prütz called for a differentiated sales tax , a reduction in the work week to 30 hours and the creation of jobs in the service and social security industries , all financed by the state .

reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.11.2003 germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a high-flying russian executive with eyes to the west , yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsk is now sitting under investigative arrest .
berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.11.2003 100,000 protest german reforms in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 75 percent of germans are against the government 's reform plans .
tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .

tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .
additionally , prütz called for a differentiated sales tax , a reduction in the work week to 30 hours and the creation of jobs in the service and social security industries , all financed by the state .

tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .
additionally , prütz called for a differentiated sales tax , a reduction in the work week to 30 hours and the creation of jobs in the service and social security industries , all financed by the state .
while it ’ s unlikely the government would take the alternative proposals tabled at saturday ’ s demonstrations seriously , the sheer mass of protesters does underscore how divisive and unpopular agenda 2010 has proven with voters in this autumn of reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform with his " agenda 2010 " plan of tax cuts , structural reforms and cuts to the social system , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to spur the economy and encourage job creation and consumer spending .

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .

" in regards to future investments , we ’ ll have to look very critically at the situation and future developments . "

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yukos logo " i think that through the confiscation of shares , one thing will be achieved : the lucrative petroleum market will not fall into foreign hands without controls , especially in american hands , " oliver wieck , the business manager of the east committee of the german economy , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" of course , it goes without saying that that doesn ’ t exactly encourage foreign investors to step into the russian market , " said wieck .
" in regards to future investments , we ’ ll have to look very critically at the situation and future developments . "
but von knoop warned german executives against overreacting .
" we ’ re observing a further interest in investment in russia , " she said .
" that is a result of the consequences of reforms brought under putin , impressive economic indices – growth for five straight years – and it ’ s getting closer to stability . "
the dihk moscow bureau chief said her organization did not believe the russian government is embarking on a course of expropriations .
" we feel the reaction in germany is excessive . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian business chases european market it ’ s still a lop-sided competition .

tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .
additionally , prütz called for a differentiated sales tax , a reduction in the work week to 30 hours and the creation of jobs in the service and social security industries , all financed by the state .

the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yukos logo " i think that through the confiscation of shares , one thing will be achieved : the lucrative petroleum market will not fall into foreign hands without controls , especially in american hands , " oliver wieck , the business manager of the east committee of the german economy , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" of course , it goes without saying that that doesn ’ t exactly encourage foreign investors to step into the russian market , " said wieck .
" in regards to future investments , we ’ ll have to look very critically at the situation and future developments . "
but von knoop warned german executives against overreacting .
" we ’ re observing a further interest in investment in russia , " she said .
" that is a result of the consequences of reforms brought under putin , impressive economic indices – growth for five straight years – and it ’ s getting closer to stability . "
the dihk moscow bureau chief said her organization did not believe the russian government is embarking on a course of expropriations .
" we feel the reaction in germany is excessive . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian business chases european market it ’ s still a lop-sided competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.11.2003 germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a high-flying russian executive with eyes to the west , yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsk is now sitting under investigative arrest .
berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.11.2003 100,000 protest german reforms in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 75 percent of germans are against the government 's reform plans .
tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .

tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .

" in regards to future investments , we ’ ll have to look very critically at the situation and future developments . "

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yukos logo " i think that through the confiscation of shares , one thing will be achieved : the lucrative petroleum market will not fall into foreign hands without controls , especially in american hands , " oliver wieck , the business manager of the east committee of the german economy , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" of course , it goes without saying that that doesn ’ t exactly encourage foreign investors to step into the russian market , " said wieck .
" in regards to future investments , we ’ ll have to look very critically at the situation and future developments . "
but von knoop warned german executives against overreacting .
" we ’ re observing a further interest in investment in russia , " she said .
" that is a result of the consequences of reforms brought under putin , impressive economic indices – growth for five straight years – and it ’ s getting closer to stability . "
the dihk moscow bureau chief said her organization did not believe the russian government is embarking on a course of expropriations .

tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .
additionally , prütz called for a differentiated sales tax , a reduction in the work week to 30 hours and the creation of jobs in the service and social security industries , all financed by the state .

berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .

tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .
additionally , prütz called for a differentiated sales tax , a reduction in the work week to 30 hours and the creation of jobs in the service and social security industries , all financed by the state .

tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market . the organizers only expected 10,000 demonstrators at saturday afternoon 's protest against the german government ’ s agenda 2010 reform plan .
ten times that number showed up , with close to 100,000 marching and waving signs with slogans like " schröder the thief " in a general strike against planned cuts to the public healthcare system and changes in labor market laws that will make it easier for companies to hire and fire .
a loose-knit alliance of anti-reform critics - including the anti-globalization group attac , the services union ver.di and the successor party to the former east german communists , the party of social democracy -lrb- pds -rrb- – organized saturday ’ s march .
attac 's ilona plattner criticized the planned reforms , which she said would hit the pocketbooks of the poor , the old , the unemployed and ill .
at the same time , she said , tax rates for business and the highest-class of taxpayers would shrink .
reforms unpopular in a country that has long prided itself on its lavish social welfare system , the cuts , which would introduce co-payments on many services and elimante coverage of dentures and tooth replacement , are proving highly unpopular .
indeed , a recent poll showed that 75 percent of germans are against schröder ’ s reforms , which the government is trying to pass in an effort to kickstart the country ’ s stagnant economy .
but few have spoken out against the reforms as energetically as germany ’ s services union , ver.di.
" we want every person in this rich country to live in the right social conditions and in dignity , not that the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer " said bernd riexinger of ver.di ’ s stuttgart chapter .
the protest ’ s organizers said the event had been a " huge success " and that germans ’ anger over the cuts had fuelled the large attendance numbers .
berlin police officials said organizers chartered more than 300 busses from all over germany to ferry protesters to the event , which organizers said marked the start of a season of demonstrations against schröder ’ s agenda 2010 plans .
offering an alternative in the run-up to the demonstration , the event ’ s organizers warned against a lowering of the quality of life for the " masses . "
michael prütz , spokesman for the berlin social forum , told local public radio station inforadio berlin-brandenburg that " it ’ s time for the rich and super wealthy to be tapped for the financing of our community . "
" we have millions of people who earn less than € 1,000 net , " he said .
" no one can say that we live beyond our means . "
prütz ’ s group also offered its own six-point alternative plan to the government ’ s social system reforms .
the group called for a reintroduction of the country ’ s wealth tax , no cut in the highest tax rate and the application of a special tax for the wealthy .
additionally , prütz called for a differentiated sales tax , a reduction in the work week to 30 hours and the creation of jobs in the service and social security industries , all financed by the state .
while it ’ s unlikely the government would take the alternative proposals tabled at saturday ’ s demonstrations seriously , the sheer mass of protesters does underscore how divisive and unpopular agenda 2010 has proven with voters in this autumn of reforms . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's path to reform with his " agenda 2010 " plan of tax cuts , structural reforms and cuts to the social system , german chancellor gerhard schröder wants to spur the economy and encourage job creation and consumer spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.11.2003 germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a high-flying russian executive with eyes to the west , yukos ceo mikhail khodorkovsk is now sitting under investigative arrest .
berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .
german businesses are taking a wait-and-see approach . in a cloak and dagger operation just over a week ago , russian secret service agents nabbed mikhail khodorkovsky , the billionaire russian oil tycoon who heads yukos , a company on the verge of becoming a major international player in petroleum sales .
on thursday , the kremlin seized 44 percent of the company ’ s stock as the investigation against khodorkovsky and other senior executives on tax evasion charges continues .
the moves roused fear in foreign investors , who fear that , after a decade of opening up its markets , russian president vladimir putin could be shifting away from free markets and democracy .
worse yet , they led to chaos on the russian stock market , where shares of yukos and the main stock index in moscow have fallen 20 percent since khodorkovsky ’ s arrest and the stock seizure .
underscoring the fears of the business community , united states state department spokesman richard boucher on friday asked the russian government for assurances the arrest of khodorkovsky was not politically motivated .
after all , khodorkovsky , regarded by forbes magazine as russia ’ s richest man , has been a leading funder of left-wing opposition politicians who are seeking to unseat putin in upcoming federal elections .
media reports in recent weeks also indicated that the tycoon was courting u.s. oil multinationals like chevrontexaco and exxonmobile as investors in yukos , which khodorkovsky has grown into the world 's fourth-largest oil company .
‘ serious questions ’ about rule of law " the freezing of assets yesterday has indeed raised serious questions about the rule of law in russia , " boucher said at his daily press briefing on friday , " and we 've noted that it sparks concerns among domestic and international investors about respect for ownership rights in russia ... we think the russian authorities need to dispel concerns that yukos case is politically motivated .
they need to ensure that it is judged fairly and with full regard for due process of law , applied in a non-selective fashion . "
the german government , meanwhile , warned that russia ’ s case against the oil executive must follow the international standards for rule of law – otherwise it could jeopardize european-russian business ties .
berlin said it viewed the actions taken by the russian government against billionaire oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky as a test case for investment security in russia .
" we ’ re assuming that in this case , the principals of a constitutional state will be observed , " said thomas steg , a spokesman for chancellor gerhard schröder .
following rule of law , steg said , is essential for russia to succeed in integrating with the international economy .
the ability of foreign companies to invest in security and with stable planning is essential for a deepening engagement and cooperation between russia and the european union , he warned .
however , the government spokesman refused to comment on the specifics of the case .
moscow rejects criticism over the weekend , the russian foreign ministry issued a statement deriding the state department ’ s questioning as " at the very least , tactless and disrespectful . "
the foreign ministry said the u.s. had overlooked similar cases in other countries .
mixed reactions from german executives reactions in germany have been mixed .
some business leaders have said the yukos case could stem the flow of investment from germany , russia ’ s largest single trading partner .
russia is also an extremely important market for germany , whose companies exported € 11.4 billion worth of goods there in 2002 .
but the german chamber of commerce in moscow says the companies it represents see no immediate threat to their investments .
" i have asked many companies -lrb- about the developments -rrb- , and all have said , ‘ our investment policies aren ’ t going to change – nor is our planned investment exposure ' , " andrea von knoop , who heads the moscow office of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the news agency reuters .
the vast majority of the 2,000-odd german companies represented in moscow are going on with their business in russia under the assumption that the investment environment will remain stable , with considerable upside potential .
according to von knoop , khodorkovsky ’ s arrest is a sign that the legal system in russia also applies to many oligarchs who built their wealth under dubious circumstances .
the government ’ s seizing of yukos stock , she said , was a normal procedure for such cases .
though russian president putin has stated that the arrest was neither politically motivated nor a move to expropriate a private oil company , some german executives believe the moves could have far-reaching implications .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yukos logo " i think that through the confiscation of shares , one thing will be achieved : the lucrative petroleum market will not fall into foreign hands without controls , especially in american hands , " oliver wieck , the business manager of the east committee of the german economy , told german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" of course , it goes without saying that that doesn ’ t exactly encourage foreign investors to step into the russian market , " said wieck .
" in regards to future investments , we ’ ll have to look very critically at the situation and future developments . "
but von knoop warned german executives against overreacting .
" we ’ re observing a further interest in investment in russia , " she said .
" that is a result of the consequences of reforms brought under putin , impressive economic indices – growth for five straight years – and it ’ s getting closer to stability . "
the dihk moscow bureau chief said her organization did not believe the russian government is embarking on a course of expropriations .

water at the beaches was tested every fortnight this year between 1 may and 30 september by the environment agency .
testing times the results , which include mandatory and the more stringent ec directive guidelines , can go forward to a blue flag jury .
councils have to apply to the blue flag jury by next week but failing the testing programme means they can not gain the award .

but the opposition conservative group on the council says shoppers will be encouraged into using out-of-town shopping centres .
it is estimated the evening charges will raise £ 600,000 for the council 's coffers and sunday charges will bring in a further £ 235,000 .
after 1800 gmt on weekdays and saturdays , motorists will have to pay 80 pence for a one-hour stay , £ 1.60 for two hours , and a flat rate of £ 2 after that .
on sundays , it will cost motorists £ 1 to park for up to five hours and £ 2 for the whole day .

it 's a big battle for small developers the dot.com bubble burst and the dominance of big name producers and publishers has created a difficult climate for struggling independent developers with good ideas .
in july , the french government announced its plan to offer four million euros -lrb- £ 2.9m -rrb- to help aspiring game developers turn their ideas into reality .
the country is home to three of the world 's top 10 video games publishers already , making it a leader in the games industry .
but many publishers are still feeling cautious , betting on developers who are designing for lucrative markets abroad .
big players companies like infogrames , the parent company of atari , has done well to ride the wave of the video game boom .
it has published some of the world 's best-selling titles , and it has the development budgets to prove it .

it vividly illustrates that as games have become more sophisticated , budgets have shot through the roof .
ten years ago games cost about $ 200,000 to produce , but now they cost between $ 3m and $ 7m .
" it is expensive because you have about 24 months of production and the production team is about 20 and it can go up to about 40 in the peak , " stephane baudet , head of eden studios , told clickonline .
" so it requires a lot of time and a lot of people . "
with budgets mounting , production money is targeted rather than spread around , which is great if you have a proven track record as a developer and a winning formula .
it is not so good if you are a struggling independent looking to make your mark , explains mr baudet .
" the big players are winning and the smaller players are losing and it is going to be very difficult to reverse the trend right now . "
caution with the french government 's intervention however , the smaller outfits are fighting back .
arkane is one of 21 small studios awarded a state grant to get their video game project from drawing board to the console .
but with so much being invested in individual games , publishers are still cautious .
publishers need to take a leap of faith in smaller outfits many are opting for developers which are more intimate with the industry 's most lucrative mass market , the usa , says head of arkane studios raphael colantonio .
" there have been very few european developers who have been able to deliver great international success , " he says .
" i think that 's the reason why publishers such as infogrames or atari are now more focused on american developers , because for them it is a safer success .
" that is not necessarily true , but the situation is the market is difficult and the money is lower than it used to be , so people tend to make safer choices . "
touch of france there is nothing new in france 's government lending a hand to creative industries , such as cinema , which they invented .
france has long considered artistic products as " exceptions " , unique to their cultural heritage , and so worthy of financial support or protection from the ruthless market .
but with the government wading in on behalf of small video game studios , the question is whether the joystick and the console will enjoy the protection of the " cultural exception francaise " .
" i do n't think that video games could fit within the ' exception francaise ' because it is very difficult for us to convince the government that what we do is culture , " says mr baudet .
" it is easier for them to finance and to help the cinema or the book industry , but the video industry is seen as a leisure something , and not very cultural . "
that said , french video game designers do glory in the term the " french touch " .
it describes the distinctive look of gallic games , which is partly down to france 's addiction to comic strips .
the young designers of video games are picking up a style where the country 's cartoonists have left off .
with powerful video game publishers veering towards safe bets of games with an american look , perhaps , for the sake of diversity , a little state intervention is not such a bad idea .

in july , the french government announced its plan to offer four million euros -lrb- £ 2.9m -rrb- to help aspiring game developers turn their ideas into reality .
the country is home to three of the world 's top 10 video games publishers already , making it a leader in the games industry .
but many publishers are still feeling cautious , betting on developers who are designing for lucrative markets abroad .
big players companies like infogrames , the parent company of atari , has done well to ride the wave of the video game boom .
it has published some of the world 's best-selling titles , and it has the development budgets to prove it .
there have been very few european developers who have been able to deliver great international success ... which is why publishers are now more focused on us developers , because it is a safer success raphael colantonio , arkane studios one of the games it is working on at eden studios is kya : dark lineage for playstation 2 , due to launch in november .
it vividly illustrates that as games have become more sophisticated , budgets have shot through the roof .
ten years ago games cost about $ 200,000 to produce , but now they cost between $ 3m and $ 7m .
" it is expensive because you have about 24 months of production and the production team is about 20 and it can go up to about 40 in the peak , " stephane baudet , head of eden studios , told clickonline .
" so it requires a lot of time and a lot of people . "
with budgets mounting , production money is targeted rather than spread around , which is great if you have a proven track record as a developer and a winning formula .
it is not so good if you are a struggling independent looking to make your mark , explains mr baudet .
" the big players are winning and the smaller players are losing and it is going to be very difficult to reverse the trend right now . "
caution with the french government 's intervention however , the smaller outfits are fighting back .
arkane is one of 21 small studios awarded a state grant to get their video game project from drawing board to the console .
but with so much being invested in individual games , publishers are still cautious .
publishers need to take a leap of faith in smaller outfits many are opting for developers which are more intimate with the industry 's most lucrative mass market , the usa , says head of arkane studios raphael colantonio .
" there have been very few european developers who have been able to deliver great international success , " he says .
" i think that 's the reason why publishers such as infogrames or atari are now more focused on american developers , because for them it is a safer success .
" that is not necessarily true , but the situation is the market is difficult and the money is lower than it used to be , so people tend to make safer choices . "
touch of france there is nothing new in france 's government lending a hand to creative industries , such as cinema , which they invented .
france has long considered artistic products as " exceptions " , unique to their cultural heritage , and so worthy of financial support or protection from the ruthless market .
but with the government wading in on behalf of small video game studios , the question is whether the joystick and the console will enjoy the protection of the " cultural exception francaise " .
" i do n't think that video games could fit within the ' exception francaise ' because it is very difficult for us to convince the government that what we do is culture , " says mr baudet .
" it is easier for them to finance and to help the cinema or the book industry , but the video industry is seen as a leisure something , and not very cultural . "
that said , french video game designers do glory in the term the " french touch " .
it describes the distinctive look of gallic games , which is partly down to france 's addiction to comic strips .
the young designers of video games are picking up a style where the country 's cartoonists have left off .
with powerful video game publishers veering towards safe bets of games with an american look , perhaps , for the sake of diversity , a little state intervention is not such a bad idea .
