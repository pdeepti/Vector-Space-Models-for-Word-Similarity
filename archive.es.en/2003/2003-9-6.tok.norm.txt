germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .
although limbach is well respected and a woman , the fact she is a social democrat will work against her .
vogel , is a cdu member , but is considered by many as too old for the job .
observers say schäuble , who briefly headed the cdu , lacks the charisma and human warm usually required of the presidency . although the liberal free democrats are relishing their role as kingmaker , no fdp politicians are given realistic chances at becoming president .
allied with the cdu in the bundesrat , they are likely to follow the conservatives in the end , but fdp deputy leader rainer brüderle on saturday left open the possibility the liberals could also support an spd candidate . “ it isn ’ t snubbing -lrb- the cdu -rrb- if an opinion is formed during an independent decision-making process , ” he told german ndr television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : rau to retire german president johannes rau , who serves as the country ’ s official head of state , has decided against another run for the office .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .
although limbach is well respected and a woman , the fact she is a social democrat will work against her .
vogel , is a cdu member , but is considered by many as too old for the job .
observers say schäuble , who briefly headed the cdu , lacks the charisma and human warm usually required of the presidency . although the liberal free democrats are relishing their role as kingmaker , no fdp politicians are given realistic chances at becoming president .
allied with the cdu in the bundesrat , they are likely to follow the conservatives in the end , but fdp deputy leader rainer brüderle on saturday left open the possibility the liberals could also support an spd candidate . “ it isn ’ t snubbing -lrb- the cdu -rrb- if an opinion is formed during an independent decision-making process , ” he told german ndr television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : rau to retire german president johannes rau , who serves as the country ’ s official head of state , has decided against another run for the office .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .
although limbach is well respected and a woman , the fact she is a social democrat will work against her .
vogel , is a cdu member , but is considered by many as too old for the job .
observers say schäuble , who briefly headed the cdu , lacks the charisma and human warm usually required of the presidency . although the liberal free democrats are relishing their role as kingmaker , no fdp politicians are given realistic chances at becoming president .
allied with the cdu in the bundesrat , they are likely to follow the conservatives in the end , but fdp deputy leader rainer brüderle on saturday left open the possibility the liberals could also support an spd candidate . “ it isn ’ t snubbing -lrb- the cdu -rrb- if an opinion is formed during an independent decision-making process , ” he told german ndr television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : rau to retire german president johannes rau , who serves as the country ’ s official head of state , has decided against another run for the office .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .
although limbach is well respected and a woman , the fact she is a social democrat will work against her .
vogel , is a cdu member , but is considered by many as too old for the job .
observers say schäuble , who briefly headed the cdu , lacks the charisma and human warm usually required of the presidency . although the liberal free democrats are relishing their role as kingmaker , no fdp politicians are given realistic chances at becoming president .
allied with the cdu in the bundesrat , they are likely to follow the conservatives in the end , but fdp deputy leader rainer brüderle on saturday left open the possibility the liberals could also support an spd candidate . “ it isn ’ t snubbing -lrb- the cdu -rrb- if an opinion is formed during an independent decision-making process , ” he told german ndr television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : rau to retire german president johannes rau , who serves as the country ’ s official head of state , has decided against another run for the office .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .
although limbach is well respected and a woman , the fact she is a social democrat will work against her .
vogel , is a cdu member , but is considered by many as too old for the job .
observers say schäuble , who briefly headed the cdu , lacks the charisma and human warm usually required of the presidency . although the liberal free democrats are relishing their role as kingmaker , no fdp politicians are given realistic chances at becoming president .
allied with the cdu in the bundesrat , they are likely to follow the conservatives in the end , but fdp deputy leader rainer brüderle on saturday left open the possibility the liberals could also support an spd candidate . “ it isn ’ t snubbing -lrb- the cdu -rrb- if an opinion is formed during an independent decision-making process , ” he told german ndr television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : rau to retire german president johannes rau , who serves as the country ’ s official head of state , has decided against another run for the office .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .
this year karl witte , a director at the bremer schulzentrum an der flämischen strasse , has introduced a new class called “ interaction , behavior , conduct . ”
designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .
but he says everything shouldn ’ t be left to the classroom . “ parents are also have a duty .
they have to teach their children values like responsibility , punctuality , honesty and teamwork , ” he said . but the new emphasis on comportment is not without its critics .
the green party in saarbrücken , where courtesy training is headed for the classroom , calls such teaching “ education out of the stone age . ” “ we ’ d rather have brash , critical and obstreperous young people any day than dull , deadened and assimilated ones like the kinds we know from earlier days in our history , ” said christian klein , green party state chairman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany ponders " family vote " in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .

according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .

christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .
christian democrat jürgen schreier is bringing together a commission of educators , psychologists and other experts to work out a way to inculcate behaviors that he says are necessary for the society to function well , such as respect for others , cleanliness , a neat appearance and politeness . “ certain behavioral fundamentals should be sprinkled throughout the regular curriculum , ” he told the newsmagazine der spiegel .
“ i ’ m not saying , for example , that manners should be taught during third period on mondays . ” teaching those p ’ s and q ’ s but that ’ s just what a school in the city-state of bremen is doing .

designed for students around the age of 11 , the one hour a week of instruction in the art of decorum is supposed to head off loutish behavior later on .
according to witt , children have to learn good behavior “ like they learn vocabulary . ” in his class , students and their parents sign a document containing 14 “ basic rules ” of behavior .
curse words are forbidden , greeting one another politely is desired , and spitting on the school grounds is an absolute no-no . witte ’ s gotten support for his battle against boorishness from a variety of sources , including other instructors , who complain that teaching kids who are increasingly growing up without manners is getting harder and harder .
other federal states have expressed interest and hamburg is considering its own program to pass on values and virtues to its own students .
parents in bremen have been enthusiastic supporters . “ many of them are saying , finally , something ’ s happening , ” witte said . polite disagreement martin wansleben , manager at association of german chambers of commerce , echoes the sentiment of his colleagues in the business world who complain that today ’ s young applicants lack maturity and social competence .

germany is facing a epidemic of ill-manners among its young people , according to business leaders and politicians .
they want to see behavior classes in schools to correct the conduct of increasingly uncouth youth . dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ association , complains the country 's young people have lost their manners . while he doesn ’ t particularly like to see spitting in public or hear a stream of curse words coming out of a teenager ’ s mouth , he says the loutish behavior common in the under-twenty set is even starting to impact the workplace .
according to his organization , some 15 percent of young applicants for jobs and apprenticeship programs don ’ t know how to behave in civilized society . “ for some time , companies have been faced with the problem that school graduates often lack knowledge of the most basic rules of conduct , ” he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . he wants to see german schools add courses in refinement to their offerings of reading , writing and arithmetic .
he ’ s not insisting on emily post-level etiquette , but says german young people have forgotten how to interact with one another and the larger society in a civilized way . “ no one can deny that something on the front-end is going terribly wrong , ” said hundt . consensus : something needs to be done he ’ s not the only one who thinks so .
in fact , in a recent survey by the research institute infratest , 77 percent of the population are in favor of some sort of comportment classes in german schools .
only 20 percent think classes that teach behavior basics are not necessary . in the federal state of saarland , the debate over deportment has convinced the minister in charge of education of the necessity of putting manners into the curriculum .

germany ’ s president johannes rau only announced on thursday that he will not seek a second term , but the race to replace him is already heating up .
chancellor schröder has said he supports having a woman president . confirming what many had long suspected , german president johannes rau last week said he would not stand for a second term as the country ’ s ceremonial head of state .
rau , who is 72 years old , said he had personal reasons for stepping down . “ i believe i now have a right to live a little freer than i have up to this point , ” said rau , who before become president was the long-serving premier of germany ’ s largest state north rhine-westphalia . but as a social democrat rau would have likely stood little chance of winning a second five-year term next may anyway , since the joint parliamentary assembly that elects germany ’ s president is currently controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens allies may hold sway in the lower house the bundestag , but the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- together with the smaller free democrats party have a stronger majority in germany ’ s upper house the bundestag , which represents the 16 federal states .
that has put the conservatives in the driving seat in nominating rau ’ s successor , however , odd as it may seem , that could actually end up working to schröder ’ s advantage . a dilemma for the conservatives for the chancellor can now remain above the coming political fray as the conservatives fight amongst themselves about whom to put in germany ’ s highest office .
the decision will be much harder than it sounds , since the choice of the conservatives ’ candidate could set off a internal power struggle within the christian democrats and could determine just who will face schröder in the next general election in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel the key question is whether germany ’ s next president will be woman or not .
although schröder and several other leading social democrats and greens have called for rau ’ s successor to be female , the head of the christian democrats angela merkel has been more hesitant , fearing her party would be less likely to support her bid to unseat schröder as chancellor if there were a woman president . many germans seem to think the time is right for a woman to take on the ceremonial duties of the presidency , but merkel probably believes the country isn ’ t ready to have women in both offices .
therefore having a woman take up the country ’ s top office in may would likely ruin her chances of becoming the conservatives ’ chancellor candidate in three years ’ time . hoping to defuse the gender debate somewhat , cdu secretary general laurenz meyer said on friday the party would not set specific criteria for their presidential candidate : “ it ’ s not about whether it ’ s a man or woman or someone from the south , east or west , but rather it ’ s about finding the most appropriate candidate for this highest state office in germany . ” and the candidates are ... among the politicians being mooted for the top job are the former chief justice of the constitutional court jutta limbach , ex-thuringia premier bernhard vogel and cdu foreign policy expert wolfgang schäuble .
although limbach is well respected and a woman , the fact she is a social democrat will work against her .
vogel , is a cdu member , but is considered by many as too old for the job .
observers say schäuble , who briefly headed the cdu , lacks the charisma and human warm usually required of the presidency . although the liberal free democrats are relishing their role as kingmaker , no fdp politicians are given realistic chances at becoming president .
allied with the cdu in the bundesrat , they are likely to follow the conservatives in the end , but fdp deputy leader rainer brüderle on saturday left open the possibility the liberals could also support an spd candidate . “ it isn ’ t snubbing -lrb- the cdu -rrb- if an opinion is formed during an independent decision-making process , ” he told german ndr television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : rau to retire german president johannes rau , who serves as the country ’ s official head of state , has decided against another run for the office .

they say populations of six of the 21 albatross species have shown " a further alarming decrease " .
one , previously thought to be safe , is now believed to be at high risk of extinction .
the culprits are said to be longline fishing boats , blamed for thousands of bird deaths annually .
the warning is sounded by birdlife international , an alliance of conservation groups working in more than 100 countries .
no species safe birdlife representatives from south africa , france , australia , new zealand , argentina , the us and the uk have been meeting at a workshop in cape town , to bring together global tracking data on albatrosses and petrels .
birdlife says research its experts have analysed shows the mounting peril the birds face , with all 21 species now thought to face some risk of extinction .
birdlife 's assessment is based on the classification used for the red list of threatened species compiled by iucn-the world conservation union .
the five relevant categories are critically endangered -lrb- a species facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild -rrb- ; endangered -lrb- very high risk -rrb- ; vulnerable -lrb- high risk -rrb- ; near-threatened -lrb- close to qualifying as vulnerable -rrb- ; and least concern -lrb- a category including widespread and abundant species -rrb- .
threat table what has excited birdlife 's alarm is the way the threat to six species is creeping inexorably up the scale : atlantic yellow-nosed albatross , near-threatened in 2000 , is now endangered black-browed albatross , near-threatened in 2000 and vulnerable last year , becomes endangered black-footed , sooty and indian yellow-nosed albatrosses , all up from vulnerable in 2000 to endangered now laysan albatross , of least concern three years ago , is today classed as vulnerable .
the most threatened species of all , the amsterdam albatross , already classed as critically endangered , now faces an additional threat from disease .
only about 20 pairs breed each year , and chicks are dying more often .
birdlife 's director , dr michael rands , said : " the number of seabirds killed by longlines is increasing , as is the number of albatross species in the higher categories of threat due to their continued use .
" longline fishing , especially by pirate vessels , is the single greatest threat to these seabirds . "
voyage of protest longliners are blamed for killing 300,000 seabirds annually , a third of them albatrosses .
the birds swallow the baited hooks on the fishing lines , which can be 80 miles -lrb- 130 km -rrb- long , and either die of their injuries or simply drown .
birdlife and other conservationists are working with the fleets to promote bird-friendly fishing methods .
the british trans-atlantic oarsman john ridgway is spending a year sailing the southern ocean to campaign for action against illegal fishing .
he is due soon in cape town , where his expedition will be demonstrating best practice aboard a longlining boat .

the five relevant categories are critically endangered -lrb- a species facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild -rrb- ; endangered -lrb- very high risk -rrb- ; vulnerable -lrb- high risk -rrb- ; near-threatened -lrb- close to qualifying as vulnerable -rrb- ; and least concern -lrb- a category including widespread and abundant species -rrb- .
threat table what has excited birdlife 's alarm is the way the threat to six species is creeping inexorably up the scale : atlantic yellow-nosed albatross , near-threatened in 2000 , is now endangered black-browed albatross , near-threatened in 2000 and vulnerable last year , becomes endangered black-footed , sooty and indian yellow-nosed albatrosses , all up from vulnerable in 2000 to endangered now laysan albatross , of least concern three years ago , is today classed as vulnerable .
the most threatened species of all , the amsterdam albatross , already classed as critically endangered , now faces an additional threat from disease .
only about 20 pairs breed each year , and chicks are dying more often .
black-footed albatrosses at the nest -lrb- image : kathy cousins -rrb- birdlife 's director , dr michael rands , said : " the number of seabirds killed by longlines is increasing , as is the number of albatross species in the higher categories of threat due to their continued use .
" longline fishing , especially by pirate vessels , is the single greatest threat to these seabirds . "
voyage of protest longliners are blamed for killing 300,000 seabirds annually , a third of them albatrosses .
the birds swallow the baited hooks on the fishing lines , which can be 80 miles -lrb- 130 km -rrb- long , and either die of their injuries or simply drown .
birdlife and other conservationists are working with the fleets to promote bird-friendly fishing methods .
the british trans-atlantic oarsman john ridgway is spending a year sailing the southern ocean to campaign for action against illegal fishing .
he is due soon in cape town , where his expedition will be demonstrating best practice aboard a longlining boat .

the 13-week-old boxer , george , was snatched from the garden of his home in coventry , says owner sara tasker .
she says the dognappers demanded £ 500 for george 's safe return .
the money was handed over during a meeting in a lay-by .

ms tasker said that she and her partner informed the police about what had happened , but she said that she felt they were not interested in getting george back .
she added : " i 'm very happy that george is home , very relieved that it 's over .
" but at the same time i wo n't lose the bitterness and resentment that i hold for the police right now because , when we needed them most , they let us down . "
in a statement , west midlands police said that there was insufficient evidence to obtain a search warrant to look for the dog , but added officers would continue to try to identify the thieves .
ms tasker said that she was worried that if the police do now choose to investigate , the dognappers could take reprisals against her family .

3g mobiles have become a reality in metropolitan tokyo if you want to gaze into the crystal ball for mobile technology , tokyo is most definitely the place to come to .
in this city it seems like everyone is constantly on the move and a mobile phone has become an indispensable tool of everyday life .
it might help explain why most tokyoites appear to be surgically attached to their mobiles .
the mobile culture is so deeply entrenched here that there are even charging stations where you can breathe life into a dying mobile phone battery .
this obsession may also help explain why japan is at the leading edge of mobile developments .
five years ago , while the rest of us were still struggling with voice calls , the japanese were streaming ahead with data services like imode .
constant evolution one of the first ever data services , imode was developed by ntt docomo , an enterprise which has become synonymous with innovation .

it is approaching two years since 3g became a reality in metropolitan tokyo , and though take up has been modest all the networks now offer the hi-speed service to virtually the entire population .

" looking into the future we see ourselves developing richer and faster mobile communication tools to give mobile phones users a more pleasurable experience . "
even today the network operators are finding different ways of working the benefits of 3g into people 's lives , such as video conferencing between a mobile caller and a laptop user .
with the high-speed networks delivering ever more services , the types of devices are constantly evolving .

camera phones already popular in japan the quality has improved to such a degree that here you can take your photo and then go to a booth and get a reasonable quality print .
camera phones are just beginning to make inroads elsewhere in the world , and industry insiders expect the trickle to become an explosion .
" the camera phone phenomenon that we see in japan right now will be repeated throughout the world , " said matthew nicholson of japanese mobile firm jphone .

finch , 23 , is marrying hywel wigley , son of former plaid cymru leader dafydd wigley and international harpist elinor bennett , in harlech , gwynedd on saturday .
the couple , who have a home in cardiff , have been engaged for 18 months and had planned to go on honeymoon immediately after their big day , with finch hoping to spend a week in italy .
but when she was invited to appear at proms in the park , at singleton park , she immediately put all plans of a honeymoon on hold .
i am looking forward to my wedding day , but i am excited about proms in the park too catrin finch now , the wedding will be followed by rehearsals for the open air concert , while her new husband will have to be content with joining thousands of spectators in swansea .
despite playing in prestigious concert venues across the world , finch was adamant this performance was one she simply could not miss .
" i am looking forward to my wedding day , but i am excited about proms in the park too , " she said .
" we have been engaged for about a year and a half and it will be a very traditional church wedding , only the honeymoon will be a bit later than planned .
" i have played in swansea a couple of times , but i have never played an outdoor concert in the city and never played in singleton park .
london 's albert hall will link with swansea 's proms in the park " the opportunity to play there and as part of the last night of the proms was just too good an opportunity to miss .
" hywel will be there and members of my family too and i am sure it will be a great night .
" we have not scrapped our honeymoon plans all together , hopefully there will be the chance to get away later in the year . "
finch , who has just launched her debut cd for sony classical entitled crossing the stone , already holds the honour of being the youngest person to perform at a bbc promenade concert at the royal albert hall .
she performed there with the national youth orchestra at the age of 10 and again every year until the age of 16 .
fireworks originally from llanon near aberystwyth , finch fell in love with the harp when her parents took her to a recital by marisa robles at the age of five .
she is a graduate of the royal academy of music and in may 2000 , she received a royal appointment as harpist to the prince of wales after he labelled her a credit to her country .
bbc proms in the park takes place in singleton park on 13 september as part of the uk-wide last night of the proms celebration .
the concert will also feature tenor robert tear , west end singing star steve balsamo and the national youth choir of wales .
after a first half of live classics including a performance by catrin of mozart 's harp and flute concerto , the concert will link up via large screens with the royal albert hall for the traditional last night finale .
a spectacular fireworks display will bring the concert to an end .
