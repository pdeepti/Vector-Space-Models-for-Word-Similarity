in a speech at the historic moncada barracks in santiago de cuba to mark the 50th anniversary of the revolution which brought him to power , mr castro told a crowd of 10,000 : " cuba does not need the help of the european union to survive " .
in 1953 , as a 26-year-old revolutionary , mr castro led about 120 fighters in a raid against the garrison of about 800 soldiers at santiago de cuba .
a group of old colonial powers historically responsible for slave trafficking , looting and even the extermination of entire peoples fidel castro , on the eu fiftieth anniversary in pictures mr castro 's forces were crushed and he was arrested , but cubans still mark the date as the beginning of the revolution .
in this anniversary year , the cuban leader directed his thunder against the eu , which was until recently seen as an economic lifeline for the ailing socialist state .
relations deteriorated rapidly in early june , however , when the eu raised the prospect of sanctions over the cuba 's mass imprisonment of dissidents .
the eu was a " group of old colonial powers historically responsible for slave trafficking , looting and even the extermination of entire peoples " , mr castro told his audience .
sparking a revolution national celebrations of the 50th anniversary include fireworks , cultural galas and an appearance by elian gonzalez - the child at the centre of a row between the us and cuba three years ago .
bbc news online looks back at the revolution that brought fidel castro to power in pictures hundreds of cuban children have also re-enacted the attack on the barracks .
a number of mr castro 's ill-armed revolutionaries were killed or captured in the attack on the barracks and he was put on trial .
" convict me ; it does not matter .
history will absolve me , " mr castro , a trained lawyer , told the court in a speech which became a manifesto for the cuban revolution .
he was sentenced to 15 years in prison but was freed in a general amnesty less than two years later .
he went to mexico and later returned to cuba to oust the right-wing dictator fulgencio batista on 1 january 1959 .
he has since become the world 's longest-serving head of government , outlasting nine us presidents and long-standing american hostility to his regime .
uncertain future his country has gone from being the third-richest in latin america to one of the poorest .
cubans use many methods to flee towards florida its economy now relies heavily on funds sent from cubans abroad and on tourism , much of which stems from the eu .
untold numbers of cubans flee the island every year , trying to cross to nearby florida - including via a truck turned into a raft this week .
however , cuba can still boast good healthcare and education : it has the highest life expectancy in latin america and one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world it has one doctor per 166 people and one of the most extensive free public health systems in the world it also has one of the highest literacy rates in the world , with just over 95 % of the population being able to read but as president castro nears his 77th birthday in august , many cubans wonder how much longer he will remain in power , and what may happen when he dies .
" there is a sense of resigned expectation on the island because no one really knows how cuba is going to get out of this hole , " eusebio mujal-leon , a cuban-born professor now based in washington , told reuters news agency .

declaring a nationwide " state of rebellion , " ms arroyo gave the group of soldiers until 1700 -lrb- 0900 gmt -rrb- to leave the prestigious glorietta complex in the makati financial district or be forced out .
the president ordered the military and police " to suppress and quell the rebellion " under special powers given to her by the constitution .
the disaffected soldiers took control of the complex in the early hours of the morning , and ringed it with what appear to be explosives .
they are demanding the resignation of ms arroyo and her defence minister , angelo reyes , accusing the government of corruption .
your actions are already hovering at the fringes of outright terrorism arroyo message to mutineers residents of an apartment block inside the complex - including australia 's ambassador to the philippines and other foreign nationals - left the compound early on sunday after being trapped by the incident .
the rebels - thought to number only a few dozen - said they had only been kept inside until daylight for their own safety .
correspondents at the scene say the situation is complex , with evidence of mutineers exchanging handshakes with the troops sent to surround them .
the us state department has expressed its " full support " for president arroyo - a position echoed by australia 's foreign minister .
" we do n't want to see presidents fall out of the barrel of a gun , " alexander downer said .
' reasonable force ' in a televised address , ms arroyo warned the rebels that her troops would use " reasonable force " to retake the complex and insisted that she remained in full control of affairs .
analysis : symptom of malaise in pictures : manila mutiny telling the mutineers that she was their " commander-in-chief " , she said : " you have crossed the line of professionalism and are now engaged in unlawful political action backed by the use of force .
" your actions are already hovering at the fringes of outright terrorism . "
in an earlier speech on tv , she had vowed to track down a group of " rogue " junior officers who had abandoned their posts , taking their weapons with them .
one of the officers on the government 's arrest order denied the group was plotting a coup and told reporters outside the complex that the soldiers had only planted explosives as a defence .
" we are not attempting to grab power - we are just trying to express our grievances , " said lieutenant antonio trillanes .
" these explosives are set to defend our position .
if they try to take us down , we will be forced to use them . "
he said the government had put out a " death warrant " against himself and the others to " suppress what we know " .
red armbands displayed by the mutineers feature a sun-symbol flag used in the resistance against spanish colonial rule .
armed with rifles , they arrived wearing baseball caps and black backpacks .
allegations the group accuses the government of staging terrorist attacks in the philippines as a means of getting military aid from the us .
the bbc 's john mclean in manila says such allegations have been aired before , but the rebel soldiers have provided no proof for their claims .
the limited number of soldiers involved and the apparent lack of public support for them means that the rebels are more of a nuisance than a threat to the government , he notes .
but our correspondent adds that the incident reinforces the perception that the government is not in a secure position .
a predecessor of president arroyo , corazon aquino , fended off several coup attempts in the late 1980s by officers complaining about corruption .

but human beings are hard to recreate , because along with all those tiny details in the way we look , there is the way we move , our expressions .
now there is a new type of computer graphics card which is bringing virtual humans a lot closer .
dawn fairy is a virtual human , or avatar , created by nvidia to showcase their new geforce graphics card .
in the past , each frame of her scenes would take a computer hours to draw , and the whole thing would be stuck together afterwards to make the movie .
if you wanted to draw each frame faster , in real-time , you would have to go for a less detailed , more cartoon-like character , like lara croft .
the dawn demo takes the best of both worlds , with very detailed graphics being calculated and drawn at very high speed as the frames are needed .
" if we look at how games are done currently , you can see that although they have the right skin colour and the faces have eyes and noses and mouths , they lack the imperfections that make them look realistic , " said nvidia 's andrew humbar .
" typically , the closer you zoom into a real-time character , the worse the image quality gets .
but the closer you get to dawn , the better she gets .
" that 's when you really start to see the detail .
so if you look at her skin , she has moles ; if you look at her eyes , she has a retina , she has a cornea and blood vessels in the eye . " 150,000 triangles the geforce chip is made of copper instead of aluminium , which means it can run faster , at 500 mhz or thereabouts .
it gets quite warm , which is why it comes complete with its own cooling system . "
if we can produce avatars that convincingly behave like people , that look like people , there 's no reason why people wo n't accept avatars " patrick olivier , lexicle it is this extra speed that allows the chip to handle a similar quality of image to those in recent animated movies .
" dawn is made up of over 150,000 triangles .
these triangles form a mesh , and this mesh is controlled to create the very realistic movement that we see in this particular demo , " said mr humbar .
" the smaller the triangles , and the more triangles there are , the more control we can have over that particular image .
" if you look at dawn 's face and you can see all the different emotions , they 're all being created by being able to manipulate and change the attributes of those triangles . "
because the images can now be drawn almost instantly , as they are needed on screen , it means avatars can now both look very detailed , and react to you in real-time .
human imperfections looking good is important , but if an avatar is to be totally life-like , it will have to sound good too .
how do you give a computer a human voice ?
do you pre-record every single english word , with every single inflection ?
it was a problem faced by jonathan jowitt , when he invented the news reading avatar ananova .
" most avatar systems that are on the market today use a process of converting written text into audio , " said mr jowitt .
" in previous times , a text-to-speech engine would look at how are the words are constructed , and try to reassemble that in an audio domain , using short phonetic sounds .
" things have moved on , so that engines these days know combinations of letters and word clusters .
our new text-to-speech engine apparently has the word ' the ' in 700 times , which is impossible to believe , but some of the pronunciations of ' the ' are very short . "
just as the key to looking human is the imperfections , it is important that the avatar does not sound too perfect either .
" we 've actually tried to help the suspension of disbelief , by adding in the guttural and mouth sounds that you would n't get out of a text-to-speech engine .
" our version of the text-to-speech engine has breathing , it has little throat clears in there , and little tongue tick sounds that are in between sentences .
that certainly adds a layer of human element to it that would n't be in the engine in the first place , " said mr jowitt .
human or zombie ?
the next challenge is to ensure the avatar behaves like a human .
cara , the online customer service avatar developed by lexicle , is designed to put customers at ease by displaying a more subtle human trait - body language .
" if you think about it , what do people do when they speak ? " asked patrick olivier , a computer linguist with lexicle .
" they move their hands , they gesture , their facial expression changes , their lips move ; and you tend to beat your hands , nod your head on words that you 're trying to emphasise in that sentence , on words that are important in that sentence .
" it 's critical to be able to compute those gestures automatically if you want your avatar to be convincing .
although you can get the graphical stuff right , you do n't know what to make that avatar do unless it 's got a brain driving it behind it . "
avatars seem to be getting ever more lifelike , but even here , there is a danger .
as your avatar approaches reality it could fall into what is called the zombie zone .
a japanese researcher has investigated how people react to avatars as they become more and more real , or naturalistic .
" he discovered that people 's reactions to them improved quite nicely until they were almost naturalistic , and then there was a really sudden drop , " said ruth aylett , professor of intelligent virtual environments at the university of salford .
" the explanation for this was that you develop expectations about the character , that it is actually human , that it is actually real .
" then suddenly those expectations are violated by something that slightly wrong in the voice , or the face , or in the way it moves , and it gives you a horrible feeling that is not real .
" and that 's why we call it the zombie zone informally , because it 's almost as if it was a zombie .
it 's the living dead . "
although there is a fair way to go before they become totally lifelike , avatars are even now working their way into every corner of our lives .
you can already create an avatar of yourself to attach to e-mails , or send to your mobile phone , or just to do the things you would never do .
" if we can produce avatars that convincingly behave like people , that look like people , and hopefully can actually perform tasks better than people , there 's no reason why people wo n't accept avatars , " said lexicle 's patrick olivier .
" they 're going to make everyone 's life easier . "

" if we look at how games are done currently , you can see that although they have the right skin colour and the faces have eyes and noses and mouths , they lack the imperfections that make them look realistic , " said nvidia 's andrew humbar .
" typically , the closer you zoom into a real-time character , the worse the image quality gets .
but the closer you get to dawn , the better she gets .
" that 's when you really start to see the detail .
so if you look at her skin , she has moles ; if you look at her eyes , she has a retina , she has a cornea and blood vessels in the eye . " 150,000 triangles the geforce chip is made of copper instead of aluminium , which means it can run faster , at 500 mhz or thereabouts .
it gets quite warm , which is why it comes complete with its own cooling system .
if we can produce avatars that convincingly behave like people , that look like people , there 's no reason why people wo n't accept avatars patrick olivier , lexicle it is this extra speed that allows the chip to handle a similar quality of image to those in recent animated movies .
" dawn is made up of over 150,000 triangles .
these triangles form a mesh , and this mesh is controlled to create the very realistic movement that we see in this particular demo , " said mr humbar .
" the smaller the triangles , and the more triangles there are , the more control we can have over that particular image .
" if you look at dawn 's face and you can see all the different emotions , they 're all being created by being able to manipulate and change the attributes of those triangles . "
because the images can now be drawn almost instantly , as they are needed on screen , it means avatars can now both look very detailed , and react to you in real-time .
human imperfections looking good is important , but if an avatar is to be totally life-like , it will have to sound good too .
how do you give a computer a human voice ?
do you pre-record every single english word , with every single inflection ?
is ananova the news reader of the future it was a problem faced by jonathan jowitt , when he invented the news reading avatar ananova .
" most avatar systems that are on the market today use a process of converting written text into audio , " said mr jowitt .
" in previous times , a text-to-speech engine would look at how are the words are constructed , and try to reassemble that in an audio domain , using short phonetic sounds .
" things have moved on , so that engines these days know combinations of letters and word clusters .
our new text-to-speech engine apparently has the word ' the ' in 700 times , which is impossible to believe , but some of the pronunciations of ' the ' are very short . "
just as the key to looking human is the imperfections , it is important that the avatar does not sound too perfect either .
" we 've actually tried to help the suspension of disbelief , by adding in the guttural and mouth sounds that you would n't get out of a text-to-speech engine .
" our version of the text-to-speech engine has breathing , it has little throat clears in there , and little tongue tick sounds that are in between sentences .
that certainly adds a layer of human element to it that would n't be in the engine in the first place , " said mr jowitt .
human or zombie ?
the next challenge is to ensure the avatar behaves like a human .
cara , the online customer service avatar developed by lexicle , is designed to put customers at ease by displaying a more subtle human trait - body language .
cara puts a human face on financial transactions " if you think about it , what do people do when they speak ? " asked patrick olivier , a computer linguist with lexicle .
" they move their hands , they gesture , their facial expression changes , their lips move ; and you tend to beat your hands , nod your head on words that you 're trying to emphasise in that sentence , on words that are important in that sentence .
" it 's critical to be able to compute those gestures automatically if you want your avatar to be convincing .
although you can get the graphical stuff right , you do n't know what to make that avatar do unless it 's got a brain driving it behind it . "
avatars seem to be getting ever more lifelike , but even here , there is a danger .
as your avatar approaches reality it could fall into what is called the zombie zone .
a japanese researcher has investigated how people react to avatars as they become more and more real , or naturalistic .
" he discovered that people 's reactions to them improved quite nicely until they were almost naturalistic , and then there was a really sudden drop , " said ruth aylett , professor of intelligent virtual environments at the university of salford .
" the explanation for this was that you develop expectations about the character , that it is actually human , that it is actually real .
" then suddenly those expectations are violated by something that slightly wrong in the voice , or the face , or in the way it moves , and it gives you a horrible feeling that is not real .
" and that 's why we call it the zombie zone informally , because it 's almost as if it was a zombie .
it 's the living dead . "
although there is a fair way to go before they become totally lifelike , avatars are even now working their way into every corner of our lives .
you can already create an avatar of yourself to attach to e-mails , or send to your mobile phone , or just to do the things you would never do .
" if we can produce avatars that convincingly behave like people , that look like people , and hopefully can actually perform tasks better than people , there 's no reason why people wo n't accept avatars , " said lexicle 's patrick olivier .
" they 're going to make everyone 's life easier . "

" typically , the closer you zoom into a real-time character , the worse the image quality gets .
but the closer you get to dawn , the better she gets .

" dawn is made up of over 150,000 triangles .
these triangles form a mesh , and this mesh is controlled to create the very realistic movement that we see in this particular demo , " said mr humbar .
" the smaller the triangles , and the more triangles there are , the more control we can have over that particular image .
" if you look at dawn 's face and you can see all the different emotions , they 're all being created by being able to manipulate and change the attributes of those triangles . "
because the images can now be drawn almost instantly , as they are needed on screen , it means avatars can now both look very detailed , and react to you in real-time .
human imperfections looking good is important , but if an avatar is to be totally life-like , it will have to sound good too .

" most avatar systems that are on the market today use a process of converting written text into audio , " said mr jowitt .

" things have moved on , so that engines these days know combinations of letters and word clusters .
our new text-to-speech engine apparently has the word ' the ' in 700 times , which is impossible to believe , but some of the pronunciations of ' the ' are very short . "
just as the key to looking human is the imperfections , it is important that the avatar does not sound too perfect either .
" we 've actually tried to help the suspension of disbelief , by adding in the guttural and mouth sounds that you would n't get out of a text-to-speech engine .
" our version of the text-to-speech engine has breathing , it has little throat clears in there , and little tongue tick sounds that are in between sentences .
that certainly adds a layer of human element to it that would n't be in the engine in the first place , " said mr jowitt .
human or zombie ?
the next challenge is to ensure the avatar behaves like a human .
cara , the online customer service avatar developed by lexicle , is designed to put customers at ease by displaying a more subtle human trait - body language .
cara puts a human face on financial transactions " if you think about it , what do people do when they speak ? " asked patrick olivier , a computer linguist with lexicle .
" they move their hands , they gesture , their facial expression changes , their lips move ; and you tend to beat your hands , nod your head on words that you 're trying to emphasise in that sentence , on words that are important in that sentence .
" it 's critical to be able to compute those gestures automatically if you want your avatar to be convincing .
although you can get the graphical stuff right , you do n't know what to make that avatar do unless it 's got a brain driving it behind it . "
avatars seem to be getting ever more lifelike , but even here , there is a danger .
as your avatar approaches reality it could fall into what is called the zombie zone .
a japanese researcher has investigated how people react to avatars as they become more and more real , or naturalistic .
" he discovered that people 's reactions to them improved quite nicely until they were almost naturalistic , and then there was a really sudden drop , " said ruth aylett , professor of intelligent virtual environments at the university of salford .
" the explanation for this was that you develop expectations about the character , that it is actually human , that it is actually real .
" then suddenly those expectations are violated by something that slightly wrong in the voice , or the face , or in the way it moves , and it gives you a horrible feeling that is not real .
" and that 's why we call it the zombie zone informally , because it 's almost as if it was a zombie .
it 's the living dead . "
although there is a fair way to go before they become totally lifelike , avatars are even now working their way into every corner of our lives .
you can already create an avatar of yourself to attach to e-mails , or send to your mobile phone , or just to do the things you would never do .
" if we can produce avatars that convincingly behave like people , that look like people , and hopefully can actually perform tasks better than people , there 's no reason why people wo n't accept avatars , " said lexicle 's patrick olivier .
" they 're going to make everyone 's life easier . "

his excellency alhaji dr ahmad tejan kabbah , spent the day looking around the university of aberystwyth on saturday .
president kabbah studied at the campus for three years , graduating with a degree in economics in 1959 .
professor derec llwyd morgan , vice chancellor and principal of the university welcomed president kabbah back to his alma mater .
" the visit was a private visit , " he said .
" the fact that dr kabbah wished to see the university at aberystwyth once again is testimony of his deep love of the place and of his appreciation of the education he received here in the late fifties .
president kabbah graduated with a degree in economics " few universities have the honour of receiving former students as state presidents .
" aberystwyth is proud of its connection with dr kabbah and wishes sierra leone a peaceful , prosperous future , " he added .
during his visit , president kabbah , looked around the site of a proposed building for the international politics department , the arts centre and the old college .
sierra leone during his time in office , the president has seen his country , the west african state of sierra leone , emerge from a decade of civil war which ended in early 2002 , with the help of britain , the former colonial power , and a large united nations peacekeeping mission .
more than 17,000 foreign troops disarmed tens of thousands of rebels and militia fighters in the biggest un peacekeeping success in africa for many years after debacles in the 1990s in angola , rwanda and somalia .
a lasting feature of the civil war was the atrocities committed by the rebels , whose trademark was to hack off the hands of their victims .
president kabbah won a new five-year term in elections in may 2002 and is credited with bringing in foreign assistance to rescue his country from itself .
he first took office in march 1996 following war-time elections which brought a formal end to four years of army rule .
however , disgruntled soldiers toppled him in may 1997 .
a west african intervention force reinstated him within a year .
saved by british military help , kabbah agreed a ceasefire in november 2000 .
this allowed the un force to deploy throughout the country and disarm combatants .

the government 's adviser on religious affairs , the man who counsels malaysia 's prime minister mahathir mohamad , said as long as the message was clear and unambiguous it was valid under islamic sharia law .
" sms is just another form of writing , " dr abdul hamid othman was quoted by the new straits times daily newspaper as saying .
the decision follows a malaysian court 's ruling on thursday in favour of a man who served divorce on his wife via a text message .
sharia judge mohamad fauzi ismail declared that the divorce declaration was valid and that as such the marriage between the plaintiff azida fazlina abdul latif and defendant shamsudin latif was annulled , the utusan malaysia newspaper reported .
mr shamsudin was said to have sent ms azida a text message saying : " if you do not leave your parents ' house , you 'll be divorced " .
although such a notification of divorce may seem astonishingly brief to some , under islamic law men are allowed to divorce their wives simply be saying the word ' talaq ' - i divorce you - three times .
