the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- , a u.s.-based non-profit organization that works to safeguard press freedom worldwide , has released a report on the number of journalists killed during 2002 .

these journalists are either missing feared dead , or the cause of their demise has yet to be determined .

the report names 19 journalists who died in conflicts and acts of violence while working around the world during the past 12 months .
another 13 names are included under a section titled " motive unconfirmed . "
these journalists are either missing feared dead , or the cause of their demise has yet to be determined .
lowest figures since cpj records began the report claims that the total of 19 is the lowest figure since the cpj began monitoring the on-duty deaths of journalists in 1985 .
this is a radical drop in the number of casualties from the previous year when 37 reporters were killed in 2001 , eight during the conflict in afghanistan .
the cpj attributes the decrease in deaths to the decline in the number of world conflicts .
according to cpj research , a direct correlation exists between the number of journalists killed on the job and the incidence of violent conflict , which the committee believes gives those who target journalists the opportunity to do so with impunity because of the instability that war fosters .
in 1994 , for example , 66 journalists were targeted for their work while civil wars raged in algeria , bosnia , and rwanda .

russia and colombia regularly appear in the yearly reports and the cpj 's list of the dead and missing .
areas of conflict , the highest risk situations for journalists , continued to claim lives .
the report states that five camera operators and photographers , who are especially vulnerable to cross fire and targeting by military forces , were killed in 2002 , including two who were covering conflict in the west bank .
" while we are encouraged to see the number of deaths decrease this year , journalists are still being targeted and assassinated for doing their jobs , " said cpj executive director ann cooper in a statement accompanying the report .
pearl murder led to introduction of preventative steps the plight of journalists killed in action was headline news in 2002 , mainly because of the abduction and murder of the wall street journal 's south asia reporter daniel pearl in pakistan .

in the line of duty and in the line of fire , international journalists called upon to report on war and violence around the world put their life at risk to report from the globe 's danger zones .
not all of them make it back .
the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- , a u.s.-based non-profit organization that works to safeguard press freedom worldwide , has released a report on the number of journalists killed during 2002 .
the report names 19 journalists who died in conflicts and acts of violence while working around the world during the past 12 months .
another 13 names are included under a section titled " motive unconfirmed . "
these journalists are either missing feared dead , or the cause of their demise has yet to be determined .
lowest figures since cpj records began the report claims that the total of 19 is the lowest figure since the cpj began monitoring the on-duty deaths of journalists in 1985 .
this is a radical drop in the number of casualties from the previous year when 37 reporters were killed in 2001 , eight during the conflict in afghanistan .
the cpj attributes the decrease in deaths to the decline in the number of world conflicts .
according to cpj research , a direct correlation exists between the number of journalists killed on the job and the incidence of violent conflict , which the committee believes gives those who target journalists the opportunity to do so with impunity because of the instability that war fosters .
in 1994 , for example , 66 journalists were targeted for their work while civil wars raged in algeria , bosnia , and rwanda .

although the figures reported by the cpj are down since 2001 , journalists still remain at great risk .
the reporting and investigating of violent organizations have claimed lives in countries such as russia , colombia , pakistan , india , bangladesh , and the philippines .
local journalists in these countries have been murdered in direct reprisal for their reporting on crime and corruption , claims the cpj .
russia and colombia regularly appear in the yearly reports and the cpj 's list of the dead and missing .
areas of conflict , the highest risk situations for journalists , continued to claim lives .
the report states that five camera operators and photographers , who are especially vulnerable to cross fire and targeting by military forces , were killed in 2002 , including two who were covering conflict in the west bank .
" while we are encouraged to see the number of deaths decrease this year , journalists are still being targeted and assassinated for doing their jobs , " said cpj executive director ann cooper in a statement accompanying the report .
pearl murder led to introduction of preventative steps the plight of journalists killed in action was headline news in 2002 , mainly because of the abduction and murder of the wall street journal 's south asia reporter daniel pearl in pakistan .
pearl was abducted by activists in karachi in early 2002 and held while his captors demanded the release of pakistani prisoners from the united states military camp in guantanamo bay , cuba .

the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- , a u.s.-based non-profit organization that works to safeguard press freedom worldwide , has released a report on the number of journalists killed during 2002 .
the report names 19 journalists who died in conflicts and acts of violence while working around the world during the past 12 months .
another 13 names are included under a section titled " motive unconfirmed . "
these journalists are either missing feared dead , or the cause of their demise has yet to be determined .
lowest figures since cpj records began the report claims that the total of 19 is the lowest figure since the cpj began monitoring the on-duty deaths of journalists in 1985 .
this is a radical drop in the number of casualties from the previous year when 37 reporters were killed in 2001 , eight during the conflict in afghanistan .
the cpj attributes the decrease in deaths to the decline in the number of world conflicts .
according to cpj research , a direct correlation exists between the number of journalists killed on the job and the incidence of violent conflict , which the committee believes gives those who target journalists the opportunity to do so with impunity because of the instability that war fosters .

russia and colombia regularly appear in the yearly reports and the cpj 's list of the dead and missing .
areas of conflict , the highest risk situations for journalists , continued to claim lives .
the report states that five camera operators and photographers , who are especially vulnerable to cross fire and targeting by military forces , were killed in 2002 , including two who were covering conflict in the west bank .
" while we are encouraged to see the number of deaths decrease this year , journalists are still being targeted and assassinated for doing their jobs , " said cpj executive director ann cooper in a statement accompanying the report .
pearl murder led to introduction of preventative steps the plight of journalists killed in action was headline news in 2002 , mainly because of the abduction and murder of the wall street journal 's south asia reporter daniel pearl in pakistan .
pearl was abducted by activists in karachi in early 2002 and held while his captors demanded the release of pakistani prisoners from the united states military camp in guantanamo bay , cuba .

the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- , a u.s.-based non-profit organization that works to safeguard press freedom worldwide , has released a report on the number of journalists killed during 2002 .
the report names 19 journalists who died in conflicts and acts of violence while working around the world during the past 12 months .
another 13 names are included under a section titled " motive unconfirmed . "
these journalists are either missing feared dead , or the cause of their demise has yet to be determined .
lowest figures since cpj records began the report claims that the total of 19 is the lowest figure since the cpj began monitoring the on-duty deaths of journalists in 1985 .
this is a radical drop in the number of casualties from the previous year when 37 reporters were killed in 2001 , eight during the conflict in afghanistan .
the cpj attributes the decrease in deaths to the decline in the number of world conflicts .
according to cpj research , a direct correlation exists between the number of journalists killed on the job and the incidence of violent conflict , which the committee believes gives those who target journalists the opportunity to do so with impunity because of the instability that war fosters .

local journalists in these countries have been murdered in direct reprisal for their reporting on crime and corruption , claims the cpj .
russia and colombia regularly appear in the yearly reports and the cpj 's list of the dead and missing .
areas of conflict , the highest risk situations for journalists , continued to claim lives .
the report states that five camera operators and photographers , who are especially vulnerable to cross fire and targeting by military forces , were killed in 2002 , including two who were covering conflict in the west bank .
" while we are encouraged to see the number of deaths decrease this year , journalists are still being targeted and assassinated for doing their jobs , " said cpj executive director ann cooper in a statement accompanying the report .
pearl murder led to introduction of preventative steps the plight of journalists killed in action was headline news in 2002 , mainly because of the abduction and murder of the wall street journal 's south asia reporter daniel pearl in pakistan .
pearl was abducted by activists in karachi in early 2002 and held while his captors demanded the release of pakistani prisoners from the united states military camp in guantanamo bay , cuba .

badly-behaved pupils , an excessive workload and too many government initiatives are damaging morale and pushing more teachers out of the profession , claims the survey .
the chief executive of the general teaching council for england -lrb- gtc -rrb- , carol adams , argues that a new national retention strategy is needed to address the " potentially worrying drift " away from teaching .
her call - at the north of england education conference , in warrington - comes as a poll of some 70,000 teachers across england indicates that 34 % expect to be out of teaching within the next five years .
the findings are based on the 13 % of registered teachers who chose to respond to a questionnaire .
the government says it is taking steps to make the profession a more attractive career .
five-year slide in her speech , ms adams said : " overall , we find too many enthusiastic new teachers , who are mostly young women graduates , fairly rapidly losing their enthusiasm .
" for them , within the first five years , initially positive expectations about what they see as a creative , challenging and rewarding job turn into a wish to move job and a reluctance to say they would choose teaching again .
" we should ask honestly why this happens . "
her remarks draw on the findings of a poll - thought to be the largest of its kind there has been - carried out jointly by the gtc , mori and the guardian newspaper .
the study , conducted during october and november , suggested that the majority -lrb- 64 % -rrb- of teachers would remain in teaching .
survey findings of the 35 % who said they would probably or definitely not be , just over half were due to retire .
a tenth intended to pursue a different career within education - such as being a local education authority adviser or working for an exam board .

badly-behaved pupils , an excessive workload and too many government initiatives are damaging morale and pushing more teachers out of the profession , claims the survey .
the chief executive of the general teaching council for england -lrb- gtc -rrb- , carol adams , argues that a new national retention strategy is needed to address the " potentially worrying drift " away from teaching .
her call - at the north of england education conference , in warrington - comes as a poll of some 70,000 teachers across england indicates that 34 % expect to be out of teaching within the next five years .
the findings are based on the 13 % of registered teachers who chose to respond to a questionnaire .
the government says it is taking steps to make the profession a more attractive career .
five-year slide in her speech , ms adams said : " overall , we find too many enthusiastic new teachers , who are mostly young women graduates , fairly rapidly losing their enthusiasm .
" for them , within the first five years , initially positive expectations about what they see as a creative , challenging and rewarding job turn into a wish to move job and a reluctance to say they would choose teaching again .
" we should ask honestly why this happens . "
her remarks draw on the findings of a poll - thought to be the largest of its kind there has been - carried out jointly by the gtc , mori and the guardian newspaper .
the study , conducted during october and november , suggested that the majority -lrb- 64 % -rrb- of teachers would remain in teaching .
survey findings of the 35 % who said they would probably or definitely not be , just over half were due to retire .
a tenth intended to pursue a different career within education - such as being a local education authority adviser or working for an exam board .
however , more than one in 17 - equivalent to 28,500 teachers nationally - intended to quit the classroom for another job outside education .
that is almost as many as began teacher training courses last autumn .
more than half said their morale was lower than when they began teaching and a third would not teach if they had their time again .

in a speech to british ambassadors in london , tony blair will respond to domestic critics over iraq by insisting that " it is massively in our national interest to remain the closest ally of the united states " .
but he will add : " we should use that alliance to influence them to continue to broaden their agenda . "
mr blair has been facing private criticism from senior colleagues who are worried that britain might back the us in an attack on iraq without clear new evidence or a fresh mandate from the un - something the prime minister has been warned would contravene international law .
more generally , he faces the charge of simply doing whatever washington wants .
' real issues ' in his speech mr blair again attacks anti-americanism , but tacitly acknowledges the criticism . "
i would not commit british troops to a war i thought was wrong or unnecessary " tony blair he will say : " the problem that people have with the us is not that they do n't believe that the weapons of mass destruction and terrorism are not real issues , but that they want to know that the us accepts that other issues , such as the middle east , world poverty and global warming are real issues as well . "
he cites the decision to go through the un over iraq as highly significant .
but it is no good , he argues , to attack the us for going it alone if , when washington asks for help , everyone shuffles to the back of the queue .
" i would not commit british troops to a war i thought was wrong or unnecessary but the price of influence is that you do not leave the us to face the most difficult issues alone , " he will say .
' appalling poverty ' unless action is taken against rogue states , including countries like north korea , " it is only a matter of time before terrorists get their hands on wmd . "
a regime which refuses to disarm despite warnings from the united nations , " threatens us ...
unless the world takes a stand on this issue of wmd we will rue the consequences of our weakness . "
but alongside that hard-line message , mr blair emphasises that in an interdependent world there can be no long-term stability unless the rich countries tackle " the appalling poverty that afflicts a third of the world 's population " and emphasises the importance of reaching out .
he will emphasise also that britain can be " a unifier " - strong in europe and therefore influential with washington , and will repeat his general support for the euro , though not going further than he usually does .

the bedford rowing club says the scheme to create the uk 's first entirely new canal for a century would harm the sport in the town .
the partnership behind the project says it would revitalise the local economy by creating leisure , business and employment opportunities .
but gavin dods , of the 100-year-old rowing club , said the influx of boats in the area could cause crowding .
gavin dods : canal could cause crowding " they 're predicting possibly 4,000 boats are going to be using the canal link , " he said .
" that 's 4,000 people who perhaps are n't used to the river conditions here , who 'll be mooring up in places that are going to be difficult and dangerous for rowers to get round . "
the new 20-mile canal linking the river great ouse at bedford and the grand union canal at milton keynes is due to be built by 2010 .
several routes are under consideration , and the project is expected to cost between £ 80m and £ 150m .
a feasibility study suggested it would create 500 new permanent jobs and generate an extra £ 7m a year for the local economy from visitors .
the scheme is being coordinated by a partnership which includes local councils , british waterways and the bedford and milton keynes waterways trust .

" that 's 4,000 people who perhaps are n't used to the river conditions here , who 'll be mooring up in places that are going to be difficult and dangerous for rowers to get round . "
the new 20-mile canal linking the river great ouse at bedford and the grand union canal at milton keynes is due to be built by 2010 .
several routes are under consideration , and the project is expected to cost between £ 80m and £ 150m .
a feasibility study suggested it would create 500 new permanent jobs and generate an extra £ 7m a year for the local economy from visitors .
the scheme is being coordinated by a partnership which includes local councils , british waterways and the bedford and milton keynes waterways trust .
