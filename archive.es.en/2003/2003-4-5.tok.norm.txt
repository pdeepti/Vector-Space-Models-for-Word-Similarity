more than 100,000 fish were killed in the incident - the cause of which remains a mystery - on the river dee in july 2000 .
the river is one of the most regulated and controlled in britain .
it is important - not just for its beauty or fishing - but as a source of drinking water for nearly three million people in both north wales and england .
the dee is a river which attracts a lot of tourists so the better the health of the river , the better for the local economy environment agency spokesman four thousand fish were released at eccleston ferry outside chester and a further 1,000 were released in farndon on friday .
a spokesman for the environment agency said they had been refilling the river for some time .
" in 2001 we put in 150,000 fish including all different species at various places in the river dee , " he said .
" it is important to refill the river because fish are very good indicators of river water quality , they are sensitive to changes including oxygen depletion .
" the dee is a river which attracts a lot of tourists so the better the health of the river , the better for the local economy . "
scientists still do not know why the fish died nearly three years ago .
the agency said the case " remains a mystery " but it was still open and it was hoped they would discover the cause eventually .

organised by disability sport cymru , the " adapted athletics " event is the culmination of six weeks of taster sessions held by north wales 's county councils for disabled people .
teams from gwynedd , anglesey , conwy , denbighshire , flintshire and wrexham will be competing against each other in the indoor athletics festival at eirias park , colwyn bay , on saturday .
they will take part in running , relay and field events such as shot-put and " foam " javelin throwing .
the competitions will also include the " stand-in long jump " , where the athlete stands by the bar before jumping rather than run towards it . "
it is great to see so many people with disabilities getting involved " nicola tennant , disability sport cymru nicola tennant , the conwy development officer for disability sport cymru , said : " the teams include children young as 11 to 40-year-old adults .
" our job is to try to get young people with disabilities into mainstream athletics clubs , or otherwise encourage the formation of satellite clubs for disabled people . "
although there are some sports clubs in the area set up especially for disabled people , such as a football team in llandudno , ms tennant said it was not as easy to form clubs for disabled people in the north .
she said the population could support clubs in south wales , but not in the north .
" because the population in the north is smaller it means it is more difficult to set up specific clubs for specific disabilities , " said ms tennant .
" but athletics events are for individuals rather than teams , so it is easier for people to get involved . "
however , she said , the aim of the day was to have fun , get people interested and provide links into mainstream clubs .
ms tennant added : " the north wales disability sport cymru development officers have worked hard to get these athletics schemes off the ground .
" it is great to see so many people with disabilities getting involved , along with the coaches and volunteers helping to make events like this happen . "
talent spotting in gwynedd and anglesey , young disabled people have been meeting at the menai track and field club over the past six weeks .
derwyn owen , gwynedd 's disability sports development officer , said he saw the aim of the day as twofold .
" on saturday , we want to find talent and encourage disabled people to go forward with sports , " he said .
" we also want to get as many disabled children as possible involved in sport . "
stacy norcross , denbighshire 's development officer for disability sport cymru , said : " the six weeks have been very successful and only yesterday i got a call asking whether the weekly sessions would carry on after saturday 's festival .
" we have been meeting at prestatyn athletics club for hour-long taster events and we hope to carry on as a group affiliated with a local mainstream club , " she said .
