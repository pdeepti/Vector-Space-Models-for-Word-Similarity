german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .
" i have this beautiful gift for you , " powell announced to peals of laughter .
the lager had been gifted to powell on his last visit to berlin in may because he had once mentioned he missed the old-fashioned , re-saleable bottles , which could be put back in the fridge for later and cooler consumption .

"
the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .
like the 39-year-old guth , marc albrecht , who will conduct " the flying dutchman , " is under 40 and new to bayreuth .
wagner engaged the two men to put on a production at the renowned festival after the two were acclaimed for their world premiere of peter ruzicka 's opera " celan " in dresden in 2001 .
rabble-rousers left and right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief on stage in frankfurt next year , one of germany 's most famous provocateurs , christoph schlingensief , will present his version of " parsifal . "
swiss enfant terrible christoph marthaler will stage " tristan and isolde " in 2005 .
and the controversial danish film director lars von trier , who has enjoyed a career of shocking audiences with his dogma style films , will have his chance to stage " the ring of the nibelungen " in 2006 .
wolfgang wagner and his troop of new faces are n't afraid of creating a stir like patrice chéreau did on the 100th anniversary of the festival with his legendary interpretation of " the ring of the nibelungen . "
chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "
throughout his life richard wagner was dedicated to both art and politics , and his works were often a shock for contemporaneous audiences .
over time he gained a reputation for being a provocateur himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief " it was a strange moment when the phone call came .
i had wished for it for years , " schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
the theater director admitted he was n't an expert on opera .
when it comes to wagner , he said he 's mainly interested in the composer 's political thought and his focus on bringing the divine down to earth .
but schlingensief does n't intend to play the role of rabble-rouser which german audiences have come to expect of him .
instead , he said he just wants to make musical theater .
" music is a command from inside !
it brings the images out of me that were there before they were exposed . "
german theater critics have been regarding the new trend in bayreuth with skepticism and curious anticipation .
the head of the german theater association , klaus zehelein , fears the event will " ultimately lack thought , a concept and a vision . "
but festival director wolfgang wagner does n't have to worry about winning the audience 's favor .

two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy . at a two-day party congress in nuremberg this weekend , the bavarian-based opposition christian social union came out strong behind current state premier edmund stoiber .
with a record vote of 96.97 percent , the party members reinstated the csu chairman in office and gave him a resounding applause for his criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plans for a tax reform .
in a half-hour speech outlining the party ’ s future goals for more involvement on the national level , stoiber attacked what he called the social democrat ’ s " unacceptable " proposals for bringing forward to 2004 a tax cut which was originally planned for 2005 .
stoiber said schröder ’ s plans to finance the tax cut by borrowing five billion euros on credit " only demonstrates the utter incompetence of the government when it comes to finance and tax policies . "
he added , that although the csu and its larger sister party , the christian democratic union , generally supported a tax cut as a means for jump-starting the lagging economy – in fact they had called for such a reform in their last election campaign – it needed to have a solid financial backing otherwise it would end up hurting not helping the country .
stoiber criticized the chancellor for not being up front and honest with the german people and said the federal government should look towards bavaria as a model of good governance .
no blockade politics stoiber ’ s criticism of the current tax reform proposal , however , was coupled with a clear warning to members in the conservative bloc , namely hessen ’ s state premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , not to stand in the way of tax cuts for the simple sake of blocking government reform plans .
" cdu and csu have been and will continue to be a party in favor of lowering taxes , " the csu chairman and last year ’ s opposition chancellor candidate announced in a tacit gibe to koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has repeatedly stated his objections to cutting taxes as a means of boosting the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's state premier roland koch of the cdu .
earlier in the week the premier of hessen was quoted in the bild newspaper as saying he would block chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel ’ s plans for pushing forward a tax break at the expense of mounting debt .
" before we stoop to such financial trickery , as schröder and eichel are devising , let ’ s be honest to the country ’ s citizens and say rather no tax break than one bought on tick , " koch said .
koch ’ s comments were brushed aside by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the cdu , who attended the csu congress as guest speaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman of cdu angela merkel stands next to edmund stoiber of csu .

but my dear friends , what counts is the fact that for all difficult political questions the cdu and the csu have always found a joint solution . "
stoiber echoed his conservative colleague and emphasized the importance of towing one political line on the issue of tax reform .

in a half-hour speech outlining the party ’ s future goals for more involvement on the national level , stoiber attacked what he called the social democrat ’ s " unacceptable " proposals for bringing forward to 2004 a tax cut which was originally planned for 2005 .
stoiber said schröder ’ s plans to finance the tax cut by borrowing five billion euros on credit " only demonstrates the utter incompetence of the government when it comes to finance and tax policies . "
he added , that although the csu and its larger sister party , the christian democratic union , generally supported a tax cut as a means for jump-starting the lagging economy – in fact they had called for such a reform in their last election campaign – it needed to have a solid financial backing otherwise it would end up hurting not helping the country .
stoiber criticized the chancellor for not being up front and honest with the german people and said the federal government should look towards bavaria as a model of good governance .
no blockade politics stoiber ’ s criticism of the current tax reform proposal , however , was coupled with a clear warning to members in the conservative bloc , namely hessen ’ s state premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , not to stand in the way of tax cuts for the simple sake of blocking government reform plans .
" cdu and csu have been and will continue to be a party in favor of lowering taxes , " the csu chairman and last year ’ s opposition chancellor candidate announced in a tacit gibe to koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has repeatedly stated his objections to cutting taxes as a means of boosting the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's state premier roland koch of the cdu .
earlier in the week the premier of hessen was quoted in the bild newspaper as saying he would block chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel ’ s plans for pushing forward a tax break at the expense of mounting debt .
" before we stoop to such financial trickery , as schröder and eichel are devising , let ’ s be honest to the country ’ s citizens and say rather no tax break than one bought on tick , " koch said .
koch ’ s comments were brushed aside by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the cdu , who attended the csu congress as guest speaker .

" we are two different parties , " she said , " and it would be surprising if we didn ’ t occasionally have different nuances , different views and different experiences .
but my dear friends , what counts is the fact that for all difficult political questions the cdu and the csu have always found a joint solution . "
stoiber echoed his conservative colleague and emphasized the importance of towing one political line on the issue of tax reform .
" we can only achieve our goals when we speak with one voice . "
that voice , stoiber hopes , will be his own after the csu secures another victory in bavaria next september , thus bolstering his own position on the federal level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business briefs the chancellor and his finance minister say they will borrow to finance a tax cut designed to stimulate the economy -lrb- july 16 , 2003 -rrb- . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

jan ullrich pulls out the pedal power and races to close the gap between the tour de france ’ s top leader lance armstrong after a victorious sprint on the tour ’ s 12th stage and a strong second place on saturday . " jan is back ! " screamed the headlines of germany ’ s newspapers on saturday .
after a spectacular win in the tour de france time trial on friday brought him to within half a minute of the tour ’ s overall leader , lance armstrong , and a strong second-place showing in the 13th stage narrowed the lead even further , germany ’ s best chance for winning this year ’ s race looks like he ’ s finally back on track .
jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 and since then has more often made headlines for his scandals than sporting feats , was jubilant after finishing the 12th stage of the tour 1 minute and 36 seconds ahead of the four-time tour winner armstrong .
" i am overjoyed , i never expected that .
i just wanted to have a good tour .
now i have a tour win .
i am close to tears , " ullrich was quoted in saturday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" anything is possible , " the triumphant ullrich said after his friday win .
even ullrich ’ s manager wolfgang strohband was surprised with the performance of the bianchi team captain .
" the tour is now wide open again .
i could not believe that he -lsb- ullrich -rsb- could beat armstrong so convincingly , " he told the frankfurt-based newspaper .
closing in on yellow and after coming in second to carlos sastre on the 13th stage on saturday , ullrich ’ s race for victory picked up speed and stamina .
he is now seated in the overall second spot , just 15 seconds away from the coveted yellow jersey currently worn by armstrong .
his chances of holding on to the number two position or even advancing in the next few days look the best they have in a long time .
" i ’ m happy jan wasn ’ t afraid -lsb- on saturday -rsb- and didn ’ t hold back on the attack , " bianchi team coach rudy pevenage said to reporters .
heading into the next three days in the pyrenees , armstrong will have to keep a close eye on ullrich , who has finished the tour second on four occasions .
in the words of die welt , " the showdown is coming in the pyrenees . "

he put on weight and lost several races .
then , after leaving team telekom , ullrich struggled to find his footing with a new team , coast , which disbanded after only a few races due to its inability to pay its cyclists .

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .
" i have this beautiful gift for you , " powell announced to peals of laughter .
the lager had been gifted to powell on his last visit to berlin in may because he had once mentioned he missed the old-fashioned , re-saleable bottles , which could be put back in the fridge for later and cooler consumption .

"
the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .
like the 39-year-old guth , marc albrecht , who will conduct " the flying dutchman , " is under 40 and new to bayreuth .
wagner engaged the two men to put on a production at the renowned festival after the two were acclaimed for their world premiere of peter ruzicka 's opera " celan " in dresden in 2001 .

swiss enfant terrible christoph marthaler will stage " tristan and isolde " in 2005 .
and the controversial danish film director lars von trier , who has enjoyed a career of shocking audiences with his dogma style films , will have his chance to stage " the ring of the nibelungen " in 2006 .
wolfgang wagner and his troop of new faces are n't afraid of creating a stir like patrice chéreau did on the 100th anniversary of the festival with his legendary interpretation of " the ring of the nibelungen . "
chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "
throughout his life richard wagner was dedicated to both art and politics , and his works were often a shock for contemporaneous audiences .
over time he gained a reputation for being a provocateur himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief " it was a strange moment when the phone call came .
i had wished for it for years , " schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
the theater director admitted he was n't an expert on opera .
when it comes to wagner , he said he 's mainly interested in the composer 's political thought and his focus on bringing the divine down to earth .
but schlingensief does n't intend to play the role of rabble-rouser which german audiences have come to expect of him .
instead , he said he just wants to make musical theater .
" music is a command from inside !
it brings the images out of me that were there before they were exposed . "
german theater critics have been regarding the new trend in bayreuth with skepticism and curious anticipation .
the head of the german theater association , klaus zehelein , fears the event will " ultimately lack thought , a concept and a vision . "

two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy . at a two-day party congress in nuremberg this weekend , the bavarian-based opposition christian social union came out strong behind current state premier edmund stoiber .
with a record vote of 96.97 percent , the party members reinstated the csu chairman in office and gave him a resounding applause for his criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plans for a tax reform .
in a half-hour speech outlining the party ’ s future goals for more involvement on the national level , stoiber attacked what he called the social democrat ’ s " unacceptable " proposals for bringing forward to 2004 a tax cut which was originally planned for 2005 .
stoiber said schröder ’ s plans to finance the tax cut by borrowing five billion euros on credit " only demonstrates the utter incompetence of the government when it comes to finance and tax policies . "
he added , that although the csu and its larger sister party , the christian democratic union , generally supported a tax cut as a means for jump-starting the lagging economy – in fact they had called for such a reform in their last election campaign – it needed to have a solid financial backing otherwise it would end up hurting not helping the country .
stoiber criticized the chancellor for not being up front and honest with the german people and said the federal government should look towards bavaria as a model of good governance .
no blockade politics stoiber ’ s criticism of the current tax reform proposal , however , was coupled with a clear warning to members in the conservative bloc , namely hessen ’ s state premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , not to stand in the way of tax cuts for the simple sake of blocking government reform plans .
" cdu and csu have been and will continue to be a party in favor of lowering taxes , " the csu chairman and last year ’ s opposition chancellor candidate announced in a tacit gibe to koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has repeatedly stated his objections to cutting taxes as a means of boosting the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's state premier roland koch of the cdu .
earlier in the week the premier of hessen was quoted in the bild newspaper as saying he would block chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel ’ s plans for pushing forward a tax break at the expense of mounting debt .
" before we stoop to such financial trickery , as schröder and eichel are devising , let ’ s be honest to the country ’ s citizens and say rather no tax break than one bought on tick , " koch said .
koch ’ s comments were brushed aside by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the cdu , who attended the csu congress as guest speaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman of cdu angela merkel stands next to edmund stoiber of csu .
" we are two different parties , " she said , " and it would be surprising if we didn ’ t occasionally have different nuances , different views and different experiences .
but my dear friends , what counts is the fact that for all difficult political questions the cdu and the csu have always found a joint solution . "
stoiber echoed his conservative colleague and emphasized the importance of towing one political line on the issue of tax reform .
" we can only achieve our goals when we speak with one voice . "
that voice , stoiber hopes , will be his own after the csu secures another victory in bavaria next september , thus bolstering his own position on the federal level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business briefs the chancellor and his finance minister say they will borrow to finance a tax cut designed to stimulate the economy -lrb- july 16 , 2003 -rrb- .

no blockade politics stoiber ’ s criticism of the current tax reform proposal , however , was coupled with a clear warning to members in the conservative bloc , namely hessen ’ s state premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , not to stand in the way of tax cuts for the simple sake of blocking government reform plans .
" cdu and csu have been and will continue to be a party in favor of lowering taxes , " the csu chairman and last year ’ s opposition chancellor candidate announced in a tacit gibe to koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has repeatedly stated his objections to cutting taxes as a means of boosting the economy .

earlier in the week the premier of hessen was quoted in the bild newspaper as saying he would block chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel ’ s plans for pushing forward a tax break at the expense of mounting debt .
" before we stoop to such financial trickery , as schröder and eichel are devising , let ’ s be honest to the country ’ s citizens and say rather no tax break than one bought on tick , " koch said .
koch ’ s comments were brushed aside by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the cdu , who attended the csu congress as guest speaker .

" we are two different parties , " she said , " and it would be surprising if we didn ’ t occasionally have different nuances , different views and different experiences .
but my dear friends , what counts is the fact that for all difficult political questions the cdu and the csu have always found a joint solution . "
stoiber echoed his conservative colleague and emphasized the importance of towing one political line on the issue of tax reform .
" we can only achieve our goals when we speak with one voice . "
that voice , stoiber hopes , will be his own after the csu secures another victory in bavaria next september , thus bolstering his own position on the federal level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business briefs the chancellor and his finance minister say they will borrow to finance a tax cut designed to stimulate the economy -lrb- july 16 , 2003 -rrb- .

jan ullrich pulls out the pedal power and races to close the gap between the tour de france ’ s top leader lance armstrong after a victorious sprint on the tour ’ s 12th stage and a strong second place on saturday . " jan is back ! " screamed the headlines of germany ’ s newspapers on saturday .
after a spectacular win in the tour de france time trial on friday brought him to within half a minute of the tour ’ s overall leader , lance armstrong , and a strong second-place showing in the 13th stage narrowed the lead even further , germany ’ s best chance for winning this year ’ s race looks like he ’ s finally back on track .
jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 and since then has more often made headlines for his scandals than sporting feats , was jubilant after finishing the 12th stage of the tour 1 minute and 36 seconds ahead of the four-time tour winner armstrong .
" i am overjoyed , i never expected that .
i just wanted to have a good tour .
now i have a tour win .
i am close to tears , " ullrich was quoted in saturday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" anything is possible , " the triumphant ullrich said after his friday win .
even ullrich ’ s manager wolfgang strohband was surprised with the performance of the bianchi team captain .
" the tour is now wide open again .
i could not believe that he -lsb- ullrich -rsb- could beat armstrong so convincingly , " he told the frankfurt-based newspaper .
closing in on yellow and after coming in second to carlos sastre on the 13th stage on saturday , ullrich ’ s race for victory picked up speed and stamina .
he is now seated in the overall second spot , just 15 seconds away from the coveted yellow jersey currently worn by armstrong .
his chances of holding on to the number two position or even advancing in the next few days look the best they have in a long time .
" i ’ m happy jan wasn ’ t afraid -lsb- on saturday -rsb- and didn ’ t hold back on the attack , " bianchi team coach rudy pevenage said to reporters .
heading into the next three days in the pyrenees , armstrong will have to keep a close eye on ullrich , who has finished the tour second on four occasions .
in the words of die welt , " the showdown is coming in the pyrenees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has returned to the tour de france a winner .
jan ’ s comeback a year ago ullrich didn ’ t look like he could muster up the strength to challenge armstrong .
his career had hit rock bottom after a doping ban for ecstasy and a reoccurring knee injury sidelined him for months and forced him out of last year ’ s tour competition .
he then began racking up strikes against his name for wild partying and traffic violations .
he put on weight and lost several races .
then , after leaving team telekom , ullrich struggled to find his footing with a new team , coast , which disbanded after only a few races due to its inability to pay its cyclists .
" he was a crashed hero a year ago , " wrote bild newspaper columnist matthias brügelmann on saturday .
" he had disappeared , was a nobody .
he could have retired altogether , relaxed with the millions he had made . "
but ullrich was already working on his comeback .
in may , he switched to the mint-green jersey of the italian bicycle manufacture bianchi and has worked hard to get himself back in shape .
in june he put in a good fifth place showing at the deutschland tour , but fell far short of what the rostock-born cyclist knew he was capable of doing .
friday ’ s victory in the 47-kilometer time trial at cap decouverte and his rapid closing in on armstrong on saturday now proves germany ’ s cycling hero has returned and that he is ready to go head-to-head with armstrong .

two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy . at a two-day party congress in nuremberg this weekend , the bavarian-based opposition christian social union came out strong behind current state premier edmund stoiber .
with a record vote of 96.97 percent , the party members reinstated the csu chairman in office and gave him a resounding applause for his criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plans for a tax reform .
in a half-hour speech outlining the party ’ s future goals for more involvement on the national level , stoiber attacked what he called the social democrat ’ s " unacceptable " proposals for bringing forward to 2004 a tax cut which was originally planned for 2005 .
stoiber said schröder ’ s plans to finance the tax cut by borrowing five billion euros on credit " only demonstrates the utter incompetence of the government when it comes to finance and tax policies . "
he added , that although the csu and its larger sister party , the christian democratic union , generally supported a tax cut as a means for jump-starting the lagging economy – in fact they had called for such a reform in their last election campaign – it needed to have a solid financial backing otherwise it would end up hurting not helping the country .

jan ullrich pulls out the pedal power and races to close the gap between the tour de france ’ s top leader lance armstrong after a victorious sprint on the tour ’ s 12th stage and a strong second place on saturday . " jan is back ! " screamed the headlines of germany ’ s newspapers on saturday .
after a spectacular win in the tour de france time trial on friday brought him to within half a minute of the tour ’ s overall leader , lance armstrong , and a strong second-place showing in the 13th stage narrowed the lead even further , germany ’ s best chance for winning this year ’ s race looks like he ’ s finally back on track .
jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 and since then has more often made headlines for his scandals than sporting feats , was jubilant after finishing the 12th stage of the tour 1 minute and 36 seconds ahead of the four-time tour winner armstrong .
" i am overjoyed , i never expected that .
i just wanted to have a good tour .
now i have a tour win .
i am close to tears , " ullrich was quoted in saturday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" anything is possible , " the triumphant ullrich said after his friday win .
even ullrich ’ s manager wolfgang strohband was surprised with the performance of the bianchi team captain .
" the tour is now wide open again .
i could not believe that he -lsb- ullrich -rsb- could beat armstrong so convincingly , " he told the frankfurt-based newspaper .
closing in on yellow and after coming in second to carlos sastre on the 13th stage on saturday , ullrich ’ s race for victory picked up speed and stamina .
he is now seated in the overall second spot , just 15 seconds away from the coveted yellow jersey currently worn by armstrong .
his chances of holding on to the number two position or even advancing in the next few days look the best they have in a long time .
" i ’ m happy jan wasn ’ t afraid -lsb- on saturday -rsb- and didn ’ t hold back on the attack , " bianchi team coach rudy pevenage said to reporters .
heading into the next three days in the pyrenees , armstrong will have to keep a close eye on ullrich , who has finished the tour second on four occasions .
in the words of die welt , " the showdown is coming in the pyrenees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has returned to the tour de france a winner .
jan ’ s comeback a year ago ullrich didn ’ t look like he could muster up the strength to challenge armstrong .
his career had hit rock bottom after a doping ban for ecstasy and a reoccurring knee injury sidelined him for months and forced him out of last year ’ s tour competition .
he then began racking up strikes against his name for wild partying and traffic violations .
he put on weight and lost several races .
then , after leaving team telekom , ullrich struggled to find his footing with a new team , coast , which disbanded after only a few races due to its inability to pay its cyclists .
" he was a crashed hero a year ago , " wrote bild newspaper columnist matthias brügelmann on saturday .
" he had disappeared , was a nobody .
he could have retired altogether , relaxed with the millions he had made . "
but ullrich was already working on his comeback .
in may , he switched to the mint-green jersey of the italian bicycle manufacture bianchi and has worked hard to get himself back in shape .
in june he put in a good fifth place showing at the deutschland tour , but fell far short of what the rostock-born cyclist knew he was capable of doing .
friday ’ s victory in the 47-kilometer time trial at cap decouverte and his rapid closing in on armstrong on saturday now proves germany ’ s cycling hero has returned and that he is ready to go head-to-head with armstrong .

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .
" i have this beautiful gift for you , " powell announced to peals of laughter .
the lager had been gifted to powell on his last visit to berlin in may because he had once mentioned he missed the old-fashioned , re-saleable bottles , which could be put back in the fridge for later and cooler consumption .
" talk about a knack for ice-breaking diplomacy , " he quipped . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer offers diplomacy lesson during his visit to the united states this week , joschka fischer sought to show that germany and the u.s. have reconciled .

two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy . at a two-day party congress in nuremberg this weekend , the bavarian-based opposition christian social union came out strong behind current state premier edmund stoiber .
with a record vote of 96.97 percent , the party members reinstated the csu chairman in office and gave him a resounding applause for his criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plans for a tax reform .
in a half-hour speech outlining the party ’ s future goals for more involvement on the national level , stoiber attacked what he called the social democrat ’ s " unacceptable " proposals for bringing forward to 2004 a tax cut which was originally planned for 2005 .
stoiber said schröder ’ s plans to finance the tax cut by borrowing five billion euros on credit " only demonstrates the utter incompetence of the government when it comes to finance and tax policies . "
he added , that although the csu and its larger sister party , the christian democratic union , generally supported a tax cut as a means for jump-starting the lagging economy – in fact they had called for such a reform in their last election campaign – it needed to have a solid financial backing otherwise it would end up hurting not helping the country .
stoiber criticized the chancellor for not being up front and honest with the german people and said the federal government should look towards bavaria as a model of good governance .
no blockade politics stoiber ’ s criticism of the current tax reform proposal , however , was coupled with a clear warning to members in the conservative bloc , namely hessen ’ s state premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , not to stand in the way of tax cuts for the simple sake of blocking government reform plans .
" cdu and csu have been and will continue to be a party in favor of lowering taxes , " the csu chairman and last year ’ s opposition chancellor candidate announced in a tacit gibe to koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has repeatedly stated his objections to cutting taxes as a means of boosting the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's state premier roland koch of the cdu .
earlier in the week the premier of hessen was quoted in the bild newspaper as saying he would block chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel ’ s plans for pushing forward a tax break at the expense of mounting debt .
" before we stoop to such financial trickery , as schröder and eichel are devising , let ’ s be honest to the country ’ s citizens and say rather no tax break than one bought on tick , " koch said .
koch ’ s comments were brushed aside by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the cdu , who attended the csu congress as guest speaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman of cdu angela merkel stands next to edmund stoiber of csu .
" we are two different parties , " she said , " and it would be surprising if we didn ’ t occasionally have different nuances , different views and different experiences .
but my dear friends , what counts is the fact that for all difficult political questions the cdu and the csu have always found a joint solution . "
stoiber echoed his conservative colleague and emphasized the importance of towing one political line on the issue of tax reform .
" we can only achieve our goals when we speak with one voice . "
that voice , stoiber hopes , will be his own after the csu secures another victory in bavaria next september , thus bolstering his own position on the federal level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business briefs the chancellor and his finance minister say they will borrow to finance a tax cut designed to stimulate the economy -lrb- july 16 , 2003 -rrb- .

"
the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .
like the 39-year-old guth , marc albrecht , who will conduct " the flying dutchman , " is under 40 and new to bayreuth .
wagner engaged the two men to put on a production at the renowned festival after the two were acclaimed for their world premiere of peter ruzicka 's opera " celan " in dresden in 2001 .
rabble-rousers left and right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief on stage in frankfurt next year , one of germany 's most famous provocateurs , christoph schlingensief , will present his version of " parsifal . "
swiss enfant terrible christoph marthaler will stage " tristan and isolde " in 2005 .
and the controversial danish film director lars von trier , who has enjoyed a career of shocking audiences with his dogma style films , will have his chance to stage " the ring of the nibelungen " in 2006 .
wolfgang wagner and his troop of new faces are n't afraid of creating a stir like patrice chéreau did on the 100th anniversary of the festival with his legendary interpretation of " the ring of the nibelungen . "
chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "
throughout his life richard wagner was dedicated to both art and politics , and his works were often a shock for contemporaneous audiences .

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .
" i have this beautiful gift for you , " powell announced to peals of laughter .
the lager had been gifted to powell on his last visit to berlin in may because he had once mentioned he missed the old-fashioned , re-saleable bottles , which could be put back in the fridge for later and cooler consumption .
" talk about a knack for ice-breaking diplomacy , " he quipped . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer offers diplomacy lesson during his visit to the united states this week , joschka fischer sought to show that germany and the u.s. have reconciled .

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .

"
the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .
like the 39-year-old guth , marc albrecht , who will conduct " the flying dutchman , " is under 40 and new to bayreuth .
wagner engaged the two men to put on a production at the renowned festival after the two were acclaimed for their world premiere of peter ruzicka 's opera " celan " in dresden in 2001 .
rabble-rousers left and right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief on stage in frankfurt next year , one of germany 's most famous provocateurs , christoph schlingensief , will present his version of " parsifal . "
swiss enfant terrible christoph marthaler will stage " tristan and isolde " in 2005 .
and the controversial danish film director lars von trier , who has enjoyed a career of shocking audiences with his dogma style films , will have his chance to stage " the ring of the nibelungen " in 2006 .
wolfgang wagner and his troop of new faces are n't afraid of creating a stir like patrice chéreau did on the 100th anniversary of the festival with his legendary interpretation of " the ring of the nibelungen . "
chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "
throughout his life richard wagner was dedicated to both art and politics , and his works were often a shock for contemporaneous audiences .
over time he gained a reputation for being a provocateur himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief " it was a strange moment when the phone call came .
i had wished for it for years , " schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
the theater director admitted he was n't an expert on opera .
when it comes to wagner , he said he 's mainly interested in the composer 's political thought and his focus on bringing the divine down to earth .
but schlingensief does n't intend to play the role of rabble-rouser which german audiences have come to expect of him .
instead , he said he just wants to make musical theater .
" music is a command from inside !
it brings the images out of me that were there before they were exposed . "
german theater critics have been regarding the new trend in bayreuth with skepticism and curious anticipation .
the head of the german theater association , klaus zehelein , fears the event will " ultimately lack thought , a concept and a vision . "
but festival director wolfgang wagner does n't have to worry about winning the audience 's favor .

rabble-rousers left and right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief on stage in frankfurt next year , one of germany 's most famous provocateurs , christoph schlingensief , will present his version of " parsifal . "
swiss enfant terrible christoph marthaler will stage " tristan and isolde " in 2005 .
and the controversial danish film director lars von trier , who has enjoyed a career of shocking audiences with his dogma style films , will have his chance to stage " the ring of the nibelungen " in 2006 .
wolfgang wagner and his troop of new faces are n't afraid of creating a stir like patrice chéreau did on the 100th anniversary of the festival with his legendary interpretation of " the ring of the nibelungen . "
chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "
throughout his life richard wagner was dedicated to both art and politics , and his works were often a shock for contemporaneous audiences .
over time he gained a reputation for being a provocateur himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief " it was a strange moment when the phone call came .
i had wished for it for years , " schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
the theater director admitted he was n't an expert on opera .
when it comes to wagner , he said he 's mainly interested in the composer 's political thought and his focus on bringing the divine down to earth .
but schlingensief does n't intend to play the role of rabble-rouser which german audiences have come to expect of him .
instead , he said he just wants to make musical theater .
" music is a command from inside !
it brings the images out of me that were there before they were exposed . "
german theater critics have been regarding the new trend in bayreuth with skepticism and curious anticipation .
the head of the german theater association , klaus zehelein , fears the event will " ultimately lack thought , a concept and a vision . "
but festival director wolfgang wagner does n't have to worry about winning the audience 's favor .

jan ullrich pulls out the pedal power and races to close the gap between the tour de france ’ s top leader lance armstrong after a victorious sprint on the tour ’ s 12th stage and a strong second place on saturday . " jan is back ! " screamed the headlines of germany ’ s newspapers on saturday .
after a spectacular win in the tour de france time trial on friday brought him to within half a minute of the tour ’ s overall leader , lance armstrong , and a strong second-place showing in the 13th stage narrowed the lead even further , germany ’ s best chance for winning this year ’ s race looks like he ’ s finally back on track .
jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 and since then has more often made headlines for his scandals than sporting feats , was jubilant after finishing the 12th stage of the tour 1 minute and 36 seconds ahead of the four-time tour winner armstrong .
" i am overjoyed , i never expected that .
i just wanted to have a good tour .
now i have a tour win .
i am close to tears , " ullrich was quoted in saturday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" anything is possible , " the triumphant ullrich said after his friday win .
even ullrich ’ s manager wolfgang strohband was surprised with the performance of the bianchi team captain .
" the tour is now wide open again .
i could not believe that he -lsb- ullrich -rsb- could beat armstrong so convincingly , " he told the frankfurt-based newspaper .
closing in on yellow and after coming in second to carlos sastre on the 13th stage on saturday , ullrich ’ s race for victory picked up speed and stamina .
he is now seated in the overall second spot , just 15 seconds away from the coveted yellow jersey currently worn by armstrong .
his chances of holding on to the number two position or even advancing in the next few days look the best they have in a long time .
" i ’ m happy jan wasn ’ t afraid -lsb- on saturday -rsb- and didn ’ t hold back on the attack , " bianchi team coach rudy pevenage said to reporters .
heading into the next three days in the pyrenees , armstrong will have to keep a close eye on ullrich , who has finished the tour second on four occasions .
in the words of die welt , " the showdown is coming in the pyrenees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has returned to the tour de france a winner .
jan ’ s comeback a year ago ullrich didn ’ t look like he could muster up the strength to challenge armstrong .
his career had hit rock bottom after a doping ban for ecstasy and a reoccurring knee injury sidelined him for months and forced him out of last year ’ s tour competition .
he then began racking up strikes against his name for wild partying and traffic violations .
he put on weight and lost several races .
then , after leaving team telekom , ullrich struggled to find his footing with a new team , coast , which disbanded after only a few races due to its inability to pay its cyclists .
" he was a crashed hero a year ago , " wrote bild newspaper columnist matthias brügelmann on saturday .
" he had disappeared , was a nobody .
he could have retired altogether , relaxed with the millions he had made . "
but ullrich was already working on his comeback .
in may , he switched to the mint-green jersey of the italian bicycle manufacture bianchi and has worked hard to get himself back in shape .
in june he put in a good fifth place showing at the deutschland tour , but fell far short of what the rostock-born cyclist knew he was capable of doing .
friday ’ s victory in the 47-kilometer time trial at cap decouverte and his rapid closing in on armstrong on saturday now proves germany ’ s cycling hero has returned and that he is ready to go head-to-head with armstrong .

two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy . at a two-day party congress in nuremberg this weekend , the bavarian-based opposition christian social union came out strong behind current state premier edmund stoiber .
with a record vote of 96.97 percent , the party members reinstated the csu chairman in office and gave him a resounding applause for his criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plans for a tax reform .
in a half-hour speech outlining the party ’ s future goals for more involvement on the national level , stoiber attacked what he called the social democrat ’ s " unacceptable " proposals for bringing forward to 2004 a tax cut which was originally planned for 2005 .
stoiber said schröder ’ s plans to finance the tax cut by borrowing five billion euros on credit " only demonstrates the utter incompetence of the government when it comes to finance and tax policies . "
he added , that although the csu and its larger sister party , the christian democratic union , generally supported a tax cut as a means for jump-starting the lagging economy – in fact they had called for such a reform in their last election campaign – it needed to have a solid financial backing otherwise it would end up hurting not helping the country .
stoiber criticized the chancellor for not being up front and honest with the german people and said the federal government should look towards bavaria as a model of good governance .
no blockade politics stoiber ’ s criticism of the current tax reform proposal , however , was coupled with a clear warning to members in the conservative bloc , namely hessen ’ s state premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , not to stand in the way of tax cuts for the simple sake of blocking government reform plans .
" cdu and csu have been and will continue to be a party in favor of lowering taxes , " the csu chairman and last year ’ s opposition chancellor candidate announced in a tacit gibe to koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has repeatedly stated his objections to cutting taxes as a means of boosting the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's state premier roland koch of the cdu .
earlier in the week the premier of hessen was quoted in the bild newspaper as saying he would block chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel ’ s plans for pushing forward a tax break at the expense of mounting debt .
" before we stoop to such financial trickery , as schröder and eichel are devising , let ’ s be honest to the country ’ s citizens and say rather no tax break than one bought on tick , " koch said .
koch ’ s comments were brushed aside by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the cdu , who attended the csu congress as guest speaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman of cdu angela merkel stands next to edmund stoiber of csu .
" we are two different parties , " she said , " and it would be surprising if we didn ’ t occasionally have different nuances , different views and different experiences .
but my dear friends , what counts is the fact that for all difficult political questions the cdu and the csu have always found a joint solution . "
stoiber echoed his conservative colleague and emphasized the importance of towing one political line on the issue of tax reform .
" we can only achieve our goals when we speak with one voice . "
that voice , stoiber hopes , will be his own after the csu secures another victory in bavaria next september , thus bolstering his own position on the federal level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business briefs the chancellor and his finance minister say they will borrow to finance a tax cut designed to stimulate the economy -lrb- july 16 , 2003 -rrb- .

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .
" i have this beautiful gift for you , " powell announced to peals of laughter .
the lager had been gifted to powell on his last visit to berlin in may because he had once mentioned he missed the old-fashioned , re-saleable bottles , which could be put back in the fridge for later and cooler consumption .

jan ullrich pulls out the pedal power and races to close the gap between the tour de france ’ s top leader lance armstrong after a victorious sprint on the tour ’ s 12th stage and a strong second place on saturday . " jan is back ! " screamed the headlines of germany ’ s newspapers on saturday .
after a spectacular win in the tour de france time trial on friday brought him to within half a minute of the tour ’ s overall leader , lance armstrong , and a strong second-place showing in the 13th stage narrowed the lead even further , germany ’ s best chance for winning this year ’ s race looks like he ’ s finally back on track .
jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 and since then has more often made headlines for his scandals than sporting feats , was jubilant after finishing the 12th stage of the tour 1 minute and 36 seconds ahead of the four-time tour winner armstrong .
" i am overjoyed , i never expected that .
i just wanted to have a good tour .
now i have a tour win .
i am close to tears , " ullrich was quoted in saturday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" anything is possible , " the triumphant ullrich said after his friday win .
even ullrich ’ s manager wolfgang strohband was surprised with the performance of the bianchi team captain .
" the tour is now wide open again .
i could not believe that he -lsb- ullrich -rsb- could beat armstrong so convincingly , " he told the frankfurt-based newspaper .
closing in on yellow and after coming in second to carlos sastre on the 13th stage on saturday , ullrich ’ s race for victory picked up speed and stamina .
he is now seated in the overall second spot , just 15 seconds away from the coveted yellow jersey currently worn by armstrong .
his chances of holding on to the number two position or even advancing in the next few days look the best they have in a long time .
" i ’ m happy jan wasn ’ t afraid -lsb- on saturday -rsb- and didn ’ t hold back on the attack , " bianchi team coach rudy pevenage said to reporters .
heading into the next three days in the pyrenees , armstrong will have to keep a close eye on ullrich , who has finished the tour second on four occasions .
in the words of die welt , " the showdown is coming in the pyrenees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has returned to the tour de france a winner .
jan ’ s comeback a year ago ullrich didn ’ t look like he could muster up the strength to challenge armstrong .
his career had hit rock bottom after a doping ban for ecstasy and a reoccurring knee injury sidelined him for months and forced him out of last year ’ s tour competition .
he then began racking up strikes against his name for wild partying and traffic violations .
he put on weight and lost several races .
then , after leaving team telekom , ullrich struggled to find his footing with a new team , coast , which disbanded after only a few races due to its inability to pay its cyclists .
" he was a crashed hero a year ago , " wrote bild newspaper columnist matthias brügelmann on saturday .
" he had disappeared , was a nobody .
he could have retired altogether , relaxed with the millions he had made . "
but ullrich was already working on his comeback .
in may , he switched to the mint-green jersey of the italian bicycle manufacture bianchi and has worked hard to get himself back in shape .
in june he put in a good fifth place showing at the deutschland tour , but fell far short of what the rostock-born cyclist knew he was capable of doing .
friday ’ s victory in the 47-kilometer time trial at cap decouverte and his rapid closing in on armstrong on saturday now proves germany ’ s cycling hero has returned and that he is ready to go head-to-head with armstrong .

two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy . at a two-day party congress in nuremberg this weekend , the bavarian-based opposition christian social union came out strong behind current state premier edmund stoiber .
with a record vote of 96.97 percent , the party members reinstated the csu chairman in office and gave him a resounding applause for his criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plans for a tax reform .
in a half-hour speech outlining the party ’ s future goals for more involvement on the national level , stoiber attacked what he called the social democrat ’ s " unacceptable " proposals for bringing forward to 2004 a tax cut which was originally planned for 2005 .
stoiber said schröder ’ s plans to finance the tax cut by borrowing five billion euros on credit " only demonstrates the utter incompetence of the government when it comes to finance and tax policies . "
he added , that although the csu and its larger sister party , the christian democratic union , generally supported a tax cut as a means for jump-starting the lagging economy – in fact they had called for such a reform in their last election campaign – it needed to have a solid financial backing otherwise it would end up hurting not helping the country .
stoiber criticized the chancellor for not being up front and honest with the german people and said the federal government should look towards bavaria as a model of good governance .
no blockade politics stoiber ’ s criticism of the current tax reform proposal , however , was coupled with a clear warning to members in the conservative bloc , namely hessen ’ s state premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , not to stand in the way of tax cuts for the simple sake of blocking government reform plans .
" cdu and csu have been and will continue to be a party in favor of lowering taxes , " the csu chairman and last year ’ s opposition chancellor candidate announced in a tacit gibe to koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has repeatedly stated his objections to cutting taxes as a means of boosting the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's state premier roland koch of the cdu .
earlier in the week the premier of hessen was quoted in the bild newspaper as saying he would block chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel ’ s plans for pushing forward a tax break at the expense of mounting debt .
" before we stoop to such financial trickery , as schröder and eichel are devising , let ’ s be honest to the country ’ s citizens and say rather no tax break than one bought on tick , " koch said .
koch ’ s comments were brushed aside by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the cdu , who attended the csu congress as guest speaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman of cdu angela merkel stands next to edmund stoiber of csu .
" we are two different parties , " she said , " and it would be surprising if we didn ’ t occasionally have different nuances , different views and different experiences .
but my dear friends , what counts is the fact that for all difficult political questions the cdu and the csu have always found a joint solution . "
stoiber echoed his conservative colleague and emphasized the importance of towing one political line on the issue of tax reform .
" we can only achieve our goals when we speak with one voice . "

"
the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .
like the 39-year-old guth , marc albrecht , who will conduct " the flying dutchman , " is under 40 and new to bayreuth .
wagner engaged the two men to put on a production at the renowned festival after the two were acclaimed for their world premiere of peter ruzicka 's opera " celan " in dresden in 2001 .
rabble-rousers left and right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief on stage in frankfurt next year , one of germany 's most famous provocateurs , christoph schlingensief , will present his version of " parsifal . "
swiss enfant terrible christoph marthaler will stage " tristan and isolde " in 2005 .
and the controversial danish film director lars von trier , who has enjoyed a career of shocking audiences with his dogma style films , will have his chance to stage " the ring of the nibelungen " in 2006 .
wolfgang wagner and his troop of new faces are n't afraid of creating a stir like patrice chéreau did on the 100th anniversary of the festival with his legendary interpretation of " the ring of the nibelungen . "
chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "
throughout his life richard wagner was dedicated to both art and politics , and his works were often a shock for contemporaneous audiences .
over time he gained a reputation for being a provocateur himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief " it was a strange moment when the phone call came .
i had wished for it for years , " schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
the theater director admitted he was n't an expert on opera .
when it comes to wagner , he said he 's mainly interested in the composer 's political thought and his focus on bringing the divine down to earth .
but schlingensief does n't intend to play the role of rabble-rouser which german audiences have come to expect of him .
instead , he said he just wants to make musical theater .
" music is a command from inside !
it brings the images out of me that were there before they were exposed . "
german theater critics have been regarding the new trend in bayreuth with skepticism and curious anticipation .
the head of the german theater association , klaus zehelein , fears the event will " ultimately lack thought , a concept and a vision . "
but festival director wolfgang wagner does n't have to worry about winning the audience 's favor .

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .
" i have this beautiful gift for you , " powell announced to peals of laughter .
the lager had been gifted to powell on his last visit to berlin in may because he had once mentioned he missed the old-fashioned , re-saleable bottles , which could be put back in the fridge for later and cooler consumption .

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .
" i have this beautiful gift for you , " powell announced to peals of laughter .
the lager had been gifted to powell on his last visit to berlin in may because he had once mentioned he missed the old-fashioned , re-saleable bottles , which could be put back in the fridge for later and cooler consumption .

the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .

chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "

"
the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .
like the 39-year-old guth , marc albrecht , who will conduct " the flying dutchman , " is under 40 and new to bayreuth .
wagner engaged the two men to put on a production at the renowned festival after the two were acclaimed for their world premiere of peter ruzicka 's opera " celan " in dresden in 2001 .
rabble-rousers left and right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief on stage in frankfurt next year , one of germany 's most famous provocateurs , christoph schlingensief , will present his version of " parsifal . "
swiss enfant terrible christoph marthaler will stage " tristan and isolde " in 2005 .
and the controversial danish film director lars von trier , who has enjoyed a career of shocking audiences with his dogma style films , will have his chance to stage " the ring of the nibelungen " in 2006 .
wolfgang wagner and his troop of new faces are n't afraid of creating a stir like patrice chéreau did on the 100th anniversary of the festival with his legendary interpretation of " the ring of the nibelungen . "
chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "
throughout his life richard wagner was dedicated to both art and politics , and his works were often a shock for contemporaneous audiences .
over time he gained a reputation for being a provocateur himself .

jan ullrich pulls out the pedal power and races to close the gap between the tour de france ’ s top leader lance armstrong after a victorious sprint on the tour ’ s 12th stage and a strong second place on saturday . " jan is back ! " screamed the headlines of germany ’ s newspapers on saturday .
after a spectacular win in the tour de france time trial on friday brought him to within half a minute of the tour ’ s overall leader , lance armstrong , and a strong second-place showing in the 13th stage narrowed the lead even further , germany ’ s best chance for winning this year ’ s race looks like he ’ s finally back on track .
jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 and since then has more often made headlines for his scandals than sporting feats , was jubilant after finishing the 12th stage of the tour 1 minute and 36 seconds ahead of the four-time tour winner armstrong .
" i am overjoyed , i never expected that .
i just wanted to have a good tour .
now i have a tour win .
i am close to tears , " ullrich was quoted in saturday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" anything is possible , " the triumphant ullrich said after his friday win .
even ullrich ’ s manager wolfgang strohband was surprised with the performance of the bianchi team captain .
" the tour is now wide open again .
i could not believe that he -lsb- ullrich -rsb- could beat armstrong so convincingly , " he told the frankfurt-based newspaper .
closing in on yellow and after coming in second to carlos sastre on the 13th stage on saturday , ullrich ’ s race for victory picked up speed and stamina .
he is now seated in the overall second spot , just 15 seconds away from the coveted yellow jersey currently worn by armstrong .
his chances of holding on to the number two position or even advancing in the next few days look the best they have in a long time .
" i ’ m happy jan wasn ’ t afraid -lsb- on saturday -rsb- and didn ’ t hold back on the attack , " bianchi team coach rudy pevenage said to reporters .
heading into the next three days in the pyrenees , armstrong will have to keep a close eye on ullrich , who has finished the tour second on four occasions .
in the words of die welt , " the showdown is coming in the pyrenees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has returned to the tour de france a winner .
jan ’ s comeback a year ago ullrich didn ’ t look like he could muster up the strength to challenge armstrong .
his career had hit rock bottom after a doping ban for ecstasy and a reoccurring knee injury sidelined him for months and forced him out of last year ’ s tour competition .
he then began racking up strikes against his name for wild partying and traffic violations .
he put on weight and lost several races .
then , after leaving team telekom , ullrich struggled to find his footing with a new team , coast , which disbanded after only a few races due to its inability to pay its cyclists .
" he was a crashed hero a year ago , " wrote bild newspaper columnist matthias brügelmann on saturday .
" he had disappeared , was a nobody .
he could have retired altogether , relaxed with the millions he had made . "
but ullrich was already working on his comeback .
in may , he switched to the mint-green jersey of the italian bicycle manufacture bianchi and has worked hard to get himself back in shape .
in june he put in a good fifth place showing at the deutschland tour , but fell far short of what the rostock-born cyclist knew he was capable of doing .
friday ’ s victory in the 47-kilometer time trial at cap decouverte and his rapid closing in on armstrong on saturday now proves germany ’ s cycling hero has returned and that he is ready to go head-to-head with armstrong .

jan ullrich pulls out the pedal power and races to close the gap between the tour de france ’ s top leader lance armstrong after a victorious sprint on the tour ’ s 12th stage and a strong second place on saturday . " jan is back ! " screamed the headlines of germany ’ s newspapers on saturday .
after a spectacular win in the tour de france time trial on friday brought him to within half a minute of the tour ’ s overall leader , lance armstrong , and a strong second-place showing in the 13th stage narrowed the lead even further , germany ’ s best chance for winning this year ’ s race looks like he ’ s finally back on track .
jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 and since then has more often made headlines for his scandals than sporting feats , was jubilant after finishing the 12th stage of the tour 1 minute and 36 seconds ahead of the four-time tour winner armstrong .
" i am overjoyed , i never expected that .
i just wanted to have a good tour .
now i have a tour win .
i am close to tears , " ullrich was quoted in saturday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" anything is possible , " the triumphant ullrich said after his friday win .
even ullrich ’ s manager wolfgang strohband was surprised with the performance of the bianchi team captain .
" the tour is now wide open again .
i could not believe that he -lsb- ullrich -rsb- could beat armstrong so convincingly , " he told the frankfurt-based newspaper .
closing in on yellow and after coming in second to carlos sastre on the 13th stage on saturday , ullrich ’ s race for victory picked up speed and stamina .
he is now seated in the overall second spot , just 15 seconds away from the coveted yellow jersey currently worn by armstrong .
his chances of holding on to the number two position or even advancing in the next few days look the best they have in a long time .
" i ’ m happy jan wasn ’ t afraid -lsb- on saturday -rsb- and didn ’ t hold back on the attack , " bianchi team coach rudy pevenage said to reporters .
heading into the next three days in the pyrenees , armstrong will have to keep a close eye on ullrich , who has finished the tour second on four occasions .
in the words of die welt , " the showdown is coming in the pyrenees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has returned to the tour de france a winner .
jan ’ s comeback a year ago ullrich didn ’ t look like he could muster up the strength to challenge armstrong .
his career had hit rock bottom after a doping ban for ecstasy and a reoccurring knee injury sidelined him for months and forced him out of last year ’ s tour competition .
he then began racking up strikes against his name for wild partying and traffic violations .
he put on weight and lost several races .
then , after leaving team telekom , ullrich struggled to find his footing with a new team , coast , which disbanded after only a few races due to its inability to pay its cyclists .
" he was a crashed hero a year ago , " wrote bild newspaper columnist matthias brügelmann on saturday .
" he had disappeared , was a nobody .
he could have retired altogether , relaxed with the millions he had made . "
but ullrich was already working on his comeback .
in may , he switched to the mint-green jersey of the italian bicycle manufacture bianchi and has worked hard to get himself back in shape .
in june he put in a good fifth place showing at the deutschland tour , but fell far short of what the rostock-born cyclist knew he was capable of doing .
friday ’ s victory in the 47-kilometer time trial at cap decouverte and his rapid closing in on armstrong on saturday now proves germany ’ s cycling hero has returned and that he is ready to go head-to-head with armstrong .
" it ’ s going to be a sensational battle to the finish between the two giants of the sport , " die welt newspaper prophesized on saturday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tour de france turns 100 in its 100 years of history , the tour de france has had some high moments and low moments .

two months before bavarian state elections , the christian social union gave edmund stoiber a resounding show of support at a party congress and applauded his criticism of government tax policy . at a two-day party congress in nuremberg this weekend , the bavarian-based opposition christian social union came out strong behind current state premier edmund stoiber .
with a record vote of 96.97 percent , the party members reinstated the csu chairman in office and gave him a resounding applause for his criticism of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s plans for a tax reform .
in a half-hour speech outlining the party ’ s future goals for more involvement on the national level , stoiber attacked what he called the social democrat ’ s " unacceptable " proposals for bringing forward to 2004 a tax cut which was originally planned for 2005 .
stoiber said schröder ’ s plans to finance the tax cut by borrowing five billion euros on credit " only demonstrates the utter incompetence of the government when it comes to finance and tax policies . "
he added , that although the csu and its larger sister party , the christian democratic union , generally supported a tax cut as a means for jump-starting the lagging economy – in fact they had called for such a reform in their last election campaign – it needed to have a solid financial backing otherwise it would end up hurting not helping the country .
stoiber criticized the chancellor for not being up front and honest with the german people and said the federal government should look towards bavaria as a model of good governance .
no blockade politics stoiber ’ s criticism of the current tax reform proposal , however , was coupled with a clear warning to members in the conservative bloc , namely hessen ’ s state premier roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , not to stand in the way of tax cuts for the simple sake of blocking government reform plans .
" cdu and csu have been and will continue to be a party in favor of lowering taxes , " the csu chairman and last year ’ s opposition chancellor candidate announced in a tacit gibe to koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has repeatedly stated his objections to cutting taxes as a means of boosting the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's state premier roland koch of the cdu .
earlier in the week the premier of hessen was quoted in the bild newspaper as saying he would block chancellor schröder and finance minister hans eichel ’ s plans for pushing forward a tax break at the expense of mounting debt .
" before we stoop to such financial trickery , as schröder and eichel are devising , let ’ s be honest to the country ’ s citizens and say rather no tax break than one bought on tick , " koch said .
koch ’ s comments were brushed aside by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the cdu , who attended the csu congress as guest speaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairwoman of cdu angela merkel stands next to edmund stoiber of csu .
" we are two different parties , " she said , " and it would be surprising if we didn ’ t occasionally have different nuances , different views and different experiences .
but my dear friends , what counts is the fact that for all difficult political questions the cdu and the csu have always found a joint solution . "
stoiber echoed his conservative colleague and emphasized the importance of towing one political line on the issue of tax reform .
" we can only achieve our goals when we speak with one voice . "

german foreign minister joschka fischer took warm stock of his four-day visit to the u.s. and offered humanitarian aid but no troops to iraq . an upbeat german foreign minister joschka fischer met the press gathered in front of the white house on thursday , after talks with u.s. vice president dick cheney – his last stop on his four-day visit to the u.s. fischer praised the sunny weather and the german-american relationship , said he had good and open discussions with cheney and added he was generally pleased with the " receptive audience " he had come across in washington .
concrete " european-american " cooperation fischer said in a german television interview discussions in recent days with u.s. secretary of state colin powell , national security advisor condoleezza rice as well with vice president cheney had ranged from regional crises right from afghanistan to iran the middle east and the importance of doing all they could in keeping the peace in the regions .
" overall we europeans can make important contributions here , even in the middle east conflict , " fischer told the ard television channel .
earlier in the week fischer , on his first trip to the u.s. since november last year , had underlined the significance of transatlantic cooperation in crisis regions including iraq .
" to secure peace is of common interest to europe , my country and the u.s. , " he said .
humanitarian aid , but no troops to iraq , as yet however fischer ’ s stance remained unchanged on the central question of whether germany would provide military help to stabilize postwar iraq .
" we didn ’ t speak about a possible military contribution .
there were neither any concrete demands from the american side , nor readiness on our part to change our position , " he said .
speculation has been mounting in germany in recent days of whether it will provide troops to iraq after a u.s. senate decision last week to ask nato for military reinforcements .
continuing resistance from iraqi groups , mounting american and british casualties and rising costs of maintaining a huge peacekeeping operation in iraq has forced the u.s. to seek broader international support .
however fischer consistently emphasized during his four-day u.s. tour that the german army , presently on foreign mission in three different continents , was too overstretched to handle a further foreign deployment .
he also made clear the german government could not even consider such a u.s. request unless there was a specific united nations mandate to legitimize their presence in iraq .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer told reporters on wednesday .
" we are not part of the coalition . "
fischer at the same time emphasized the u.s. had not yet officially asked nato for support in iraq .
but the foreign minister did offer humanitarian help .
" we have expressed our readiness to provide humanitarian help and even earmarked the relevant funds , " fischer told the ard . " i also told the americans that the german industry is ready to provide its contribution for the financial reconstruction of iraq if so desired , " fischer said .
" however as long as there is no concrete wish list , it ’ s very difficult for us to say anything for sure , " he added .
" ice-breaking diplomacy " fischer overall took positive stock of his trip saying it was " very successful " and the atmosphere " excellent . "
" there ’ s more openness , i ’ m taking that impression home with me , " he said .
however he was evasive about whether there was a possibility of german chancellor schröder travelling to the u.s. anytime soon .
" our relationship is based on a strong fundament and it can withstand differences of opinion .
however the question of a possible chancellor visit didn ’ t play any role , " he said .
relations between u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have been strained ever since the german leader vehemently opposed the u.s.-led war against iraq and the two haven ’ t had a personal meeting since last summer when the u.s. president visited germany .
however one of the strongest symbols that fischer ’ s trip had made a definite contribution towards thawing the soured transatlantic relationship came during a lighter moment with powell on wednesday .
the secretary of state surprised his german counterpart by producing an empty case of beer during a formal state department lunch .
" i have this beautiful gift for you , " powell announced to peals of laughter .
the lager had been gifted to powell on his last visit to berlin in may because he had once mentioned he missed the old-fashioned , re-saleable bottles , which could be put back in the fridge for later and cooler consumption .

jan ullrich pulls out the pedal power and races to close the gap between the tour de france ’ s top leader lance armstrong after a victorious sprint on the tour ’ s 12th stage and a strong second place on saturday . " jan is back ! " screamed the headlines of germany ’ s newspapers on saturday .
after a spectacular win in the tour de france time trial on friday brought him to within half a minute of the tour ’ s overall leader , lance armstrong , and a strong second-place showing in the 13th stage narrowed the lead even further , germany ’ s best chance for winning this year ’ s race looks like he ’ s finally back on track .
jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1997 and since then has more often made headlines for his scandals than sporting feats , was jubilant after finishing the 12th stage of the tour 1 minute and 36 seconds ahead of the four-time tour winner armstrong .
" i am overjoyed , i never expected that .
i just wanted to have a good tour .
now i have a tour win .
i am close to tears , " ullrich was quoted in saturday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" anything is possible , " the triumphant ullrich said after his friday win .
even ullrich ’ s manager wolfgang strohband was surprised with the performance of the bianchi team captain .
" the tour is now wide open again .
i could not believe that he -lsb- ullrich -rsb- could beat armstrong so convincingly , " he told the frankfurt-based newspaper .
closing in on yellow and after coming in second to carlos sastre on the 13th stage on saturday , ullrich ’ s race for victory picked up speed and stamina .
he is now seated in the overall second spot , just 15 seconds away from the coveted yellow jersey currently worn by armstrong .
his chances of holding on to the number two position or even advancing in the next few days look the best they have in a long time .
" i ’ m happy jan wasn ’ t afraid -lsb- on saturday -rsb- and didn ’ t hold back on the attack , " bianchi team coach rudy pevenage said to reporters .
heading into the next three days in the pyrenees , armstrong will have to keep a close eye on ullrich , who has finished the tour second on four occasions .
in the words of die welt , " the showdown is coming in the pyrenees . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has returned to the tour de france a winner .
jan ’ s comeback a year ago ullrich didn ’ t look like he could muster up the strength to challenge armstrong .
his career had hit rock bottom after a doping ban for ecstasy and a reoccurring knee injury sidelined him for months and forced him out of last year ’ s tour competition .
he then began racking up strikes against his name for wild partying and traffic violations .
he put on weight and lost several races .
then , after leaving team telekom , ullrich struggled to find his footing with a new team , coast , which disbanded after only a few races due to its inability to pay its cyclists .
" he was a crashed hero a year ago , " wrote bild newspaper columnist matthias brügelmann on saturday .
" he had disappeared , was a nobody .
he could have retired altogether , relaxed with the millions he had made . "
but ullrich was already working on his comeback .
in may , he switched to the mint-green jersey of the italian bicycle manufacture bianchi and has worked hard to get himself back in shape .
in june he put in a good fifth place showing at the deutschland tour , but fell far short of what the rostock-born cyclist knew he was capable of doing .
friday ’ s victory in the 47-kilometer time trial at cap decouverte and his rapid closing in on armstrong on saturday now proves germany ’ s cycling hero has returned and that he is ready to go head-to-head with armstrong .

"
the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .
like the 39-year-old guth , marc albrecht , who will conduct " the flying dutchman , " is under 40 and new to bayreuth .

wolfgang wagner and his troop of new faces are n't afraid of creating a stir like patrice chéreau did on the 100th anniversary of the festival with his legendary interpretation of " the ring of the nibelungen . "
chéreau 's götterdämmerung was followed by more than thirty minutes of emphatic ' bravos ' and enraged insults , but in the end the frenchman 's production breathed new life into bayreuth , changing the festival from a yearly homage to wagner to a theater workshop .
no iconoclasts here " schlingensief , marthaler and von trier are n't iconoclasts who will destroy wagner 's temple , " festival spokesman peter emmerich recently placated potential critics .
" the point is to find contemporary interpretations that justify the singularity and necessity for bayreuth in the future . "

over time he gained a reputation for being a provocateur himself .

when it comes to wagner , he said he 's mainly interested in the composer 's political thought and his focus on bringing the divine down to earth .

"
the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .
german hacks are wondering whether it 's the beginning of a new era . claus guth 's new production of " the flying dutchman " will open the bayreuth festival , the yearly series of performances that has showcased richard wagner 's operas since 1876 , on july 25 .
for decades , festival head wolfgang wagner has dominated bayreuth with his own productions of his grandfathers ' works .
but last year the 83-year-old announced he would no longer work as a director .
now bayreuth is opening up to a younger generation .
wagner , who has led the festival for more than 50 years , seems to have lost interest in staging traditional productions .
like the 39-year-old guth , marc albrecht , who will conduct " the flying dutchman , " is under 40 and new to bayreuth .
wagner engaged the two men to put on a production at the renowned festival after the two were acclaimed for their world premiere of peter ruzicka 's opera " celan " in dresden in 2001 .

the bbc 's talent show is moving to saturday night for its second series , which begins next weekend .
fame academy grew into a ratings success but it is parked firmly in the time slot used by pop idol in 2001 - and the itv1 show is due to return two weeks after .
the potential clash comes amid record low saturday night audiences for itv - and the bbc 's admission that it is struggling to find a winning format for its teatime slot .
itv1 is still feeling the loss of blind date , while the bbc would love to find this decade 's answer to noel 's house party or the generation game .
saturday early evening tv : 19 july , 2003 bbc one : the vicar of dibley , the weakest link itv1 : film : the lost world : jurassic park instead , bbc one is soldiering on with repeats of the vicar of dibley and one-off specials of weakest link - while itv 's offering this saturday is a jurassic park film from 1997 .
pop idol has been one of itv1 's biggest-ever shows , averaging 7.6 million viewers and pulling in more than 13 million for its final .
saturday early evening tv 15 years ago : 16 july , 1988 bbc one : news , world rock ' n ' roll trophy -lrb- dance event presented by joe brown -rrb- itv : film : the incredible hulk the popstars spin-off , featuring legendarily rude putdowns of contestants from judge simon cowell , breathed new life into saturday night tv .
when the bbc responded with its own take on the idea , fame academy , more than five million regularly tuned in - on friday nights .
saturday early evening tv 20 years ago : 23 july , 1983 bbc one : blake 's seven -lrb- sci-fi series -rrb- , film : the pink panther itv : happy days -lrb- us comedy series -rrb- , the fall guy -lrb- us drama series -rrb- , just amazing -lrb- stunt show -rrb- itv executives may feel they have good reason to be miffed at the bbc 's scheduling : last saturday 's itv1 ratings slumped to their lowest ever , with no more than 3.9 million viewers tuning in during prime time .
itv has been home to some of the biggest-hitting saturday shows of the last few years , among them who wants to be a millionaire ? , stars in their eyes and saturday night takeaway starring ant and dec .
saturday early evening tv 30 years ago : 21 july , 1973 bbc one : news , the amazing chinese acrobats -lrb- circus act -rrb- , dad 's army itv : the julie andrews show , the protectors -lrb- action series -rrb- , the rolf harris show however , itv 's spokeswoman was bullish about its prospects , telling bbc news online : " itv has had all of the highest-rated programmes this year , and the ratings for pop idol and fame academy are miles apart .
" our only concern is that as public service broadcasters , it 's common sense not to have similar formats in the same slot - in the interest of the viewers . "
she put the network 's recent viewing slump down to the good weather and people going on holiday .
pop idol became the format to beat generally , she said , ratings were falling as viewers chose from a plethora of digital channels and alternative leisure pursuits .
meanwhile , bbc director general greg dyke conceded this week that his programme makers faced " a challenge " in finding the right teatime programme for saturdays .
last weekend , the weakest link - which went out at 1800 - had 3.2 million viewers , while prank show just for laughs one hour later fared little better with 3.9 million .
have your say oh bring back the days of basil brush , followed by dr who and jim 'll fix it bob watson , spain send us your comments bbc one 's spokeswoman said : " we have n't been doing brilliantly .
it 's something we 've been upfront about .
" we have n't found a breakthrough format .
it does n't have to be a light entertainment show from a studio , followed by another light entertainment show from a studio . "
the bbc says it has switched fame academy in order to best reach its target audience of 16-34-year-olds .
it insists there is " room for both " programmes .
whether it will turn into the kind of success that answers its saturday night prayers , however , remains to be seen .

masekela himself is a recovering addict , having gone into rehabilitation six years ago before establishing an organisation to help those with similar problems in his homeland .
and he told bbc world service 's the ticket programme that he felt a duty to help others suffering from the same problems .
" i come from a community that was the source of the music that i try to make .

masekela made his name in america in the 1960s , and since then has released 30 albums and toured the world .
but he said that for most of that time he had little confidence with the trumpet without using some sort of drug .
" for 44 years , i felt that i could n't play better unless i 'd had at least a spliff , " he acknowledged .
" i was always a good musician - it 's how it affects your life and how it affects how you affect people when you 're high . "
now he was clean , he said , he wanted music to be his only addiction .
" when you 're an addict , what you drink or what you take is not the problem , " masekela said .

the former boomtown rats frontman and live aid organiser headlined the opening night of the three-day event on friday .
meic stevens , geraint jarman , irish band the sawdoctors and rock harpist alan stivell will all have taken the stage at the open-air festival over the weekend .
sesiwn fawr , which means big session , offers a range of music from around the world on five stages .
a craft market and a children 's festival also form part of the festival .
last year marked a change in the festival 's history when fans had to pay to see bands for the first time .
a weekend ticket for adults cost £ 40 and a day ticket , £ 15 .
the main stage was also moved from the town square to an enclosure on a piece of public land known as the marian on the outskirts of the town .
having been held in the heart of the town for more than 10 years , organisers said growing crowd numbers meant the festival had outgrown the small square .
but festival-goer guto roberts from felinheli said this had not diminished the event 's appeal .
" it 's a great opportunity for the young people of wales to get together to enjoy , " he said .
" you do n't get a chance to see good live music like this very often .
" there is a good crowd here and everyone is enjoying themselves .
" i have already seen the one person i was loking forward to on saturday - meic stevens .
he was amazing . "
mr roberts said he also enjoyed bob geldof 's performance on friday evening , despite a comment he made at the beginning of his set .
" it was fantastic , although one little comment upset the crowd a bit .
" he said he had learnt a bit of welsh , then just made up gobbledygook .

children have been receiving grab five ! bags , containing fruit and vegetables in a pilot scheme in plymouth , run by the food and farming campaigners sustain .
alongside the five pieces of fruit is a snack , made by sponsors , food firm ambrosia , which contains sugar and colourings .
sustain , the body which started the grab five scheme , believes this sends out a mixed message to children .
sarah walker-smith of the plymouth public health development unit has been liaising with sustain on the project .
ambrosia was brought in because the scheme was short of cash she said : " all the evidence is that children need one message , and it needs to be consistent .
" if you give them a choice they will take the sweet product and we want them to eat the fruit and veg . "
in plymouth , business in the community has been running the scheme on behalf of sustain .
supermarkets have been donating fruit and veg , but a shortage of cash led to ambrosia being brought in to help fund it .
business in the community gave ambrosia permission to add its own snack , but sustain was so concerned it is scrapping the pilot project .
alan terrell of business in the community said : " we had to fund this campaign .
it 's slightly disappointing it was n't picked up by other organisations .
" i 'm afraid it is a mixed message , but it is not something we are too worried about . "
ambrosia said it was invited to support a highly successful education programme in primary schools .
business in the community said it was planning to continue the scheme , with or without out the support of sustain .

the milestone is being heralded as a success for a project which set out to re-establish one of scotland 's rarest birds .
scottish natural heritage and rspb scotland have been working together since 1989 to reintroduce red kites in three areas .
the spectacular birds of prey , with their distinctive forked tails , were hunted to extinction in scotland in 1870 .
this year the chicks have fledged from 35 breeding pairs in north scotland , 18 in central scotland and four in dumfries and galloway .
rspb scotland 's duncan orr-ewing said : " the breeding success of the reintroduced birds suggest that this species could soon be a familiar sight to many communities across scotland . "
bird poisoning however , comparisons with a scheme in england has shown that persecution remains a problem north of the border .
although breeding rates among red kites released in the chilterns are similar to scotland , the population is higher in the south .
rspb scotland research has shown that more than a third of the birds in the north of scotland were poisoned between 1989 and 2001 .
