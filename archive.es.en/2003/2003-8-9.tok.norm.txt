some papers consider the move to be revolutionary , but most fear that it could split the worldwide anglican community .
difficult days for the anglican church .
norway 's aftenposten the election of gene robinson is expected to fuel the debate in us society , which is split over the issue of homosexuality and partnerships between people of the same gender .
sweden 's expressen gene robinson has become the first openly-homosexual bishop in history ...
the issue of legalizing same-sex marriages is one of the most pressing in america today ...
the topic is of just as much interest to society as the problems of a post-war settlement in iraq , curbing the nuclear ambitions of north korea or reviving the us economy .
russia 's izvestiya us episcopalian church threatens to split .
germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung declared homosexual elected bishop in the united states ...
split of church family imminent .
austria 's wiener zeitung prejudice against people with a different sexual orientation than the usual one is at home wherever there are enough fools incapable of differentiating between what is usual and what is normal - and , unfortunately , there are enough of them not only in every church but in every society .
this is why rev robinson 's elevation to the post of bishop is an act revolutionary in the true sense of the word ...

czech republic 's pravo the anglican church , which affiliates almost 80 million worshippers from all continents , is experiencing an earthquake ...
the debate on the rights of minorities in the united states , especially of homosexuals , has been given a further stimulus .
in us society , in which more than 80 per cent of people are members of multifarious churches , the rights of homosexuals are deeply divisive and are an explosive political issue .
czech republic 's mlada fronta dnes the confirmation of the appointment of this controversial bishop is an historic decision ... the us episcopalian church is now facing the danger of schism given resistance to gene robinson 's appointment among the so-called new anglicans , who are known for their radical conservatism ...

slovakia 's hospodarske noviny gay bishop tears the anglican church ...
gene robinson 's election has provoked an earthquake in the anglican world .
france 's liberation the gay bishop has caused a scandal in the anglican church ...

france 's le monde the decision to choose a gay bishop has caused loud protests in the us and worldwide .. because of rev robinson 's election , the anglican church is going through particularly difficult times .
poland 's gazeta wyborcza anglicans in kenya threatened to sever links with a us diocese that elected a practising homosexual as its bishop .
church leaders condemned the americans ' decision , saying homosexuality was unacceptable .
kenya 's the nation the anglican church in southern africa -lrb- cpsa -rrb- is standing by its stance regarding the election of gay bishops , reinforcing the claim that any person who is ordained a priest in the church is eligible for election as a bishop ...
the head of the cpsa said sexual orientation was irrelevant , though the cpsa did require that homosexual clergy live celibate lives .
south africa 's cape argus a total of 62 diocesan bishops decided it , out of 107 .

a detailed investigation found only one case of the disease .
but the ban by the united states and many other countries has remained in place , crippling the country 's important beef industry .
the american move is only a partial lifting of the ban but it is being warmly welcomed in canada .
huge losses just a single canadian cow was found with bse , but the effect on the country 's beef industry has been profound .
more than 30 countries slammed their doors shut to canadian beef in may , a move that the industry says has cost it $ 750 million already .
i can not stress strongly enough that the continued protection of the us food supply is our top priority .
the risk to public health is extremely low ann veneman , us agriculture secretary now , however , us agriculture secretary ann veneman says she believes canadian beef is safe and will again allow some of it into the country .
but she has left heavy restrictions in place and that amounts to less than half the trade that it used to be .
nonetheless , for canadians , it is very welcome news .
the president of the canadian beef export federation , ben thorkalson , says it is a good start and hopes the american example will be followed elsewhere around the globe .
in recent days , politicians and ranchers have been warning of the complete collapse of canada 's beef industry within just a few weeks .
now they say the american move means the industry , while badly shaken , will probably survive .

the bbc 's health correspondent adam brimelow looks at the implications .
should the childless be celebrating yet ?
well , the guidelines from the national institute for clinical excellence are still being considered and they are at a pretty early stage , it has to be said .
among the people who are going to get a look at these recommendations are the department of health and of course they are likely to be mindful of the financial implications of such a huge expansion of infertility services .
having said that , it was the doh which commissioned this report in the first place so they will have to take nice 's recommendations very seriously .
will any decision be a long time coming ?
yes , the final recommendations are n't due out until early next year .
there are two phases of consultations - with so many interested groups and such a politically and ethically sensitive issue , there has to be quite wide ranging consultation .
at the moment nice is going through the first period of consultation , asking the interested groups : " how are we doing ?
are our recommendations going along the right lines ? "
they are going to get feedback from the groups and draw up secondary recommendations , which may or may not include these guidelines on ivf .
and then finally they will publish their report early next year .
who would qualify for this treatment ?
it appears that it is going to apply to women under the age of 40 and also it appears that six cycles of ivf treatment would be on offer .
but certainly it is going to be very difficult to draw an arbitrary cut-off line in somebody 's life .
there are bound to be winners and losers in any such decision making process and those who lose out are going to be bitterly disappointed .
if vast amounts of money are diverted to ivf would services such as cancer care suffer ?
obviously , there is a finite amount of money that is being allocated to nhs spending but this whole issue of cost is very difficult to evaluate .
certainly people involved in the fertility industry point out that the cost to the economy of infertility are enormous in terms of stress , depression , work days lost and basically if you invested more money in providing better more reliable fertility treatment on the nhs there would be a net saving .

gwyndaf williams , the pilot of the twin-engine piper seneca chartered in an effort to locate and rescue the stricken mammal took to the air on saturday and flew for three hours over 200 sq miles .
but none of the crew saw anything , and now the search has been called off .
the crew have had numerous setbacks throughout the week because of fog caused by the hot weather .
visibility was seriously hampered on several occasions when the crew hoped to try and spot the small whale , which was thought to be about five miles off the coast between cardigan bay and aberaeron .
but on saturday , flying conditions were described as " excellent " , with perfect viewing conditions .
dophins like this can suffer horrific injuries flying at 500m above the see , the crew members were able to make out porpoises in the water and even small pieces of rubbish like plastic bags , but the whale was nowhere to be seen .
" if it had been on the surface in the area we searched we would have seen it easily , " mr williams said .
attempts to reach the whale and take it to safety began more than a week ago , but there has not been a confirmed sighting since tuesday .
marine experts feared the whale animal was facing a slow death from starvation and exhaustion .
it is thought the whale may have swallowed part of the net in which it is caught .
thousands of whales , dolphins , and porpoises are washed up on beaches every year in similar conditions .
severe injuries environmentalists , led by the wildlife trusts , have been campaigning for changes in commercial fishing practices to prevent such tragedies , known as by-catch deaths .
the animals often follow shoals of fish caught by trawlers and get tangled in the vast nets .
their injuries are often so severe that they bleed to death .
eye-witnesses have said the cardigan bay whale appears to be very thin and may have been unable to feed .
mark simmonds , science director of the whale and dolphin conservation society , said : " it can often be difficult to find an individual animal from a boat .
" only a small proportion of the body can be seen from such a low platform and as there is such a vast area of sea to cover . "
adult minke whales are usually between seven and 10m long and can weigh up to 10 tonnes when fully grown .
these are just one of over 20 different species of whales , dolphins and porpoises - known collectively as cetaceans - which are found in uk waters .

the foundation stones of st guthlac 's priory , which dates back to the 12th century , were recently discovered underneath land at hereford county hospital .
about 20 skeletons , believed to be of mediaeval monks , were also uncovered .
but archaeologists must complete their research at the site before a new access road through the hospital is built next week .
quality fragments civil engineer nigel jones told the bbc 's midlands today programme how the remains of the former monastery were uncovered .
" at first we thought it might have been a boundary wall but they got in their with their trowels and , after a bit of scratching , they found out it was a stone grave . "
kath crooks , an archaeologist working on the project , said : " it has been very exciting .
finding it after all this time is really quite good .
" and we 're pretty sure that it must be a fairly high status building because of the high quality of the architectural fragments that we found . "
seven of the skeletons that would have been destroyed by the construction of a new drain will be removed from the site .
the remains will be examined and then reburied in consecrated ground .
st guthlac 's priory was abandoned in the 16th century during the dissolution of the monasteries .

with-profits investments are the driving force behind our pensions , endowment mortgages and savings plans . listen to the programme but how many of us actually understand how they work , and if we did would we still want them ?
with-profits policies are linked to the performance of shares .
they are supposed to be managed in such a way that they smooth out the highs and lows of the stock market while relying on annual and final bonuses for their growth .
but after three years of falling markets , the life insurers who sell these policies have slashed bonuses , and in some cases , failed to pay any at all .
it feels like we have ordered a fridge and been given a coolbox alison clarke this has left customers fuming .
fifteen years ago , listener alison clarke decided to take out a " with profits " endowment with scottish widows .
she wanted to save for her children 's future and was hoping her policy would pay out around £ 34,000 when it matures in five years time .
but that is now looking highly unlikely .
in fact , alison could end up with only half this amount .
she decided to join inside money to find out more about how these investments work , and whether she should stick with her policy .
she told the programme : " we have paid into this policy through good times and bad .
" there has never been any suggestion that things were doing dismally , and yet it feels like we have ordered a fridge and been given a coolbox . "
the bottom line for alison is : with five years until her policy matures , and £ 3000 worth of premiums still to pay , should she continue ?
