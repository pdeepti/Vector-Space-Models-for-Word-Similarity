the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic and labor minister wolfgang clement .
" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .
clement against fee for now clement said that companies would be responsible for financing their own training programs and that the investment of taxes in the creation of places would for the time being not come into consideration .
the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee electronics engineer .
" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .
dieter philipp , president of german skilled trades association , told the berliner zeitung the legal compulsory measures , such as an apprenticeship fee or levy , would only damage the system ’ s infrastructure by putting unnecessary strain on it .
philipp said clement 's plan to virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , which will allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification , was partly to blame for firms ' reluctance to take on new trainees . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government pushes to reform skilled crafts despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .

the 26-year-old ethnic palestinian was among nine people detained across germany in april 2002 on suspicion of plotting terrorist attacks .
the al-tawhid cell , part of a group with alleged links to al qaeda , " developed a plan to attack people in a busy square of a german city using a pistol with a silencer , and to detonate a hand grenade in another german city in the immediate vicinity of an israeli or jewish installation with the goal of killing as many people as possible , " german prosecutors said last month .
the prosecutors office has not identified the cities or locations the group allegedly wanted to target .
if found guilty of the charges of belonging to a terrorist organization and plotting terrorist acts , abdallah could face up to 10 years in prison .
the prosecutors say that the suspect has made an " extensive confession . "
four other suspected members of the cell also remain in custody .
task to identify targets , get weapons " it was -lrb- abdallah 's -rrb- task to identify potential targets in germany and above all to procure the necessary weapons , " prosecutor dirk fernholz said in the opening statement of the trial on tuesday .

authorities involved in the case said that after their meeting , al-zarqawi told abdallah to return to germany to help the leader of the cell , identified only as mohamed abu d , who is also being held in custody .
the al-tawhid leader allegedly asked abdallah to procure blank french , spanish and portuguese passports as well as a forged moroccan passport for al-zarqawi himself .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .
" my main work was to dedicate myself to forgotten , politically persecuted artists , " she said .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .

named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .

" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .

the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .
" my main work was to dedicate myself to forgotten , politically persecuted artists , " she said .
" it had possibly to do with the fact , that i was myself a child of persecution .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic and labor minister wolfgang clement .
" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .
clement against fee for now clement said that companies would be responsible for financing their own training programs and that the investment of taxes in the creation of places would for the time being not come into consideration .
the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .

" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .
dieter philipp , president of german skilled trades association , told the berliner zeitung the legal compulsory measures , such as an apprenticeship fee or levy , would only damage the system ’ s infrastructure by putting unnecessary strain on it .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic and labor minister wolfgang clement .
" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .
clement against fee for now clement said that companies would be responsible for financing their own training programs and that the investment of taxes in the creation of places would for the time being not come into consideration .
the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee electronics engineer .
" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .
dieter philipp , president of german skilled trades association , told the berliner zeitung the legal compulsory measures , such as an apprenticeship fee or levy , would only damage the system ’ s infrastructure by putting unnecessary strain on it .
philipp said clement 's plan to virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , which will allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification , was partly to blame for firms ' reluctance to take on new trainees . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government pushes to reform skilled crafts despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .
" my main work was to dedicate myself to forgotten , politically persecuted artists , " she said .
" it had possibly to do with the fact , that i was myself a child of persecution .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .
speaking at a united nations refugee commission event in berlin on monday , german interior minister , otto schilly said the comments were " in no way acceptable , " and called on the italian reform minister to formally review his statements . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejects legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigration dominates eu summit european union leaders reach agreement to combat illegal immigration and immigrant smuggling by operating joint border patrols .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .
" my main work was to dedicate myself to forgotten , politically persecuted artists , " she said .

as germany 's largest foreign development aid agency , the deutsche entwicklungsdienst -lrb- ded -rrb- celebrates four decades of existence on tuesday , berlin has promised to keep the funds flowing so it can keep up the good work . founded on june 24 , 1963 , the deutsche entwicklungsdienst -lrb- ded -rrb- was modeled on the american peace corps , itself born out of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's idea to create a voluntary service for young people to help abroad . on tuesday , the ded observed its 40th anniversary in the presence of german president johannes rau , the minister for development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and several foreign dignitaries in bonn .
it was a happy occasion for an organization that over the years has sent more than 13,000 development aid workers to more than fifty countries in africa , asia and latin america “ the ded has played a very important role in making globalization more just , ” said wieczorek-zeul in a speech to around 500 guests . though helping to improve the economic and social welfare of the developing world is certainly reason enough to celebrate , the ded can also be pleased wieczorek-zeul and german finance minister hans eichel on monday agreed not to skimp on development aid , despite budget cuts at most of the other federal ministries . with this year 's development budget of nearly € 85 million -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- , the ded currently has the means to keep more than 1,000 aid workers in 45 countries worldwide .
wieczorek-zeul said budget cuts at the development ministry ’ s expense could make it difficult for germany to uphold its international commitments .
germany last year pledged with other nations at the un summit in johannesburg last year to try and halve world poverty by the year 2015 . promoting peace the ded has come a long way from when kennedy attended the official ceremony founding the organization 40 years ago .
back then the ded sent around 100 specialists , including mechanics , farmers , engineers , nurses and doctors to libya , tanzania and chile . but the face of the agency has evolved over the years .
according to ded director jürgen wilhelm , it is no longer simply a case of sending skilled laborers overseas . " we have an increasing number of academic aid workers , either from commercial , administrative or social science backgrounds .
we also have lawyers working for our civil peace agency , who help to find missing persons in latin america , or who have administrative experience , " wilhelm told deutsche welle . these days some 75 percent of all ded volunteers are university graduates , not only from germany but from countries across the european union , and the average age has risen from 25 in 1973 around 40 these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the start of 2003 , the ded also dedicated its jubilee year to an initiative dubbed ' development for peace ' .
development minister wieczorek-zeul said the undertaking highlighted how the ded ’ s mission had extended beyond just battling poverty . " of course the fight against poverty is fundamental , as is allowing people to develop themselves .
but we have also , through the ded created the civil peace agency , which also requires its workers to actively stimulate peace , perhaps by means of mediation in a local conflict , or by the non-violent solution to a conflict , " she said . despite all the changes over the past four decades , the ethos behind the ded has remained the same .
at the core of the organization ’ s philosophy is still the aim to help people to help themselves . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate rages on german role in post-war iraq a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .

" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .

the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .

" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .
dieter philipp , president of german skilled trades association , told the berliner zeitung the legal compulsory measures , such as an apprenticeship fee or levy , would only damage the system ’ s infrastructure by putting unnecessary strain on it .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic and labor minister wolfgang clement .
" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .
clement against fee for now clement said that companies would be responsible for financing their own training programs and that the investment of taxes in the creation of places would for the time being not come into consideration .
the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .

" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .
speaking at a united nations refugee commission event in berlin on monday , german interior minister , otto schilly said the comments were " in no way acceptable , " and called on the italian reform minister to formally review his statements . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejects legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigration dominates eu summit european union leaders reach agreement to combat illegal immigration and immigrant smuggling by operating joint border patrols .
the eu has also set a timeline for establishing a joint asylum policy .
treading immigration 's fine line in europe britain , spain and italy are lobbying for tougher measures to stem illegal immigration into the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.06.2003 wave of immigrants laps at italy 's door großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants crowd a small boat which arrived on the island of lampedusa this month .
as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .
speaking at a united nations refugee commission event in berlin on monday , german interior minister , otto schilly said the comments were " in no way acceptable , " and called on the italian reform minister to formally review his statements . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejects legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigration dominates eu summit european union leaders reach agreement to combat illegal immigration and immigrant smuggling by operating joint border patrols .
the eu has also set a timeline for establishing a joint asylum policy .
treading immigration 's fine line in europe britain , spain and italy are lobbying for tougher measures to stem illegal immigration into the european union .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic and labor minister wolfgang clement .
" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .
clement against fee for now clement said that companies would be responsible for financing their own training programs and that the investment of taxes in the creation of places would for the time being not come into consideration .
the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee electronics engineer .
" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .
dieter philipp , president of german skilled trades association , told the berliner zeitung the legal compulsory measures , such as an apprenticeship fee or levy , would only damage the system ’ s infrastructure by putting unnecessary strain on it .
philipp said clement 's plan to virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , which will allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification , was partly to blame for firms ' reluctance to take on new trainees . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government pushes to reform skilled crafts despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .
speaking at a united nations refugee commission event in berlin on monday , german interior minister , otto schilly said the comments were " in no way acceptable , " and called on the italian reform minister to formally review his statements . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejects legislation that would have become its first immigration law .

treading immigration 's fine line in europe britain , spain and italy are lobbying for tougher measures to stem illegal immigration into the european union .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .
" my main work was to dedicate myself to forgotten , politically persecuted artists , " she said .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .
speaking at a united nations refugee commission event in berlin on monday , german interior minister , otto schilly said the comments were " in no way acceptable , " and called on the italian reform minister to formally review his statements . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejects legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigration dominates eu summit european union leaders reach agreement to combat illegal immigration and immigrant smuggling by operating joint border patrols .
the eu has also set a timeline for establishing a joint asylum policy .
treading immigration 's fine line in europe britain , spain and italy are lobbying for tougher measures to stem illegal immigration into the european union .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic and labor minister wolfgang clement .
" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .
clement against fee for now clement said that companies would be responsible for financing their own training programs and that the investment of taxes in the creation of places would for the time being not come into consideration .
the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee electronics engineer .
" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .
dieter philipp , president of german skilled trades association , told the berliner zeitung the legal compulsory measures , such as an apprenticeship fee or levy , would only damage the system ’ s infrastructure by putting unnecessary strain on it .
philipp said clement 's plan to virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , which will allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification , was partly to blame for firms ' reluctance to take on new trainees . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government pushes to reform skilled crafts despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic and labor minister wolfgang clement .
" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .
clement against fee for now clement said that companies would be responsible for financing their own training programs and that the investment of taxes in the creation of places would for the time being not come into consideration .
the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .

" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .
dieter philipp , president of german skilled trades association , told the berliner zeitung the legal compulsory measures , such as an apprenticeship fee or levy , would only damage the system ’ s infrastructure by putting unnecessary strain on it .
philipp said clement 's plan to virtually eliminate the time-honored tradition of the meisterbrief or master craftsman ’ s diploma , which will allow ambitious journeymen to set up shop without the prestigious qualification , was partly to blame for firms ' reluctance to take on new trainees . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government pushes to reform skilled crafts despite protest from craftsmen and women , germany ’ s government has approved measures to abolish the master craftsman 's diploma in a number of vocations .
craftsmen fear the end of the centuries-old tradition .

as germany 's largest foreign development aid agency , the deutsche entwicklungsdienst -lrb- ded -rrb- celebrates four decades of existence on tuesday , berlin has promised to keep the funds flowing so it can keep up the good work . founded on june 24 , 1963 , the deutsche entwicklungsdienst -lrb- ded -rrb- was modeled on the american peace corps , itself born out of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's idea to create a voluntary service for young people to help abroad . on tuesday , the ded observed its 40th anniversary in the presence of german president johannes rau , the minister for development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and several foreign dignitaries in bonn .
it was a happy occasion for an organization that over the years has sent more than 13,000 development aid workers to more than fifty countries in africa , asia and latin america “ the ded has played a very important role in making globalization more just , ” said wieczorek-zeul in a speech to around 500 guests . though helping to improve the economic and social welfare of the developing world is certainly reason enough to celebrate , the ded can also be pleased wieczorek-zeul and german finance minister hans eichel on monday agreed not to skimp on development aid , despite budget cuts at most of the other federal ministries . with this year 's development budget of nearly € 85 million -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- , the ded currently has the means to keep more than 1,000 aid workers in 45 countries worldwide .

back then the ded sent around 100 specialists , including mechanics , farmers , engineers , nurses and doctors to libya , tanzania and chile . but the face of the agency has evolved over the years .
according to ded director jürgen wilhelm , it is no longer simply a case of sending skilled laborers overseas . " we have an increasing number of academic aid workers , either from commercial , administrative or social science backgrounds .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic and labor minister wolfgang clement .
" we have to mobilize everything that we back to create more apprenticeships , " clement told zdf television .
" whether or not it will work , i ca n't say . "
germany ’ s trade unions have said they expect schröder to implement the compulsory fee if firms fail to provide enough traineeships .
joachim koch-bantz , the head of division for training and qualification at the german federation of trade unions , told the berliner zeitung newspaper it was an " untenable situation " that two-thirds of germany companies do not train their own staff .
clement against fee for now clement said that companies would be responsible for financing their own training programs and that the investment of taxes in the creation of places would for the time being not come into consideration .
the government would continue in financing education but would not extend its support to skilled trades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee electronics engineer .
" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .
many dissenting voices believe that the government is wrong to force them to create positions for young apprentices when the state of the economy is such that many can not even hold onto their trained staff .
dieter philipp , president of german skilled trades association , told the berliner zeitung the legal compulsory measures , such as an apprenticeship fee or levy , would only damage the system ’ s infrastructure by putting unnecessary strain on it .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .
but suggestions to fine firms that fail to offer more has sparked sharp criticism . young men travelling the german countryside dressed in the traditional clothes of the " zimmermann " , or carpenter 's apprentice , as their predecessors have for centuries , used to be a common sight in germany .
their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .
speaking at a united nations refugee commission event in berlin on monday , german interior minister , otto schilly said the comments were " in no way acceptable , " and called on the italian reform minister to formally review his statements . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejects legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigration dominates eu summit european union leaders reach agreement to combat illegal immigration and immigrant smuggling by operating joint border patrols .
the eu has also set a timeline for establishing a joint asylum policy .
treading immigration 's fine line in europe britain , spain and italy are lobbying for tougher measures to stem illegal immigration into the european union .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .
" my main work was to dedicate myself to forgotten , politically persecuted artists , " she said .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .

as germany 's largest foreign development aid agency , the deutsche entwicklungsdienst -lrb- ded -rrb- celebrates four decades of existence on tuesday , berlin has promised to keep the funds flowing so it can keep up the good work . founded on june 24 , 1963 , the deutsche entwicklungsdienst -lrb- ded -rrb- was modeled on the american peace corps , itself born out of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's idea to create a voluntary service for young people to help abroad . on tuesday , the ded observed its 40th anniversary in the presence of german president johannes rau , the minister for development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and several foreign dignitaries in bonn .
it was a happy occasion for an organization that over the years has sent more than 13,000 development aid workers to more than fifty countries in africa , asia and latin america “ the ded has played a very important role in making globalization more just , ” said wieczorek-zeul in a speech to around 500 guests . though helping to improve the economic and social welfare of the developing world is certainly reason enough to celebrate , the ded can also be pleased wieczorek-zeul and german finance minister hans eichel on monday agreed not to skimp on development aid , despite budget cuts at most of the other federal ministries . with this year 's development budget of nearly € 85 million -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- , the ded currently has the means to keep more than 1,000 aid workers in 45 countries worldwide .
wieczorek-zeul said budget cuts at the development ministry ’ s expense could make it difficult for germany to uphold its international commitments .
germany last year pledged with other nations at the un summit in johannesburg last year to try and halve world poverty by the year 2015 . promoting peace the ded has come a long way from when kennedy attended the official ceremony founding the organization 40 years ago .
back then the ded sent around 100 specialists , including mechanics , farmers , engineers , nurses and doctors to libya , tanzania and chile . but the face of the agency has evolved over the years .
according to ded director jürgen wilhelm , it is no longer simply a case of sending skilled laborers overseas . " we have an increasing number of academic aid workers , either from commercial , administrative or social science backgrounds .
we also have lawyers working for our civil peace agency , who help to find missing persons in latin america , or who have administrative experience , " wilhelm told deutsche welle . these days some 75 percent of all ded volunteers are university graduates , not only from germany but from countries across the european union , and the average age has risen from 25 in 1973 around 40 these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the start of 2003 , the ded also dedicated its jubilee year to an initiative dubbed ' development for peace ' .
development minister wieczorek-zeul said the undertaking highlighted how the ded ’ s mission had extended beyond just battling poverty . " of course the fight against poverty is fundamental , as is allowing people to develop themselves .
but we have also , through the ded created the civil peace agency , which also requires its workers to actively stimulate peace , perhaps by means of mediation in a local conflict , or by the non-violent solution to a conflict , " she said . despite all the changes over the past four decades , the ethos behind the ded has remained the same .
at the core of the organization ’ s philosophy is still the aim to help people to help themselves . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate rages on german role in post-war iraq a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .

the proud tradition of german apprenticeships is under threat with the shortfall of trainee spots expected to hit 70,000 this autumn .

their decline in recent times is , in part , evidence of a wider problem plaguing germany 's skilled trades .
the country , once renowned and respected for its apprenticeship programs is facing a crisis as more and more young people seek in vain for traineeships as electricians , tailors and bakers .
it is a situation that may force the german government into drastic measures .
with 70,000 young people expected to have trouble finding an apprenticeship this year , german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened the business community with fines if more spots where not created voluntarily by autumn .
but germany 's economic and labor minister wolfgang clement on tuesday rejected a " education fee " for companies for now , urging instead for companies to make room for new trainees on their own .
he said chambers of commerce , employment associations , unions and business community needed to engage themselves fully to find a solution .

" the companies must know that with the apprenticeships they are securing their own future , ” clement said .
but the latest push by the government to get germany working and to build a future of economic stability around a well-trained , solid workforce has caused further disquiet within already despondent industry circles .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .
speaking at a united nations refugee commission event in berlin on monday , german interior minister , otto schilly said the comments were " in no way acceptable , " and called on the italian reform minister to formally review his statements . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejects legislation that would have become its first immigration law .

as germany 's largest foreign development aid agency , the deutsche entwicklungsdienst -lrb- ded -rrb- celebrates four decades of existence on tuesday , berlin has promised to keep the funds flowing so it can keep up the good work . founded on june 24 , 1963 , the deutsche entwicklungsdienst -lrb- ded -rrb- was modeled on the american peace corps , itself born out of u.s. president john f. kennedy 's idea to create a voluntary service for young people to help abroad . on tuesday , the ded observed its 40th anniversary in the presence of german president johannes rau , the minister for development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and several foreign dignitaries in bonn .
it was a happy occasion for an organization that over the years has sent more than 13,000 development aid workers to more than fifty countries in africa , asia and latin america “ the ded has played a very important role in making globalization more just , ” said wieczorek-zeul in a speech to around 500 guests . though helping to improve the economic and social welfare of the developing world is certainly reason enough to celebrate , the ded can also be pleased wieczorek-zeul and german finance minister hans eichel on monday agreed not to skimp on development aid , despite budget cuts at most of the other federal ministries . with this year 's development budget of nearly € 85 million -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- , the ded currently has the means to keep more than 1,000 aid workers in 45 countries worldwide .
wieczorek-zeul said budget cuts at the development ministry ’ s expense could make it difficult for germany to uphold its international commitments .
germany last year pledged with other nations at the un summit in johannesburg last year to try and halve world poverty by the year 2015 . promoting peace the ded has come a long way from when kennedy attended the official ceremony founding the organization 40 years ago .
back then the ded sent around 100 specialists , including mechanics , farmers , engineers , nurses and doctors to libya , tanzania and chile . but the face of the agency has evolved over the years .
according to ded director jürgen wilhelm , it is no longer simply a case of sending skilled laborers overseas . " we have an increasing number of academic aid workers , either from commercial , administrative or social science backgrounds .
we also have lawyers working for our civil peace agency , who help to find missing persons in latin america , or who have administrative experience , " wilhelm told deutsche welle . these days some 75 percent of all ded volunteers are university graduates , not only from germany but from countries across the european union , and the average age has risen from 25 in 1973 around 40 these days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul at the start of 2003 , the ded also dedicated its jubilee year to an initiative dubbed ' development for peace ' .
development minister wieczorek-zeul said the undertaking highlighted how the ded ’ s mission had extended beyond just battling poverty . " of course the fight against poverty is fundamental , as is allowing people to develop themselves .
but we have also , through the ded created the civil peace agency , which also requires its workers to actively stimulate peace , perhaps by means of mediation in a local conflict , or by the non-violent solution to a conflict , " she said . despite all the changes over the past four decades , the ethos behind the ded has remained the same .
at the core of the organization ’ s philosophy is still the aim to help people to help themselves . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate rages on german role in post-war iraq a heated debate has erupted in germany about its role in rebuilding post-war iraq .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .
" my main work was to dedicate myself to forgotten , politically persecuted artists , " she said .

the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .
two jewish art collectors from cologne have provided the impulse for the unique exhibition . german president johannes rau and israeli president mosche katzav presided over the unveiling of the bar-gera museum dedicated to persecuted art in the 20th century on sunday , june 22 , 2003 in the city of ashdod , israel .
named after a jewish couple , and passionate art collectors , kenda and jacob bar-gera , the museum is the first of its kind in the world and houses a vast collection of art that was banned in the former soviet union , under the nazi regime in germany and the fascist franco government in spain .
keeping alive the memory of the holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president johannes rau , right president rau -lrb- photo -rrb- paid tribute to the duo ’ s efforts to put together the collection .
" kenda and jacob bar-gera have not only given persecuted russian artists their lost respect back , but many german painters also thank them for their artistic rebirth , " he said .
kenda bar-gera , whose husband jacob died in january this year , is a survivor of the lodz and auschwitz nazi concentration camps .
she attended the opening ceremony on sunday .
" despite the atrocities inflicted upon you by the germans , you have extended your hand once again to my country and its people , " rau said .
the german president also said keeping alive the memory of the holocaust was the most important responsibility of his generation .
" we must always explain to our children what happened and how it could come to that , " he said .
the biggest collection of russian non-conformists the museum , located in a four-storied sprawling building of glass and sandstone with a view of the mediterranean , is home to over 340 works of art stemming from the 1930s to the 1980s .
most of them belong to the bar-gera collection that was meticulously built up over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bar-gera-museum in ashdod international museum for persecuted art the jewish pair -lrb- photo -rrb- , who divided their time between cologne and tel aviv , paid special attention to collecting works by artists of the second russian avant-garde or those artists who didn ’ t want to embrace the official art directive of the post-stalinist soviet union .
the paintings and other art objects were smuggled into germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats , traveling businessmen and students , thus making the bar-gera collection of russian non-conformists the largest of its kind in the world after the end of the cold war , the bar-gera collection piqued interest among several countries where the duo ’ s collected works originated from .
in 1996 , the collection was exhibited under the title " russian non-conformists " at the russian museum in st. petersburg .
it later traveled to moscow , frankfurt am main , leverkusen , verona , italy , and then to witten , germany .
" a child of persecution " the enthusiasm with which the collection was received led kenda and jacob bar-gera to search for a final permanent resting place for it .
they set up a foundation called " international museum for persecuted art – israel " , whose sole aim was to build a museum for the collection .
headed by prominent personalities from the fields of politics and arts , the foundation raised the necessary € 25 million through fund raising drives in europe , the u.s. and israel as well as through art auctions .
the bar-gera ’ s dream has finally been realized in the form of the museum in ashdod .
though jacob bar-gera did not live to see its opening , his wife kenda told news agency dpa that the art collection was the dominant factor in their lives .
" my main work was to dedicate myself to forgotten , politically persecuted artists , " she said .
" it had possibly to do with the fact , that i was myself a child of persecution .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .

as another boat carrying african immigrants docks on the italian coast , debate intensifies over just how europe should set about dealing with illegal immigrants bound for the northern shores of the mediterranean . the latest boat load of immigrants to arrive in europe reached the sicilian coastline at the beginning of the week under the cover of darkness .
sicilian coastguards occupied the boat before towing it to the port of porto palo , where the 150 immigrants , or ' clandestini ' as they are known locally , were taken to an emergency reception center for medical treatment .
italian authorities reported that two of those on board the ship were arrested on charges of human trafficking .
a european problem with the number of ' clandestini ' washing up on italy ’ s shores rising sharply over the past month , the issue of immigration has risen to the top of politician ’ s agendas .
but it is not only an italian problem .
in spain , authorities wrestle almost daily with a tide of illegal immigrants landing on its shores from countries in north and sub-saharan africa .
just this past sunday police stopped 143 people attempting to enter mainland spain via the canary islands .
in germany , where illegal immigrants from eastern europe frequently rely on holes in the border crossings to poland , a french-bound truck smuggling chinese and afghan immigrants was detained by polish customs officials on monday .
and in turkey , authorities on monday rounded up 244 would-be immigrants from afghanistan , china , iran and pakistan .
but it is in italy where the issue seems to be ruffling the most feathers .
part of this owes to the government ’ s attempts to focus on the crisis as italy prepares to take over the rotating european union presidency on july 1 .
an italian-european solution italian foreign minister franco frattini has called for the creation of transit camps in the mediterranean for illegal immigrants as a way of countering the wave of human traffic into europe .
the suggestion , which was first presented by britain ’ s prime minister tony blair at last week ’ s eu summit in greece , has met with strong criticism by human rights groups who say such camps are " unlawful . "
britain is nonetheless in favor of setting up at least a pilot project in europe , and italy seems to have the motivation to push forward on the plans .
speaking to the italian newspaper corriere della sera on monday , frattini said italy was willing to work to establish a maritime control center for the southeast mediterranean in cyprus " to house clandestine migrants stopped at sea until they are sent back to their home countries . "
the foreign minister also proposed setting up similar centers in malta with the cooperation of britain and spain .
in another effort to stem illegal immigration , frattini suggested that italy could offer a ' reward ' to countries which agree to prevent their citizens from attempting to cross the waters to italy .
" italy could increase legal immigration quotas from countries who succeed in stopping clandestine immigrants from leaving their shores .
it would be a sort of reward for good behavior , " the minister told the paper .
from the other side of the mediterranean , libyan leader muammar gaddafi responded to such suggestions with a warning to european leaders that african states would not stem the flow of illegal immigrants until the eu increases its cooperation with africa to alleviate poverty on the continent .
italian government at odds over immigration while the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi claims to have the immigration problem under control , the issue is causing a heated debate within the ranks of his coalition government .
italy 's reforms minister and head of the far-right northern league , umberto bossi , caused a storm last week when the corriere della sera quoted him as saying ' clandestini ' should be shot out of the water : " after the second or third warning , bang … we fire the cannon .
without too much talking .
a cannon to knock out whoever may be there .
otherwise we 're never going to end this problem . "
bossi , who has already threatened to withdraw his support from the conservative coalition unless immigration controls are toughened , is waging a tough battle .
" there comes a time when it is necessary to resort to the use of force , " the newspaper quoted him as saying .
since his interview was published , the far-right leader and number three man in the government has released a statement in which he insists the newspaper misinterpreted his views .
but the paper is standing firm , claiming it printed only the truth .
speaking at a united nations refugee commission event in berlin on monday , german interior minister , otto schilly said the comments were " in no way acceptable , " and called on the italian reform minister to formally review his statements . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejects legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigration dominates eu summit european union leaders reach agreement to combat illegal immigration and immigrant smuggling by operating joint border patrols .
the eu has also set a timeline for establishing a joint asylum policy .
treading immigration 's fine line in europe britain , spain and italy are lobbying for tougher measures to stem illegal immigration into the european union .

but that could be the tip of the iceberg as it is estimated a victim will be assaulted 35 times on average before reporting it to the police .
i think schools need to be educated more on the signs to pick up on michaela manville agencies working in devon to combat the problem are initially hoping to raise the number of reported incidents by 10 % through better early intervention .
one way they hope to do that is by training people like gps , teachers and social workers to recognise the signs .
dr peter jolliffe , chief officer of the devon local medical committee , welcomes any move to tackle the problem .
but he says there is more to it than identifying who the victim is .
" many gps , myself included , have felt an awful lot of frustration having gone along all the way one can in trying to assist such victims , only to be unsurprised to find they are back together with the person who abuses them , " he said .
after years of abuse , michaela manville fled from a brutal marriage .
early help she says early help is important .
" i used to walk round with bruises and the kids were really upset at school and nobody picked up on it .
" i think schools need to be educated more on the signs to pick up on , " she said .
a pilot scheme has been running for the last three months .
the project will be made permanent in september and will train 1,000 people a year across the county .

they are campaigning against a new £ 2.5 bn system , known as tetra - terrestrial trunked radio - which is currently being introduced throughout the uk to improve police communications .
although hailed as cutting-edge technology , some experts have raised health concerns about the new transmitters the radio system requires .
tetra masts pulse at 17.6hz which is very close to the 16hz frequency the government 's independent expert group on mobile phones warns might affect brain activity .
some studies have suggested that radio waves around this frequency could cause calcium to leak from the brain , triggering damage to the nervous and immune systems .
the long-term impact of living close to a tetra mast is just not known , and we are not prepared to take the risks for ourselves or our children diana frew fife resident diana frew is one of the campaigners asking the parliament to intervene over the introduction of tetra masts to the area .
she said : " the safety guidelines which exist for mobile phones do not apply to tetra .
" scientists and tests have confirmed that tetra masts pulse at 17.6hz , a frequency known to produce adverse health effects .
" the long-term impact of living close to a tetra mast is just not known , and we are not prepared to take the risks for ourselves or our children . "
green msp mark ruskell , who represents mid-scotland and fife , has tabled a motion calling for the introduction of the masts to be suspended .
' proper standards ' he said : " we all want an effective system of communication for the emergency services , but if that system has risks for police personnel and the public then it 's an absolute non-starter .
" with such widespread public and scientific concern , we should not be even contemplating the introduction of the tetra system into scotland until all the evidence has been scrutinised by the parliament and proper standards developed . "
alison mackay , who lives 200m from a proposed mast site on tarvit hill near cupar , added : " these masts are not safe , and the scottish executive needs to test them against adequate safety standards before they are unleashed on the public . "
the scottish executive said guidance had been issued to councils on taking health considerations into account during applications for radio masts .
