in germany , right-wing extremism still lures young , often alienated people into a grip of hate and violence that 's difficult to escape .
but one program started by a former neo-nazi shows people a possible way out . ingo hasselbach knows what it feels like to be caught in a vicious cycle of hate against everything and everyone who 's different .
he also knows what it feels like to have that hate turn against you .
he 's been there . hasselbach was a member of germany 's neo-nazi scene for 25 years . but ten years ago he turned his back on the skinheads and rejected their gospel of racism and xenophobia .
when he did that , he lost friendships he had had for a quarter of a century .
when he stopped defining himself by right-wing ideology , his entire social world collapsed .
but , he says , it was a sacrifice he had to make .
that is the hardest message to get across to the young , mostly male neo-nazis who contact exit , a program he founded to help people successfully get out of the right-wing scene . " it 's important to make clear to the boys who come to exit that they have to get out of their social environment , " hasselbach says .
" in some cases they have to even move to another city .
they have to be prepared to do this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo hasselbach hasselbach -lrb- photo -rrb- founded exit two years ago because he knew how difficult , and dangerous , it could be to leave the right-wing scene once one has been a part of it .
making the decision to step away from extremism often means stepping into social isolation and enduring the wrath and even violence of former friends who consider it treachery to leave the scene . taking the first steps most of the young people who call the exit hotline are between 17 and 27 years old .
before they can get help from the program , however , they have to fulfil a few requirements .
they must be calling on their own free will ; they must be willing to talk about their experiences in the scene ; and they have to take responsibility for their actions and behavior during their time with the far-right .
once they 've agreed , exit helps them take their first steps in a new world . those steps include introducing the person to a possible new group of friends , putting him in contact with the employment office and if necessary , the police or a lawyer .
exit 's goal is to create a completely new foundation for the former neo-nazi . " it 's like the person falls into a black hole and does n't really have anyone anymore , " hasselbach said .
" the scene has a cult-like character to it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exit germany during its two-year existence , exit has helped some 200 people leave the far-right behind .
hasselbach is proud of that figure , especially given the fact that the organization is privately run and receives its funding from private sources . moving on but after ten years of helping right-wing youth turn their lives around , and even consulting on the german film " führer-ex , " which tells the story of two neo-nazis around the time the berlin wall fell , hasselbach has decided to pass the baton along to someone else and leave behind his neo-nazi past completely . " at some point it become clear to me , that i do n't want to be a professional ex-nazi , " he said . security concerns played a role in his decision as well .
helping pull people away from violence-prone groups has its dangers , and hasselbach is none too popular in the far-right community .
now that he has two kids , he is ready for a line of work that is a little further removed from the line of fire . " and it 's also time to catch up on all those things , like my professional development , that i 've let sit for the past ten years , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de showing neo-nazis the way out a year ago the german ministry of the interior created a program to help right-wing youths leave the extremist scene .
today , the results are sobering : hardly a neo-nazi has used the program .

zhang qi was held in the city of chengdu after allegedly being kidnapped by chinese police inside vietnam along with veteran us-based dissident wang bingzhang and another activist .
her release comes a day after wang lost an appeal in a chinese court against a life jail sentence imposed for espionage and terrorism .
ms zhang was freed from chengdu on saturday , and has now arrived in new york city , the us-based free china movement said .
wang was found guilty of providing intelligence to taiwan between 1982 and 1990 and obtaining " secret military material illegally " in exchange for money .
kidnapped by agents human rights groups say that miss zhang and wang , along with french-based dissident wu yue , who has already been released , were abducted by chinese agents at a hotel inside vietnam , where they were trying to meet chinese labour leaders .
they were then apparently bundled across the border .
zhang qi went missing with wang bingzhang in vietnam the trio were reported missing in june last year , but it was only months later , following repeated appeals by overseas rights groups , that they were they found to be in chinese police custody .
the chinese authorities ' version is that police found them tied up at a temple on the chinese side after being kidnapped by a criminal gang .
as a permanent us resident , wang 's case has attracted the attention of the us state department and congress , which have called for his freedom .
lian shengde , the free china movement 's executive director , told the afp news agency that ms zhang 's release had been delayed until after wang 's trial , to avoid attracting publicity about the background to his case .
" she knew details about the kidnappings , and they did n't want her to speak to the world before wang 's sentencing , " he said .

the amnesty will run from 31 march to 30 april .
the public will be urged to hand over illegally held firearms without fear of prosecution in order to help remove the weapons from circulation .
the amnesty will coincide with a similar initiative taking place between the same dates in england and wales .
these types of weapons are a source of considerable concern in our communities jim wallace justice minister first minister jack mcconnell said : " the last gun amnesty , which followed the dunblane tragedy in 1996 , saw 23,000 firearms surrendered in the uk .
" that was 23,000 lethal weapons removed from circulation and the possibility that they could ever cause serious harm .
" i hope that the amnesty which begins later this month will help rid our streets of more illegally held guns and help improve public safety in scotland . "
justice minister jim wallace added : " i hope the removal of the threat of prosecution will encourage people to come forward and hand over illegal , unregistered or unwanted firearms in their possession .
replica guns " the police will also be encouraging people to hand in the replica guns and air guns that are used in many firearms crimes in scotland .
" these types of weapons are a source of considerable concern in our communities and it is in everyone 's interest that there is less of them in circulation . "
the lord advocate , colin boyd qc , said : " during the amnesty people who hand in illegal guns will not be prosecuted for unlawful possession under the firearms act 1968 .
immunity for possession " i have issued an instruction to procurators fiscal not to take proceedings for illegal possession of firearms and shotguns .
" the immunity will not cover other offences involving the use of firearms " the association of chief police officers in scotland -lrb- acpos -rrb- has also backed the initiative .
fife constabulary 's deputy chief constable david mellor said : " whilst firearms problems are less serious in scotland than elsewhere in the uk , acpos welcomes the opportunity to contribute to making the forthcoming amnesty a success by removing firearms from circulation and making scotland safer .
