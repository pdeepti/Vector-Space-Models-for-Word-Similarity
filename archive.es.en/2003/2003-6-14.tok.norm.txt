fearon , who has more than 30 criminal convictions , was shot by martin during a burglary at the farmer 's home in emneth huntgate , norfolk , in august 1999 .
martin shot dead fearon 's 16-year-old accomplice fred barras , leading to a conviction for manslaughter .

fearon , who has more than 30 criminal convictions , was shot by martin during a burglary at the farmer 's home in emneth huntgate , norfolk , in august 1999 .

on saturday , mark and philip wilson dedicated their awards to the volunteers who helped them , as well as the expatriate community on the indonesian island .
as british honorary consul to bali and assistant honorary consul , the brothers , originally from burnley , lancashire , led a team of volunteers in the aftermath of the attack last year .
more than 200 people , including around 27 britons , were killed when two car bombs exploded outside the sari club in the island 's kuta district on 12 october .
the brothers co-ordinated the production of a list of britons who were missing or confirmed dead , by visiting every hotel on the island , and comforting relatives and victims .
for me the award is recognition for a whole team of people who volunteered mark wilson mark , 56 , honorary consul , said he was " very grateful " for being honoured with the award .
however , he said : " it would have been nice if we had earned it in different circumstances .
" my feeling was always that if there was going to be any recognition for what we did , it should have been given to 64 volunteers who came to help .
" for me the award is recognition for a whole team of people who volunteered .
" it was an incredible effort from everybody and i guess that the other britons on the island see me - as the honorary consul - as their representative for the community .
' knocked out ' " and in my role i will accept and dedicate the award to them . "
philip , 55 , who married in february , said he was " totally knocked out " by the recognition the pair had received .
" i 'm overwhelmed by it all , " he said .
" we just had a job to do - we stepped up and we did it . "
four other britons who live on the island have been honoured with mbes .
other people honoured in lancashire include a knights bachelor for william taylor , leader of blackburn with darwen borough council .
lilian doris thompson , the 100-year-old chairman of blackpool pleasure beach ltd , has also been awarded an obe for her services to the community .
it follows on from the mbe she was awarded 30 years ago .

us president george w bush is among the world leaders expected to attend .
western embassies and tourist centres in the thai capital were the targets of the plot , thaksin shinawatra said in his weekly radio address to the nation .
he said a singaporean man arrested last month and handed over to the authorities in singapore had admitted to planning the attacks , although he gave no further details .
three thai muslims were also arrested this week on suspicion of involvement in the plot .
suspect map a bangkok tourist map with apparent targets circled on it - reportedly including the embassies of the united states , britain , israel , australia and singapore - was among the evidence seized from the three thai suspects , according to the associated press news agency .
for months , the thai prime minister has been insisting there was no possibility of a terrorist attack in thailand .
media reports of islamic militant activity in thailand were , he said , the work of " crazy people " .
but on saturday morning , mr thaksin surprised everyone by announcing the most ambitious plot to attack western targets in asia since the bali bomb last year .
the meeting of heads of state from the 21 asia pacific economic co-operation -lrb- apec -rrb- member states will run from 20-21 october .
president bush is scheduled to attend .
the suspect , a singaporean muslim , was arrested in thailand last month and is since alleged to have admitted being a member of the shadowy islamic organisation , jemaah islamiyah .
but the police withheld news of his arrest until this week , just as mr thaksin was meeting president george w bush in washington .
thai police say they are now on the hunt for more members of the militant cell , including a man they say they believe is the bomb-maker .
muslim scepticism the us has for months been pressing thailand to take more action against militants inside its borders .
the authorities have also detained three muslim men from southern thailand who they say are involved in the plot .
however , they have so far produced little evidence and the arrests have been greeted with scepticism by muslim politicians and community leaders in thailand .
they believe the arrests are instead linked to a long-running conflict between thailand 's muslim minority and the police .
