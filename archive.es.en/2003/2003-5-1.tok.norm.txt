foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east . the aegean sea might conjure up images of lazy days in the sun , but eu foreign ministers are expected to clash when they get together on rhodes on friday for two days of talks .

although the heads of state made some headway during the summit on eu expansion some two weeks ago - concurring that the united nations should quickly begin to play the central role in iraq - they are still a long way off from actually settling their differences . the eu is sure to play second fiddle to the united states both in iraq and in the middle east peace process - also on the agenda .

foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east . the aegean sea might conjure up images of lazy days in the sun , but eu foreign ministers are expected to clash when they get together on rhodes on friday for two days of talks .

foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east . the aegean sea might conjure up images of lazy days in the sun , but eu foreign ministers are expected to clash when they get together on rhodes on friday for two days of talks .

although the heads of state made some headway during the summit on eu expansion some two weeks ago - concurring that the united nations should quickly begin to play the central role in iraq - they are still a long way off from actually settling their differences . the eu is sure to play second fiddle to the united states both in iraq and in the middle east peace process - also on the agenda .

foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east . the aegean sea might conjure up images of lazy days in the sun , but eu foreign ministers are expected to clash when they get together on rhodes on friday for two days of talks .

foreign ministers of the european union are scheduled to meet on the picturesque greek island of rhodes on friday for some tough talking about defense , iraq and the middle east . the aegean sea might conjure up images of lazy days in the sun , but eu foreign ministers are expected to clash when they get together on rhodes on friday for two days of talks .
the main bone of contention will be recent proposals from france , germany , belgium and luxembourg to breath life into the joint eu security and defense policy . " the process of working together will force them to try to reconcile their views , instead of letting the fissures widen into ravines , as they did on iraq , " analyst helen grabbe of the london-based center for european reform told reuters . the 25 heads of state - including the leaders of the ten countries pegged to join the union next year - will discuss suggestions from a controversial " mini-summit " earlier this week in brussels by the four eu countries that most vehemently opposed the war against iraq . the leaders of france , germany , belgium and luxembourg proposed creating an independent eu military headquarters to oversee the european rapid reaction force , as well as improving and intensifying european military cooperation . after taking flack for their exclusive meeting , the four emphasized that other eu members were welcome to be part of the new european defense and security union , particularly with an eye to britain , the strongest military might in the alliance of states . but britain and the united states have already warned against creating a european military bloc that would compete with nato , despite assurances from the brussels four that their aim is to strengthen the european contribution to the north atlantic military alliance . rebuilding iraq the politicians will also turn their attention to iraq , the source of massive discord within the alliance in past months .
the main issue will be reaching agreement on how the union can be part of rebuilding iraq .
although the heads of state made some headway during the summit on eu expansion some two weeks ago - concurring that the united nations should quickly begin to play the central role in iraq - they are still a long way off from actually settling their differences . the eu is sure to play second fiddle to the united states both in iraq and in the middle east peace process - also on the agenda .
but the europeans are anxious to have their say , and the more european leaders can sculpt joint positions on important issues , the smoother things will go on june 25 , when the eu-u.s. summit takes place .

" the general consensus was that i was mad as a brush , " says simon buckingham , describing the reaction of his vodafone colleagues when he decided to go it alone .
small business , big ideas the uk 's first ever national small business week has highlighted the contribution made by smaller companies to the economy .
in a new series , bbc news online profiles entrepreneurs and examines some of the challenges facing small business .
" i realised that no-one else was going to take the risk with me .
but the result is that i owned 100 % of the company . "
that company - mobile streams - began life as a research business in 1998 , when simon published " data on sms " , one of the industry 's first guides to text messaging .
five years later , it is a multi-million pound mobile content business , with offices on both sides of the atlantic and contracts with all the major mobile operators .
and simon is still only 29 years old .
a consuming passion timing and knowledge , suggests simon , are the keys to his success . "
i realised we 'd made it when we could see the money coming in but could n't spend it fast enough " simon buckingham mobile streams in 1992 , while being sponsored through university by vodafone , simon saw the first ever text message being sent .
" i had no idea what an impact this would have on my life .
i could see the future , i felt that text messaging was going to be very , very big . "
simon then graduated and was appointed vodafone 's product manager for text messaging .
but he had a growing sense that text messaging was something he wanted to spend more time on , outside the confines of a large organisation .
online reach so in 1998 his " madness " got the better of him .
he left vodafone and wrote " data on sms " , which he published and distributed via the internet .
getting started " a good business plan is probably more important than it was a couple of years ago because investors have become very cautious " nigel piercy cranfield school of management within a few months , it had sold 30,000 copies .
" whatever people say about the internet , there 's no way i could have done this without it . "
by the third day of its online publication , nokia had ordered enough copies to give one to each of its engineers - a single order was worth $ 2,500 .
" i thought i was in heaven . "
the guru reports were just the beginning .
for every copy sold , someone was looking for an explanation , some kind of consultancy .
" timing played its part again - text messaging was just taking off and the industry was looking for a guru to explain it . "
simon filled the role , taking a trip twice around the world to discuss his ideas with network operators , messaging vendors and key players in silicon valley , such as palm .
" i did a one-day workshop for their staff to put together their mobile strategy ahead of their ipo .
" i got paid £ 20,000 for one day 's work , " he says , recounting the heady days of his first real financial success .
" it was the dotcom megaboom and people were making out like bandits . "
magic number but taking three-month trips around the world was exhausting and , however lucrative , not sustainable .
in 2000 it was time for change in mobile streams ' strategic direction .
simon decided to register 700 internet domain names , related to all things sms and text-messaging .
one website - ringtones.com - became was what simon describes as " the golden nugget " .
the nugget spiralled and " mobile content " - ringtones , operator logos and pictures - became the second arm of mobile streams .
" this was the best .
i had four people in my flat - me at the desk , a friend on the sofa , another at the top of the stairs , and one at the bottom , shipping out orders .
" it was the boom time .
the money was pouring in and we had no responsibility . "
mobile streams attracted the attention of heavy-hitters , such as nokia and orange who asked the company to supply ringtones and services to their brands .
" it was going off like gangbusters . "
ringing up the sales the business now has publishing deals with nine large music groups - including emi , bmg and the association of composers , artists and publishers -lrb- acap -rrb- .
in turn , these deals allow mobile streams to license content to 50 companies , including vodafone , bt , samsung and sonera 2 . "
never hire a friend ... the minute you start ordering a friend around , they cease to be a friend " simon buckingham chances are , if you download your favourite avril lavgne song to your mobile , mobile streams is ringing up another sale .
the company 's recent expansion into the us has also secured partners such as wal-mart , the world 's biggest retailer .
for every mobile phone sold , customers get a package of free ringtones supplied by none other than mobile streams .
lessons learnt but surely it ca n't all have been plain sailing ?
" never hire a friend , " says simon , when asked if there 's anything he would have done differently .
" the minute you start ordering a friend around , they cease to be a friend . "
it has also been what simon calls a " consuming passion " .
he has no house , no car , no girlfriend .
but he is making money 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
" i realised we 'd made it when we could see the money coming in but could n't spend it fast enough .
" we did it the hard way but now we 're going to reap the rewards . "

richard branson , stelios haji-ioannou , james dyson or anita roddick ?

the nugget spiralled and " mobile content " - ringtones , operator logos and pictures - became the second arm of mobile streams .
" this was the best .
i had four people in my flat - me at the desk , a friend on the sofa , another at the top of the stairs , and one at the bottom , shipping out orders .
" it was the boom time .
the money was pouring in and we had no responsibility . "
mobile streams attracted the attention of heavy-hitters , such as nokia and orange who asked the company to supply ringtones and services to their brands .
" it was going off like gangbusters . "
ringing up the sales the business now has publishing deals with nine large music groups - including emi , bmg and the association of composers , artists and publishers -lrb- acap -rrb- .
in turn , these deals allow mobile streams to license content to 50 companies , including vodafone , bt , samsung and sonera 2 .
never hire a friend ... the minute you start ordering a friend around , they cease to be a friend simon buckingham chances are , if you download your favourite avril lavgne song to your mobile , mobile streams is ringing up another sale .
the company 's recent expansion into the us has also secured partners such as wal-mart , the world 's biggest retailer .
for every mobile phone sold , customers get a package of free ringtones supplied by none other than mobile streams .
lessons learnt but surely it ca n't all have been plain sailing ?
" never hire a friend , " says simon , when asked if there 's anything he would have done differently .
" the minute you start ordering a friend around , they cease to be a friend . "
it has also been what simon calls a " consuming passion " .
he has no house , no car , no girlfriend .
but he is making money 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
" i realised we 'd made it when we could see the money coming in but could n't spend it fast enough .
" we did it the hard way but now we 're going to reap the rewards . "
