a favorite of chancellors , pop stars and any native son in germany 's capital , currywurst is the real berlin treat . which german food has been the subject of a rock ballad , at least one play and two books , and is a favorite of chancellor gerhard schröder ?
be prepared for the wurst .
currywurst , that is .
currywurst , the ultimate german street food , is designed to be scarfed down while standing on a street corner after a late night on the town - and don ’ t forget one last beer chaser .
yet schröder recently ordered the " literarische currywurst " during a state visit from u.s. president george w. bush at theodor tücher 's restaurant on berlin 's historic pariser platz .
and after madonna was snapped eating one during her last tour of germany , the editor of berlin 's tabloid bild newspaper said it had all the traits of a good story : a celebrity and currywurst .

when curry meets ketchup indeed , a glance through the press archives shows that anybody who is somebody is offered a currywurst , and the accompanying photo op , at some point during their visit to the german capital , just as visiting dignitaries to new york stop and order " one with everything " at the local hot dog stand .
a skinless pork sausage smothered in curry-laced ketchup , currywurst is sometimes served whole but most often chopped into bite-sized morsels and eaten off a flimsy paper plate .
it costs about € 2.50 -lrb- $ 2.65 -rrb- .
currywurst stands can be found in all german cities , but the snack is especially associated with berlin , where even prior to unification it was popular on both sides of the wall .
ok , so we know that everyone loves currywurst .
but curry , that famous export-blend of indian spices , is alien to the german palate .
so where did it come from , and who makes the best ?
what are the secrets and mysteries behind this icon of pop food-culture ?
how the currywurst came to berlin in his novella-turned-play , the discovery of currywurst , hamburg-born writer uwe timm answers the question of the iconic treat ’ s origins with questions of his own .
" most people doubt that currywurst was ever actually invented , let alone by one person in particular , " writes timm .
" is n't it just like those myths , fairy-tales , and legends , the type dreamed up by legions of storytellers , not just one ?
did anybody invent the meatball , the boulette ?
are these dishes not collective achievements ? "
in the end , however , timm posits that the currywurst does have a specific origin and can be traced to a single individual – who , not surprisingly , comes from his home town .
according to timm , the currywurst was created by hamburg kiosk owner lena brücker at the end of world war ii .
sadly , timm notes , she took the secret of her special sausage spices to the grave .
patent number 721319 this version of events is , of course , an affront to any real berliner .
berlin legend has it that herta heuwer invented the currywurst , on september 4 , 1949 – and patented it under number 721319 .
she has since passed away , so we may never know where the ubiquitous snack had its origins .
the quintessential berlin imbiß , or takeaway stand , is konnopke 's , in the former east berlin .
it 's been going strong under family management since 1930 .
located under the tracks of the u2 subway at eberswalder strasse station in schönhauser allee , the little shop has the status of an institution , and gets regular mention in the press .
the shop is now run by waltraud ziervogel , who took it over from her father .
according to ziervogel , her father " introduced skinless bratwurst – today 's currywurst – to east berlin in 1960 .
we continued to sell it and i took over my dad 's business in 1976 , and i 've been doing it under his name ever since . "
ketchup is the key the secret of her success , ziervogel says , is the ketchup .
" the currywurst has to be tasty of course .
but the key is making your own ketchup , " she says .
more details are not forthcoming , however .

are these dishes not collective achievements ? "
in the end , however , timm posits that the currywurst does have a specific origin and can be traced to a single individual – who , not surprisingly , comes from his home town .
according to timm , the currywurst was created by hamburg kiosk owner lena brücker at the end of world war ii .
sadly , timm notes , she took the secret of her special sausage spices to the grave .

a favorite of chancellors , pop stars and any native son in germany 's capital , currywurst is the real berlin treat . which german food has been the subject of a rock ballad , at least one play and two books , and is a favorite of chancellor gerhard schröder ?
be prepared for the wurst .
currywurst , that is .
currywurst , the ultimate german street food , is designed to be scarfed down while standing on a street corner after a late night on the town - and don ’ t forget one last beer chaser .
yet schröder recently ordered the " literarische currywurst " during a state visit from u.s. president george w. bush at theodor tücher 's restaurant on berlin 's historic pariser platz .
and after madonna was snapped eating one during her last tour of germany , the editor of berlin 's tabloid bild newspaper said it had all the traits of a good story : a celebrity and currywurst .
herbert groenemeyer , germany 's answer to bruce springsteen , even wrote a song in honor of the homegrown snack .
when curry meets ketchup indeed , a glance through the press archives shows that anybody who is somebody is offered a currywurst , and the accompanying photo op , at some point during their visit to the german capital , just as visiting dignitaries to new york stop and order " one with everything " at the local hot dog stand .
a skinless pork sausage smothered in curry-laced ketchup , currywurst is sometimes served whole but most often chopped into bite-sized morsels and eaten off a flimsy paper plate .
it costs about € 2.50 -lrb- $ 2.65 -rrb- .
currywurst stands can be found in all german cities , but the snack is especially associated with berlin , where even prior to unification it was popular on both sides of the wall .
ok , so we know that everyone loves currywurst .
but curry , that famous export-blend of indian spices , is alien to the german palate .
so where did it come from , and who makes the best ?
what are the secrets and mysteries behind this icon of pop food-culture ?
how the currywurst came to berlin in his novella-turned-play , the discovery of currywurst , hamburg-born writer uwe timm answers the question of the iconic treat ’ s origins with questions of his own .

set in the notorious los angeles district south central , sophie fiennes film follows the reverend noel jones from christmas to easter and takes an upbeat look at life through the congregation of greater bethany church .
hoover street revival is directed and produced by sophie fiennes - sister of actors ralph and joseph .
and sophie fiennes was live on breakfast this morning click here for our interview with sophie fiennes publicity for the film describes it as unique and innovative . " it takes as its subject life , death and the word of god as experienced around greater bethany community church . "
the pastor noel jones is brother of singer grace jones , and music plays a big part in the film .
there are mesmerising gospel sequences with music heard sung or played in the background of the real life sequences .
sophie fiennes first visited the church in 1998 .
" greater bethany was referred to me on account of its choirs and musicians , " says fiennes .
" what i had not expected was the additional revelation of the preacher , bishop noel jones , whose charisma , cognitive metaphysics and mesmerising vocal rhythms had me glued to my chair , even as everyone else around me stamped their feet up and down the aisles " this seemed to redefine what church could be , and what theatre might once have been . "
when fiennes first approached the pastor , she had no funding and no backing from a broadcaster , but he gave permission saying he was fascinated by her ambition and intention to catch the spirit of the church .
filming took place in three blocks from april 2000 and she continued the search for financial backing .
it took until the film was being edited for the funding to be finally secured .
she managed to gain the confidence of the local community , and one member of the congregation kept an eye on her as the filming took fiennes to some dangerous areas .
biography , sophie fiennes fiennes was born in 1967 , she took a foundation course in painting at the chelsea school of art before working on film and television projects including peter greenaway 's the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover .
she 's also worked as a storyboard artist , written articles and made short experimental films on super 8 film , and video .

professor stephen knight has amassed a library of books and videos and lectures on two university courses about the noble outlaw who famously robbed the rich to give to the poor .
but his conclusion shoots a poison arrow through the belief in a real-life robin - with a band of merry men - who fell for maid marion .
instead he claims the robin hood " myth " is reinvented when people feel they are being oppressed by their own version of the sheriff of nottingham .
the 62-year-old cardiff university lecturer said : " if there was a mr r hood with an address in sheffield , yorkshire or nottinghamshire , what would that mean ?
" the obsession with identifying the ' real robin hood ' is futile and misguided .

" the genuine robin hood is a world-wide figure of myth - he represents a utopian vision of liberty which tends to thrive especially in illiberal contexts like the late 17th century , the early 19th century and most recently , the 1980s . "
he said his students study 15th century texts , 17th century ballards and film interperations of the story , right up to modern television series which depicted a feminist robin listening attentively to an assertive maid marion .

he said that image was based on the victorian stage plays where robin 's part would have been played by a woman , and she would have worn tights to show off her legs .

a report from the audit commission found that , on average , trusts cancel 6 % of planned operations within a week of the intended admission date , often for non-clinical reason such as the lack of a suitable bed , no theatre time or no surgeon or anaesthetist .
one in five of those cancellations takes place after the patient has been admitted , the commission found .
and around 10 % of operating sessions currently have to be cancelled due to lack of staff or bed space .
many of the solutions are relatively simple james strachan , audit commission the audit commission said while some hospital trusts would benefit from investment to provide more operating theatres or beds , many simply needed to look at new ways of using the resources they already had .
its report also found one in 10 trusts cancels 20 % of outpatient appointments , often because staff have not given enough warning they will not be available .
another 10 % of appointments are cancelled because the patient fails to turn up .
lack of staff there are also wide variations in the amount of time operating theatres are used each week .
one in four trusts was found to use their operating theatres for just 65 % of the time .
the audit commission said this could often be down to theatres not being ready for the start of operating sessions , and doctors and patients not being there on time .
it estimates a well-used unit would average around 40 hours a week .
but the figures reported ranged from eight to 57 hours a week .
other factors , such as not admitting non-urgent patients in the order in which they came onto the waiting list meaning some patients waited longer than they needed to , also needed to be addressed , the audit commission said .
it recommended combining doctor 's individual lists into lists for specialties and making better use of beds by speeding up the diagnosis , treatment and the discharge of emergency patients to help hospitals run more efficiently .
variation the report looked at four areas of hospital care ; operating theatres , bed management , outpatient services and waiting lists .
one 190 trusts across england and wales took part in the evaluation .
james strachan , chairman of the audit commission said managers and doctors had to work together to improve the running of hospitals .
he added : " the variation in performance is too wide and many trusts could deliver better services if they managed their exiting resources more effectively .
" the reports show that many of the solutions are relatively simple .
" we support the need for additional resources and freedoms in the nhs , but call on the government to ensure that trusts can demonstrate that they make the best use of their existing capacity before being allocated extra resources . "

one in five of those cancellations takes place after the patient has been admitted , the commission found .
and around 10 % of operating sessions currently have to be cancelled due to lack of staff or bed space . "
many of the solutions are relatively simple " james strachan , audit commission the audit commission said while some hospital trusts would benefit from investment to provide more operating theatres or beds , many simply needed to look at new ways of using the resources they already had .
its report also found one in 10 trusts cancels 20 % of outpatient appointments , often because staff have not given enough warning they will not be available .
another 10 % of appointments are cancelled because the patient fails to turn up .
lack of staff there are also wide variations in the amount of time operating theatres are used each week .
one in four trusts was found to use their operating theatres for just 65 % of the time .
the audit commission said this could often be down to theatres not being ready for the start of operating sessions , and doctors and patients not being there on time .
it estimates a well-used unit would average around 40 hours a week .
but the figures reported ranged from eight to 57 hours a week .
other factors , such as not admitting non-urgent patients in the order in which they came onto the waiting list meaning some patients waited longer than they needed to , also needed to be addressed , the audit commission said .
it recommended combining doctor 's individual lists into lists for specialties and making better use of beds by speeding up the diagnosis , treatment and the discharge of emergency patients to help hospitals run more efficiently .
variation the report looked at four areas of hospital care ; operating theatres , bed management , outpatient services and waiting lists .
one 190 trusts across england and wales took part in the evaluation .
james strachan , chairman of the audit commission said managers and doctors had to work together to improve the running of hospitals .
he added : " the variation in performance is too wide and many trusts could deliver better services if they managed their exiting resources more effectively .
" the reports show that many of the solutions are relatively simple .
" we support the need for additional resources and freedoms in the nhs , but call on the government to ensure that trusts can demonstrate that they make the best use of their existing capacity before being allocated extra resources . "
investment a spokesperson for the department of health said the nhs was making progress .
but she added : " we recognise that there are still improvements to be made .
" we need to continue to invest in the nhs and reform the service , to ensure these improvements are made across the nhs and for the long term . "
shadow health secretary liam fox said : " before the government throws any more cash at the nhs , they must ensure that they are making efficient use of current resources . "

if drainpipes make a sudden fashion comeback i 'm going to be in serious trouble being able to walk short distances seemed to highlight the long way i 've still got to go .
in the hot weather the artificial limb pulled and rubbed against my skin , making walking slow and uncomfortable .
after a few hundred metres i could n't wait to take it off .
while i was in a wheelchair or using crutches i could look forward to an imaginary day when i 'd be given the artificial leg .
in my mind i hoped i 'd be able to leap up immediately and run a marathon .
now i 've got the leg , though , i realise there 's a whole new set of hurdles to overcome .
it 's as though i 've completed that imaginary marathon only to find i have to return to the starting line and start all over again .
one thing that helps dispel the doubts is the simple pleasure of seeing two feet poking out of the bottom of my trouser legs .
wardrobe problem it does n't seem to matter that one of those feet is made of carbon fibre and plastic .
simply being able to go about my business without the curious stares and questions that my empty trouser leg attracted is compensation enough .
for the first time since my accident i look just the same as everyone else .
one hurdle i have n't yet overcome , though , is what to do about my wardrobe .

a nondescript industrial estate in the san fernando valley on the outskirts of los angeles may be an unlikely place to start another iranian revolution .
but woodland hills , california , is the headquarters of the satellite television station national iranian tv -lrb- nitv -rrb- whose programmes are beamed into tehran and other parts of iran to illegal satellite dishes in private homes .
it is one of half a dozen satellite stations set up by iranian exiles in the united states .
nitv is run by zia ataby , a former pop star who moved to los angeles in the 1980s .
it says it aims to promote " equality between men and women , separation of religion from government , human rights , freedom of speech and the media , and democracy " in iran and is not affiliated with any political party .
its combination of light entertainment , talk shows and politics has proved explosive in iran . "
nitv for the iranian government is more dangerous than america or other countries and that is why they have tried anything to cut our voice " zia ataby , founder , nitv this week former iranian president ali akbar rafsanjani warned iranians " not to be trapped by the evil television stations that america has established " .
and some outside observers believe that the exile community and its stations are playing a key role in the student protests that are sweeping the country .
on wednesday president george w bush expressed his support for the protesters , calling them " courageous souls who speak out for freedom " , adding : " america stands squarely by their side . "
stirring up trouble ?
al santoli of the washington-based american foreign policy council says that the foreign broadcasts - and the internet - are playing a similar role to programmes beamed to eastern europe just before the end of the cold war .
" the protests are being driven by young people who have enough exposure to the outside world to know there is something different " from the repressive iranian regime , he told the bbc . "
i am not surprised that students and others in tehran responded to the call " majid mosleh , iranian lecturer in us " it is very important that people know that there are others who share their protests , especially when the official media are censored , " he added .
mr ataby told reuters news agency : " nitv for the iranian government is more dangerous than america or other countries and that is why they have tried anything to cut our voice . "
he says his eight telephone lines and four fax lines are continually besieged by comments from viewers in iran .
" i am not surprised that students and others in tehran responded to the call , " said majid mosleh , an iranian who teaches political science at college of the canyons in los angeles .
and reports from iran suggest that the regime is moving to block access to western internet sites for the estimated three million iranians with access to the web .
meanwhile , radio stations like ksri , also los angeles-based , are circulating petitions calling for the iranian regime to be replaced by a democratic and secular one .
would us aid help ?
us neo-conservatives would like to provide direct aid to the exile radio and tv stations , which are mainly funded by donations from wealthy exiles .
republican senator sam brownback - who was also a strong supporter of iraqi exile leader ahmed chalabi - has proposed that the us congress provide $ 50m to fund iranian exile groups and stations . "
to imply there is going to be a us intervention , or depict the regime as being weak , may give false hopes to these idealistic young students " professor richard dekmejian but others warn that too close an identification with the united states could be counter-productive for the iranian opposition movement .
" it 's very important at this critical juncture that the opposition should be seen as independent of the united states , especially after the iraq war , " said mr santoli .
otherwise the hardliners would have the excuse they needed for a crackdown , he added .
and others warned of the talk shows fuelling unrealistic expectations among the protesters .
" to imply there is going to be a us intervention , or depict the regime as being weak , may give false hopes to these idealistic young students , " said richard dekmejian , professor of political science at the university of southern california .
but their influence may be growing within the us among right-wing policy-makers .
political exiles have often played an important role in us politics - not just in eastern europe , but also in regard to cuba where an active exile community in miami has gained a dominant role in us foreign policy towards the island .
the iranian exiles may be no more than enthusiastic cheerleaders for democracy , but one way or another they may yet end up playing a key role in the unfolding events in tehran .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- gay bombay comes out bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 19 june 2003 , 06:24 gmt 07:24 uk gay bombay comes out by zubair ahmed bbc correspondent in bombay a new book celebrating forbidden love between homosexual men in india has raised hopes within the country 's largely invisible gay community of the chances of coming out of the closet .
the boyfriend deals with love between an openly gay man and a young boy who feels unable to pursue his gay instincts , just like millions of other indian men .
it is an unusual storyline with an unusual theme in a country where homosexuality remains a punishable offence .
a 141-year-old law prohibits " unnatural " sexual acts .
the book is being seen as a symbol of the growing confidence of indian gay men , best exemplified by their public behaviour in the western indian city of bombay -lrb- mumbai -rrb- .
r raj rao , the book 's author , says the gay community wants the law to be repealed , but is still not vocal enough to demand its rights .
" there 's a need to politicise the issues , " he says .
" unless that happens there 's little hope for the gay community . "
" here in mumbai i can hold hands with my boyfriend and walk around , which is not possible even on the streets of new york and london " mohammad yunus there are no official estimates for india 's gay community , but some gay organisations say it may be as large as 50 million people .
" here in mumbai i can hold hands with my boyfriend and walk around , which is not possible even on the streets of new york and london , " says mohammad yunus , a gay man who lives in mumbai .
he believes one in 10 bombay residents in a city of 15 million is gay .
" what 's changed is that our profile has been raised , " says vikram doctor of gay bombay , an organisation that says it creates safe spaces for gays .
thriving scene indeed , bombay 's gay scene is thriving by any standards .
there are regular gay parties in bars and pubs .
voodoos , a night club in south mumbai , has a gay night every saturday .
there are other clubs like it in cities such as delhi and bangalore .
but in tradition-bound india , where homosexuality is either ignored , covered up , or treated as a disease , the openness of the bombay gay night is unusual .
gay bombay organises a gay party every month .
it is considered an advertisement for the gay community 's growing boldness .
the last one , on friday , was attended by more than 350 people , roughly a third more than expected .
" we are just a bunch of ordinary guys having a night out , " said the party 's organiser .
slice of normality middle class gay men danced with people from various social backgrounds .
several european tourists also joined in the fun .
an israeli from tel aviv said it was his third time at a bombay gay night .
" it 's better than the bars of tel aviv , " he said .
it was the slice of normality that indian gay couples crave .
and in a rare attempt to break the taboo of invisibility , many gay men at the party agreed to be photographed .
the party 's organisers had initially refused to allow photography .
courage to come out bombay 's monthly gay night comes just eight years after the city played host to india 's first gay conference .
now , says r raj rao , indian society needs to grow up and gay men need to have the courage to come out .
rao describes himself as one of less than 100 indian gay men to openly live as he chooses .
" many people are still not willing to come out of the closet , " he says .
" the number of openly declared gays may not be more than 100 . "
but he says it is a good sign that bombay has become the place to go for gay parties and discos .
creating awareness it is when the music stops that indian gays are reminded that they still do not enjoy the freedom to declare their identity .
" all we want is the acceptance that we exist and that we are not different from heterosexual people , except for our sexual and emotional attractions to men , " says nitin karani , who contributes articles to a gay website .
gay bombay and hum safar , one of india 's first gay organisations , are working to create an awareness of gay rights through workshops , film screenings and parties .
their websites are used as a community forum to talk openly about their various problems .
mr rao , who believes that bombay has more gays than new york and london put together , says most of them do not come out for the obvious reason that society has not accepted them .
" gays still have a long way to go in india " , he says .

gay men in india are slowly becoming more confident in public the boyfriend deals with love between an openly gay man and a young boy who feels unable to pursue his gay instincts , just like millions of other indian men .
it is an unusual storyline with an unusual theme in a country where homosexuality remains a punishable offence .
a 141-year-old law prohibits " unnatural " sexual acts .
the book is being seen as a symbol of the growing confidence of indian gay men , best exemplified by their public behaviour in the western indian city of bombay -lrb- mumbai -rrb- .
r raj rao , the book 's author , says the gay community wants the law to be repealed , but is still not vocal enough to demand its rights .
" there 's a need to politicise the issues , " he says .
" unless that happens there 's little hope for the gay community . "
here in mumbai i can hold hands with my boyfriend and walk around , which is not possible even on the streets of new york and london mohammad yunus there are no official estimates for india 's gay community , but some gay organisations say it may be as large as 50 million people .
" here in mumbai i can hold hands with my boyfriend and walk around , which is not possible even on the streets of new york and london , " says mohammad yunus , a gay man who lives in mumbai .
he believes one in 10 bombay residents in a city of 15 million is gay .
" what 's changed is that our profile has been raised , " says vikram doctor of gay bombay , an organisation that says it creates safe spaces for gays .
thriving scene indeed , bombay 's gay scene is thriving by any standards .
vikram works for gay bombay , a group that helps create " safe space " for gays there are regular gay parties in bars and pubs .
voodoos , a night club in south mumbai , has a gay night every saturday .
there are other clubs like it in cities such as delhi and bangalore .
but in tradition-bound india , where homosexuality is either ignored , covered up , or treated as a disease , the openness of the bombay gay night is unusual .
gay bombay organises a gay party every month .
it is considered an advertisement for the gay community 's growing boldness .
the last one , on friday , was attended by more than 350 people , roughly a third more than expected .
" we are just a bunch of ordinary guys having a night out , " said the party 's organiser .
slice of normality middle class gay men danced with people from various social backgrounds .
several european tourists also joined in the fun .
an israeli from tel aviv said it was his third time at a bombay gay night .
" it 's better than the bars of tel aviv , " he said .
it was the slice of normality that indian gay couples crave .
and in a rare attempt to break the taboo of invisibility , many gay men at the party agreed to be photographed .
the party 's organisers had initially refused to allow photography .
courage to come out bombay 's monthly gay night comes just eight years after the city played host to india 's first gay conference .
nitin -lsb- right -rsb- say all indian gays want is acceptance now , says r raj rao , indian society needs to grow up and gay men need to have the courage to come out .
rao describes himself as one of less than 100 indian gay men to openly live as he chooses .
" many people are still not willing to come out of the closet , " he says .
" the number of openly declared gays may not be more than 100 . "
but he says it is a good sign that bombay has become the place to go for gay parties and discos .
creating awareness it is when the music stops that indian gays are reminded that they still do not enjoy the freedom to declare their identity .
" all we want is the acceptance that we exist and that we are not different from heterosexual people , except for our sexual and emotional attractions to men , " says nitin karani , who contributes articles to a gay website .
gay bombay and hum safar , one of india 's first gay organisations , are working to create an awareness of gay rights through workshops , film screenings and parties .
their websites are used as a community forum to talk openly about their various problems .
mr rao , who believes that bombay has more gays than new york and london put together , says most of them do not come out for the obvious reason that society has not accepted them .

there are other clubs like it in cities such as delhi and bangalore .
but in tradition-bound india , where homosexuality is either ignored , covered up , or treated as a disease , the openness of the bombay gay night is unusual .
gay bombay organises a gay party every month .
it is considered an advertisement for the gay community 's growing boldness .

the company 's shares slid more than 10 % on the us dow jones index as a result of the announcement , which more than halved its forecast to 25-30 cents a share from 60-80 cents .
the problem , kodak told investors , was that the sars virus had depressed asian tourism to such an extent that its sales in the second quarter of the year had been almost cut in half .
that leaves worldwide sales down about 5 % , excluding the bonus of a weaker dollar , which means sales outside the us are worth more .
old news ?
eastman kodak has had to face troubles from the tourism business before .
in january of this year , it said it would have to get rid of 3 in every 100 staff to make up for a slide in travel , at the same time lowering its financial forecasts for the full year - although it said the ongoing move by consumers to digital cameras , which work without film , was also an issue .
indeed , the tourism tribulations are only the tip of the iceberg for kodak , analysts said .
" for kodak , sars may be a problem , " said henry asher , president of money management company northstar group .
" but the impact of digital photography is much more significant than a virus . "

the company 's shares slid more than 10 % on the us dow jones index as a result of the announcement , which more than halved its forecast to 25-30 cents a share from 60-80 cents .
the problem , kodak told investors , was that the sars virus had depressed asian tourism to such an extent that its sales in the second quarter of the year had been almost cut in half .
that leaves worldwide sales down about 5 % , excluding the bonus of a weaker dollar , which means sales outside the us are worth more .
old news ?
eastman kodak has had to face troubles from the tourism business before .
in january of this year , it said it would have to get rid of 3 in every 100 staff to make up for a slide in travel , at the same time lowering its financial forecasts for the full year - although it said the ongoing move by consumers to digital cameras , which work without film , was also an issue .
indeed , the tourism tribulations are only the tip of the iceberg for kodak , analysts said .
" for kodak , sars may be a problem , " said henry asher , president of money management company northstar group .
" but the impact of digital photography is much more significant than a virus . "
