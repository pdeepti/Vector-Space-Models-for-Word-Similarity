a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .

study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .
none of these circumstances are present in this case . - mark w. atwood , usa it seems to me that armin meiwes did his homework , via the internet , to see if he could kill and eat someone and get away with as little punishment as possible .
the whole thing looks calculated with a mastery that says he could have done this before or will do it again .
" pre-meditated brutal , obscene , murderous desire with desire carried out " is what he should be charged with .
the willingness of the victim in this instance is irrelevant because that puts blame of what meiwes did onto someone else . - kathy noda my personal opinion is that there was no wrong doing . the victim was willing . even when he was in the slaughter room he still agreed and he had time to change his mind after he was dismembered . i am not saying i agree with what happened but if you think about it , it is like killing a pig , cow , or any animal . the difference is that the animals do not have a say . now if there is such a concern about this situation why are they not trying to stop the website ? but i think if you are willing , then who is to say it is wrong . what they did is what they wanted to do . - sabrina brooks i think mr. meiwes should be given death penalty or life in prison for this barbaric , heinous crime . - mohamad m. haque , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”
kahlenborn added that there is also the danger that the importing of used machinery and equipment into a country can damage the developing home-based market for industry hardware . despite these factors , the resale trade is booming .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .

munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung also described good business relations with china as schröder ’ s top priority .
it criticized him for brushing aside concerns about beijing ’ s human rights record .
the paper commented that schröder has failed to understand that respect for human rights is a precondition for long-term investment ; and it warned that any country that fails this test remains potentially unstable .
" travel broadens the mind , " declared berlin ’ s tagesspiegel , and added that chancellor schröder has clearly learned a great deal .
" he ’ s discovered what he calls a ‘ new china , ’ and that seems to be reason enough to drop the arms embargo , " the paper sighed sarcastically .
although the majority of chinese have more freedom now than they used to , the paper noted , the rights of certain individuals are still greatly abused .
it cited the persecution of falun gong followers , as well as of the people in tibet and xinjiang .

greater cooperation is good for both sides , it maintained .
china needs the innovation and skills the west can provide , while germany needs hungry new markets to encourage growth .
looking at the proposal to export the unused plutonium factory in hanau , the badische neueste nachrichten from karlsruhe remarked that schröder is not entirely in the wrong .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .

“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”
becker did her part to support the protest action by helping to build a makeshift barricade of scrap wood and old furniture in front of the university ’ s courtyard .

they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .

on his recent trip to china , german chancellor gerhard schröder backed beijing 's " one china " policy .
dw-world asked readers whether germany should stick to this position . schröder is wrong to support the " one china " policy and to compare it to germany .
germany was forcibly ripped apart .
the chinese split by choice .
the german people wanted unification .
the people of taiwan do n't , so nobody should have the right to force it on them .
if they want independence then we should accept and respect their wishes and recognize them as independent .
if germany can not support an " one democratic china " policy , it should stop supporting the chinese communist 's “ one china ” policy over taiwan . - robert chen , usa the national party in taiwan still wanting independence is like the u.s. southern confederacy still demanding independence ! - richard a. giantomas , usa since " germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , " can china count on german military assistance for the chinese invasion of taiwan , following the referendum on independence ?
it would seem only natural given the taiwanese affront to world order . - mike huggins , usa yes , there is one china - a red china , which abuses human rights .
a peace-loving and democratic taiwan has had nothing related with it at all for the past 56 years and this will remain the same in the future . - mark chang , taiwanese citizen residing in the u.s. there is no doubt mr. schröder made the right choice , which is supporting the " one china ” policy .
taiwan is a part of china .
germany is a very popular nation for most of chinese students .
we like that germans never give up and always managed to stand up .
for this reason , they might have special eyes to make the right decision . - zhang gungyi , britain it 's a good time in history for beijing to unite its country .
everyone should support them .

russia is waiting for eu countries and japan to show more interest in buying so-called emission rights before ratifying the kyoto protocol .
russia ’ s support is crucial to activate the carbon gas emission control treaty . first they said “ no , ” then they said “ maybe , ” then came another “ no . ”
russian leaders have so far failed to reach a decision on whether to put ratification of the kyoto protocol before parliament for a vote .
on tuesday , russian president vladimir putin ’ s economic advisor , andrei illarionov , said it wouldn ’ t happen because of negative effects the ratification would have on russia ’ s economic growth . a day later , putin ’ s deputy minister for economic development changed gears .
“ russia will ratify the protocol if it proves to be in our interest , ” said mukhamed tsikhanov , whose ministry is responsible for environment issues . on thursday , illarionov countered with what he called a definitive “ no . ”
he said he was speaking for putin when he rejected the treaty in light of this week ’ s conference on climate in milan .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”
kahlenborn added that there is also the danger that the importing of used machinery and equipment into a country can damage the developing home-based market for industry hardware . despite these factors , the resale trade is booming .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .

munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung also described good business relations with china as schröder ’ s top priority .
it criticized him for brushing aside concerns about beijing ’ s human rights record .
the paper commented that schröder has failed to understand that respect for human rights is a precondition for long-term investment ; and it warned that any country that fails this test remains potentially unstable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.12.2003 creating happiness in a world of plastic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys love playmobil , but the company wants girls to fall in love with its new products .
they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .

more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .

if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .

they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .
in all the others i sit on the floor , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”
becker did her part to support the protest action by helping to build a makeshift barricade of scrap wood and old furniture in front of the university ’ s courtyard .
the main building is plastered with banners and posters . there have also been the traditional protest marches , drawing as many as 20,000 students . unconventional , but effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests were stopped at berlin 's city hall on wednesday .
among the more unusual stunts was the storming of berlin ’ s city hall earlier in the week . students occupied the building for two hours until they were threatened with arrest . last week , students occupied the headquarters of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the junior coalition partner in the city-state 's government - in a similar action . in a more creative vein , a small group of students pitched their tents outside the scandinavian embassies , claiming educational asylum . and in a tent in front of the high-rise office towers at potsdamer platz , university students and professors held a 72-hour physics lecture open to anyone who cared to listen .
“ when i lectured on laser optics at 3 a.m. , all seats were taken with dozens of students listening from outside even though it was freezing , ” said professor paul fumagalli from berlin ’ s free university . the lecture was held both to protest budget cuts and beat the world record of 51 hours 44 minutes for the longest round-the-clock lecture set by 24-year old american dustin buehler earlier this year . berlin sociologist dieter rucht thinks these innovative forms of protest are new and effective .
past student strikes were often aimed at bringing university life to a standstill .
“ that left the public cold , ” rucht said . the 2003 strike , in contrast , is being played out in public spaces , and is challenging the stereotype of the lazy student . the creative protests might be swaying a sympathetic public , but so far , the berlin senate is unmoved . the students aren ’ t giving up , though , with more demonstrations in the works for the weeks to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report blames school failures for dampening german economy the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.12.2003 german press review : " german weapons for the red mandarins " german newspapers commented on chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s visit to china and his controversial calls for lifting a weapons embargo and offering to sell a plutonium plant . in berlin , the conservative-oriented die welt spared no amount of sarcasm in praising schröder ’ s sudden outpouring of generosity .
" german weapons for the red mandarins ?
certainly , after all , the embargo is costing us jobs , " the paper waxed .
" german plutonium technology to the middle kingdom ?
why not – the red-green anti-nuclear consensus is just domestic folklore anyway .
one china with taiwan under the flag of the red dragon ?
go right ahead , " the editorial sneered .
the signals coming back from schröder ’ s sales tour of china are unmistakable , " the paper concluded : " you can make my life a misery at home by moaning about economic crisis and social reforms - but just let me off the hook and see me sweep aside all moral and political export barriers . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung also described good business relations with china as schröder ’ s top priority .
it criticized him for brushing aside concerns about beijing ’ s human rights record .
the paper commented that schröder has failed to understand that respect for human rights is a precondition for long-term investment ; and it warned that any country that fails this test remains potentially unstable .
" travel broadens the mind , " declared berlin ’ s tagesspiegel , and added that chancellor schröder has clearly learned a great deal .
" he ’ s discovered what he calls a ‘ new china , ’ and that seems to be reason enough to drop the arms embargo , " the paper sighed sarcastically .
although the majority of chinese have more freedom now than they used to , the paper noted , the rights of certain individuals are still greatly abused .
it cited the persecution of falun gong followers , as well as of the people in tibet and xinjiang .
if the chancellor pushes human rights issues and china ’ s threatening behavior towards taiwan onto the sidelines , both he and his china policy will lose all credibility , the paper warned .
but some of the smaller papers ventured to offer the chancellor some muted support .
dodging the deeper moral issues , the nordbayerischer kurier from bayreuth said that schröder ’ s decision to visit china every year was a clever one .
greater cooperation is good for both sides , it maintained .
china needs the innovation and skills the west can provide , while germany needs hungry new markets to encourage growth .
looking at the proposal to export the unused plutonium factory in hanau , the badische neueste nachrichten from karlsruhe remarked that schröder is not entirely in the wrong .

the eastern german märkische oderzeitung agreed .
it argued that those in favor of nuclear energy will be annoyed that the technology will only be used abroad , while green politicians will be annoyed at the moral loophole in the german decision to opt out of nuclear power altogether .

russia is waiting for eu countries and japan to show more interest in buying so-called emission rights before ratifying the kyoto protocol .
russia ’ s support is crucial to activate the carbon gas emission control treaty . first they said “ no , ” then they said “ maybe , ” then came another “ no . ”
russian leaders have so far failed to reach a decision on whether to put ratification of the kyoto protocol before parliament for a vote .
on tuesday , russian president vladimir putin ’ s economic advisor , andrei illarionov , said it wouldn ’ t happen because of negative effects the ratification would have on russia ’ s economic growth . a day later , putin ’ s deputy minister for economic development changed gears .
“ russia will ratify the protocol if it proves to be in our interest , ” said mukhamed tsikhanov , whose ministry is responsible for environment issues . on thursday , illarionov countered with what he called a definitive “ no . ”
he said he was speaking for putin when he rejected the treaty in light of this week ’ s conference on climate in milan .
illarionov said tsikhanov was mistaken in his earlier comments . “ the statement was made physically by me , but the words i was using were those of the russian president , ” the economic advisor told reporters .
in september , putin had shocked kyoto supporters by saying his government was still weighing the treaty ’ s pros and cons for russia ’ s economy . russian “ no ” likely to kill kyoto protocol should putin have made up his mind in opposing the treaty , it would almost certainly signify the demise of the six-year old document .
the kyoto protocol calls for a five percent reduction in carbon gas emissions by 2012 , a goal many environmental experts say is already outdated and ineffective in countering global warming . while 119 nations , including eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china , have ratified the protocol , the treaty needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of global carbon gas emissions to become effective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- join u.s. president george w. bush in opposing the kyoto protocol ?
so far , ratifying countries only account for 44 percent of emissions , making russia ’ s 17 percent crucial to activate the protocol .
the u.s. , which accounts for a third of global emissions , is steadfast in its refusal to ratify the document . emission rights as decisive factor ? while opposing the protocol , washington has pushed for allowing trading in “ emission rights . ”
under this scheme , countries with fewer emissions would sell their allowance to others . at least until wednesday , russia seemed to see too little interest from eu countries and japan in this “ carbon market , ” potentially worth billions of dollars .
tsikhanov said russia would make its decision dependent on an increased interest from others to buy its emission rights . “ the countries that have increased their emissions haven ’ t shown any interest in buying rights so far , ” he said . final decision unlikely before russian elections some believe a final decision by russia is unlikely to come in the near future , probably not until after parliamentary elections on sunday and putin ’ s own election next spring . until a definitive answer comes , the future of kyoto remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks experts from 180 countries are meeting in milan for a new round of u.n. climate talks .

on his recent trip to china , german chancellor gerhard schröder backed beijing 's " one china " policy .
dw-world asked readers whether germany should stick to this position . schröder is wrong to support the " one china " policy and to compare it to germany .
germany was forcibly ripped apart .
the chinese split by choice .
the german people wanted unification .
the people of taiwan do n't , so nobody should have the right to force it on them .
if they want independence then we should accept and respect their wishes and recognize them as independent .
if germany can not support an " one democratic china " policy , it should stop supporting the chinese communist 's “ one china ” policy over taiwan . - robert chen , usa the national party in taiwan still wanting independence is like the u.s. southern confederacy still demanding independence ! - richard a. giantomas , usa since " germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , " can china count on german military assistance for the chinese invasion of taiwan , following the referendum on independence ?
it would seem only natural given the taiwanese affront to world order . - mike huggins , usa yes , there is one china - a red china , which abuses human rights .
a peace-loving and democratic taiwan has had nothing related with it at all for the past 56 years and this will remain the same in the future . - mark chang , taiwanese citizen residing in the u.s. there is no doubt mr. schröder made the right choice , which is supporting the " one china ” policy .
taiwan is a part of china .
germany is a very popular nation for most of chinese students .
we like that germans never give up and always managed to stand up .
for this reason , they might have special eyes to make the right decision . - zhang gungyi , britain it 's a good time in history for beijing to unite its country .
everyone should support them .
everyone wo n't . - robert maxwell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder backs " one china " policy saying that germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , chancellor gerhard schröder sided with beijing as china threatened to invade taiwan in case of a referendum on independence .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .

bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .

it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .

professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .

many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .

they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .

they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .
in all the others i sit on the floor , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”
becker did her part to support the protest action by helping to build a makeshift barricade of scrap wood and old furniture in front of the university ’ s courtyard .
the main building is plastered with banners and posters . there have also been the traditional protest marches , drawing as many as 20,000 students . unconventional , but effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests were stopped at berlin 's city hall on wednesday .

“ when i lectured on laser optics at 3 a.m. , all seats were taken with dozens of students listening from outside even though it was freezing , ” said professor paul fumagalli from berlin ’ s free university . the lecture was held both to protest budget cuts and beat the world record of 51 hours 44 minutes for the longest round-the-clock lecture set by 24-year old american dustin buehler earlier this year . berlin sociologist dieter rucht thinks these innovative forms of protest are new and effective .
past student strikes were often aimed at bringing university life to a standstill .
“ that left the public cold , ” rucht said . the 2003 strike , in contrast , is being played out in public spaces , and is challenging the stereotype of the lazy student . the creative protests might be swaying a sympathetic public , but so far , the berlin senate is unmoved . the students aren ’ t giving up , though , with more demonstrations in the works for the weeks to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report blames school failures for dampening german economy the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .

russia is waiting for eu countries and japan to show more interest in buying so-called emission rights before ratifying the kyoto protocol .
russia ’ s support is crucial to activate the carbon gas emission control treaty . first they said “ no , ” then they said “ maybe , ” then came another “ no . ”
russian leaders have so far failed to reach a decision on whether to put ratification of the kyoto protocol before parliament for a vote .
on tuesday , russian president vladimir putin ’ s economic advisor , andrei illarionov , said it wouldn ’ t happen because of negative effects the ratification would have on russia ’ s economic growth . a day later , putin ’ s deputy minister for economic development changed gears .
“ russia will ratify the protocol if it proves to be in our interest , ” said mukhamed tsikhanov , whose ministry is responsible for environment issues . on thursday , illarionov countered with what he called a definitive “ no . ”
he said he was speaking for putin when he rejected the treaty in light of this week ’ s conference on climate in milan .
illarionov said tsikhanov was mistaken in his earlier comments . “ the statement was made physically by me , but the words i was using were those of the russian president , ” the economic advisor told reporters .
in september , putin had shocked kyoto supporters by saying his government was still weighing the treaty ’ s pros and cons for russia ’ s economy . russian “ no ” likely to kill kyoto protocol should putin have made up his mind in opposing the treaty , it would almost certainly signify the demise of the six-year old document .
the kyoto protocol calls for a five percent reduction in carbon gas emissions by 2012 , a goal many environmental experts say is already outdated and ineffective in countering global warming . while 119 nations , including eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china , have ratified the protocol , the treaty needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of global carbon gas emissions to become effective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- join u.s. president george w. bush in opposing the kyoto protocol ?
so far , ratifying countries only account for 44 percent of emissions , making russia ’ s 17 percent crucial to activate the protocol .
the u.s. , which accounts for a third of global emissions , is steadfast in its refusal to ratify the document . emission rights as decisive factor ? while opposing the protocol , washington has pushed for allowing trading in “ emission rights . ”
under this scheme , countries with fewer emissions would sell their allowance to others . at least until wednesday , russia seemed to see too little interest from eu countries and japan in this “ carbon market , ” potentially worth billions of dollars .
tsikhanov said russia would make its decision dependent on an increased interest from others to buy its emission rights . “ the countries that have increased their emissions haven ’ t shown any interest in buying rights so far , ” he said . final decision unlikely before russian elections some believe a final decision by russia is unlikely to come in the near future , probably not until after parliamentary elections on sunday and putin ’ s own election next spring . until a definitive answer comes , the future of kyoto remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks experts from 180 countries are meeting in milan for a new round of u.n. climate talks .

they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 04.12.2003 cannibal trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man-eater 's teeth the german trial of a man who killed and ate another man with the latter 's permission has lawyers debating about the appropriate sentence .
dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .

the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .

these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”
kahlenborn added that there is also the danger that the importing of used machinery and equipment into a country can damage the developing home-based market for industry hardware . despite these factors , the resale trade is booming .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”
kahlenborn added that there is also the danger that the importing of used machinery and equipment into a country can damage the developing home-based market for industry hardware . despite these factors , the resale trade is booming .

while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”
kahlenborn added that there is also the danger that the importing of used machinery and equipment into a country can damage the developing home-based market for industry hardware . despite these factors , the resale trade is booming .

dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .
none of these circumstances are present in this case . - mark w. atwood , usa it seems to me that armin meiwes did his homework , via the internet , to see if he could kill and eat someone and get away with as little punishment as possible .
the whole thing looks calculated with a mastery that says he could have done this before or will do it again .
" pre-meditated brutal , obscene , murderous desire with desire carried out " is what he should be charged with .
the willingness of the victim in this instance is irrelevant because that puts blame of what meiwes did onto someone else . - kathy noda my personal opinion is that there was no wrong doing . the victim was willing . even when he was in the slaughter room he still agreed and he had time to change his mind after he was dismembered . i am not saying i agree with what happened but if you think about it , it is like killing a pig , cow , or any animal . the difference is that the animals do not have a say . now if there is such a concern about this situation why are they not trying to stop the website ? but i think if you are willing , then who is to say it is wrong . what they did is what they wanted to do . - sabrina brooks i think mr. meiwes should be given death penalty or life in prison for this barbaric , heinous crime . - mohamad m. haque , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

russia is waiting for eu countries and japan to show more interest in buying so-called emission rights before ratifying the kyoto protocol .
russia ’ s support is crucial to activate the carbon gas emission control treaty . first they said “ no , ” then they said “ maybe , ” then came another “ no . ”
russian leaders have so far failed to reach a decision on whether to put ratification of the kyoto protocol before parliament for a vote .
on tuesday , russian president vladimir putin ’ s economic advisor , andrei illarionov , said it wouldn ’ t happen because of negative effects the ratification would have on russia ’ s economic growth . a day later , putin ’ s deputy minister for economic development changed gears .
“ russia will ratify the protocol if it proves to be in our interest , ” said mukhamed tsikhanov , whose ministry is responsible for environment issues . on thursday , illarionov countered with what he called a definitive “ no . ”
he said he was speaking for putin when he rejected the treaty in light of this week ’ s conference on climate in milan .
illarionov said tsikhanov was mistaken in his earlier comments . “ the statement was made physically by me , but the words i was using were those of the russian president , ” the economic advisor told reporters .
in september , putin had shocked kyoto supporters by saying his government was still weighing the treaty ’ s pros and cons for russia ’ s economy . russian “ no ” likely to kill kyoto protocol should putin have made up his mind in opposing the treaty , it would almost certainly signify the demise of the six-year old document .
the kyoto protocol calls for a five percent reduction in carbon gas emissions by 2012 , a goal many environmental experts say is already outdated and ineffective in countering global warming . while 119 nations , including eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china , have ratified the protocol , the treaty needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of global carbon gas emissions to become effective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- join u.s. president george w. bush in opposing the kyoto protocol ?
so far , ratifying countries only account for 44 percent of emissions , making russia ’ s 17 percent crucial to activate the protocol .
the u.s. , which accounts for a third of global emissions , is steadfast in its refusal to ratify the document . emission rights as decisive factor ? while opposing the protocol , washington has pushed for allowing trading in “ emission rights . ”
under this scheme , countries with fewer emissions would sell their allowance to others . at least until wednesday , russia seemed to see too little interest from eu countries and japan in this “ carbon market , ” potentially worth billions of dollars .
tsikhanov said russia would make its decision dependent on an increased interest from others to buy its emission rights . “ the countries that have increased their emissions haven ’ t shown any interest in buying rights so far , ” he said . final decision unlikely before russian elections some believe a final decision by russia is unlikely to come in the near future , probably not until after parliamentary elections on sunday and putin ’ s own election next spring . until a definitive answer comes , the future of kyoto remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks experts from 180 countries are meeting in milan for a new round of u.n. climate talks .

tsikhanov said russia would make its decision dependent on an increased interest from others to buy its emission rights . “ the countries that have increased their emissions haven ’ t shown any interest in buying rights so far , ” he said . final decision unlikely before russian elections some believe a final decision by russia is unlikely to come in the near future , probably not until after parliamentary elections on sunday and putin ’ s own election next spring . until a definitive answer comes , the future of kyoto remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks experts from 180 countries are meeting in milan for a new round of u.n. climate talks .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .

“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .
in all the others i sit on the floor , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”

they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .

a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .

more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .

a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”

on his recent trip to china , german chancellor gerhard schröder backed beijing 's " one china " policy .

germany was forcibly ripped apart .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .
in all the others i sit on the floor , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”
becker did her part to support the protest action by helping to build a makeshift barricade of scrap wood and old furniture in front of the university ’ s courtyard .
the main building is plastered with banners and posters . there have also been the traditional protest marches , drawing as many as 20,000 students . unconventional , but effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests were stopped at berlin 's city hall on wednesday .
among the more unusual stunts was the storming of berlin ’ s city hall earlier in the week . students occupied the building for two hours until they were threatened with arrest . last week , students occupied the headquarters of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the junior coalition partner in the city-state 's government - in a similar action . in a more creative vein , a small group of students pitched their tents outside the scandinavian embassies , claiming educational asylum . and in a tent in front of the high-rise office towers at potsdamer platz , university students and professors held a 72-hour physics lecture open to anyone who cared to listen .
“ when i lectured on laser optics at 3 a.m. , all seats were taken with dozens of students listening from outside even though it was freezing , ” said professor paul fumagalli from berlin ’ s free university . the lecture was held both to protest budget cuts and beat the world record of 51 hours 44 minutes for the longest round-the-clock lecture set by 24-year old american dustin buehler earlier this year . berlin sociologist dieter rucht thinks these innovative forms of protest are new and effective .
past student strikes were often aimed at bringing university life to a standstill .
“ that left the public cold , ” rucht said . the 2003 strike , in contrast , is being played out in public spaces , and is challenging the stereotype of the lazy student . the creative protests might be swaying a sympathetic public , but so far , the berlin senate is unmoved . the students aren ’ t giving up , though , with more demonstrations in the works for the weeks to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report blames school failures for dampening german economy the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”
kahlenborn added that there is also the danger that the importing of used machinery and equipment into a country can damage the developing home-based market for industry hardware . despite these factors , the resale trade is booming .

turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .

they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .
the company expects its two million annual visitors will jumpstart the local economy .

dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .
none of these circumstances are present in this case . - mark w. atwood , usa it seems to me that armin meiwes did his homework , via the internet , to see if he could kill and eat someone and get away with as little punishment as possible .
the whole thing looks calculated with a mastery that says he could have done this before or will do it again .
" pre-meditated brutal , obscene , murderous desire with desire carried out " is what he should be charged with .
the willingness of the victim in this instance is irrelevant because that puts blame of what meiwes did onto someone else . - kathy noda my personal opinion is that there was no wrong doing . the victim was willing . even when he was in the slaughter room he still agreed and he had time to change his mind after he was dismembered . i am not saying i agree with what happened but if you think about it , it is like killing a pig , cow , or any animal . the difference is that the animals do not have a say . now if there is such a concern about this situation why are they not trying to stop the website ? but i think if you are willing , then who is to say it is wrong . what they did is what they wanted to do . - sabrina brooks i think mr. meiwes should be given death penalty or life in prison for this barbaric , heinous crime . - mohamad m. haque , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history .

russia is waiting for eu countries and japan to show more interest in buying so-called emission rights before ratifying the kyoto protocol .
russia ’ s support is crucial to activate the carbon gas emission control treaty . first they said “ no , ” then they said “ maybe , ” then came another “ no . ”
russian leaders have so far failed to reach a decision on whether to put ratification of the kyoto protocol before parliament for a vote .
on tuesday , russian president vladimir putin ’ s economic advisor , andrei illarionov , said it wouldn ’ t happen because of negative effects the ratification would have on russia ’ s economic growth . a day later , putin ’ s deputy minister for economic development changed gears .
“ russia will ratify the protocol if it proves to be in our interest , ” said mukhamed tsikhanov , whose ministry is responsible for environment issues . on thursday , illarionov countered with what he called a definitive “ no . ”
he said he was speaking for putin when he rejected the treaty in light of this week ’ s conference on climate in milan .
illarionov said tsikhanov was mistaken in his earlier comments . “ the statement was made physically by me , but the words i was using were those of the russian president , ” the economic advisor told reporters .
in september , putin had shocked kyoto supporters by saying his government was still weighing the treaty ’ s pros and cons for russia ’ s economy . russian “ no ” likely to kill kyoto protocol should putin have made up his mind in opposing the treaty , it would almost certainly signify the demise of the six-year old document .
the kyoto protocol calls for a five percent reduction in carbon gas emissions by 2012 , a goal many environmental experts say is already outdated and ineffective in countering global warming . while 119 nations , including eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china , have ratified the protocol , the treaty needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of global carbon gas emissions to become effective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- join u.s. president george w. bush in opposing the kyoto protocol ?
so far , ratifying countries only account for 44 percent of emissions , making russia ’ s 17 percent crucial to activate the protocol .
the u.s. , which accounts for a third of global emissions , is steadfast in its refusal to ratify the document . emission rights as decisive factor ? while opposing the protocol , washington has pushed for allowing trading in “ emission rights . ”
under this scheme , countries with fewer emissions would sell their allowance to others . at least until wednesday , russia seemed to see too little interest from eu countries and japan in this “ carbon market , ” potentially worth billions of dollars .
tsikhanov said russia would make its decision dependent on an increased interest from others to buy its emission rights . “ the countries that have increased their emissions haven ’ t shown any interest in buying rights so far , ” he said . final decision unlikely before russian elections some believe a final decision by russia is unlikely to come in the near future , probably not until after parliamentary elections on sunday and putin ’ s own election next spring . until a definitive answer comes , the future of kyoto remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks experts from 180 countries are meeting in milan for a new round of u.n. climate talks .

dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .
none of these circumstances are present in this case . - mark w. atwood , usa it seems to me that armin meiwes did his homework , via the internet , to see if he could kill and eat someone and get away with as little punishment as possible .
the whole thing looks calculated with a mastery that says he could have done this before or will do it again .
" pre-meditated brutal , obscene , murderous desire with desire carried out " is what he should be charged with .
the willingness of the victim in this instance is irrelevant because that puts blame of what meiwes did onto someone else . - kathy noda my personal opinion is that there was no wrong doing . the victim was willing . even when he was in the slaughter room he still agreed and he had time to change his mind after he was dismembered . i am not saying i agree with what happened but if you think about it , it is like killing a pig , cow , or any animal . the difference is that the animals do not have a say . now if there is such a concern about this situation why are they not trying to stop the website ? but i think if you are willing , then who is to say it is wrong . what they did is what they wanted to do . - sabrina brooks i think mr. meiwes should be given death penalty or life in prison for this barbaric , heinous crime . - mohamad m. haque , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history .

dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .
none of these circumstances are present in this case . - mark w. atwood , usa it seems to me that armin meiwes did his homework , via the internet , to see if he could kill and eat someone and get away with as little punishment as possible .
the whole thing looks calculated with a mastery that says he could have done this before or will do it again .
" pre-meditated brutal , obscene , murderous desire with desire carried out " is what he should be charged with .
the willingness of the victim in this instance is irrelevant because that puts blame of what meiwes did onto someone else . - kathy noda my personal opinion is that there was no wrong doing . the victim was willing . even when he was in the slaughter room he still agreed and he had time to change his mind after he was dismembered . i am not saying i agree with what happened but if you think about it , it is like killing a pig , cow , or any animal . the difference is that the animals do not have a say . now if there is such a concern about this situation why are they not trying to stop the website ? but i think if you are willing , then who is to say it is wrong . what they did is what they wanted to do . - sabrina brooks i think mr. meiwes should be given death penalty or life in prison for this barbaric , heinous crime . - mohamad m. haque , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history .

" german weapons for the red mandarins ?
certainly , after all , the embargo is costing us jobs , " the paper waxed .
" german plutonium technology to the middle kingdom ?
why not – the red-green anti-nuclear consensus is just domestic folklore anyway .
one china with taiwan under the flag of the red dragon ?
go right ahead , " the editorial sneered .
the signals coming back from schröder ’ s sales tour of china are unmistakable , " the paper concluded : " you can make my life a misery at home by moaning about economic crisis and social reforms - but just let me off the hook and see me sweep aside all moral and political export barriers . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung also described good business relations with china as schröder ’ s top priority .
it criticized him for brushing aside concerns about beijing ’ s human rights record .
the paper commented that schröder has failed to understand that respect for human rights is a precondition for long-term investment ; and it warned that any country that fails this test remains potentially unstable .
" travel broadens the mind , " declared berlin ’ s tagesspiegel , and added that chancellor schröder has clearly learned a great deal .
" he ’ s discovered what he calls a ‘ new china , ’ and that seems to be reason enough to drop the arms embargo , " the paper sighed sarcastically .
although the majority of chinese have more freedom now than they used to , the paper noted , the rights of certain individuals are still greatly abused .
it cited the persecution of falun gong followers , as well as of the people in tibet and xinjiang .
if the chancellor pushes human rights issues and china ’ s threatening behavior towards taiwan onto the sidelines , both he and his china policy will lose all credibility , the paper warned .
but some of the smaller papers ventured to offer the chancellor some muted support .
dodging the deeper moral issues , the nordbayerischer kurier from bayreuth said that schröder ’ s decision to visit china every year was a clever one .
greater cooperation is good for both sides , it maintained .
china needs the innovation and skills the west can provide , while germany needs hungry new markets to encourage growth .
looking at the proposal to export the unused plutonium factory in hanau , the badische neueste nachrichten from karlsruhe remarked that schröder is not entirely in the wrong .
since the controversial plant is not an arms project in the conventional sense , it will hardly be possible to prevent it from being sold to china , the paper explained .
the eastern german märkische oderzeitung agreed .
it argued that those in favor of nuclear energy will be annoyed that the technology will only be used abroad , while green politicians will be annoyed at the moral loophole in the german decision to opt out of nuclear power altogether .
but as far as doubts about its usage are concerned , the paper noted that beijing is already officially recognized as a nuclear power , and doesn ’ t need german help to obtain weapons-grade plutonium . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.12.2003 creating happiness in a world of plastic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boys love playmobil , but the company wants girls to fall in love with its new products .
they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .

the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .

russia is waiting for eu countries and japan to show more interest in buying so-called emission rights before ratifying the kyoto protocol .
russia ’ s support is crucial to activate the carbon gas emission control treaty . first they said “ no , ” then they said “ maybe , ” then came another “ no . ”
russian leaders have so far failed to reach a decision on whether to put ratification of the kyoto protocol before parliament for a vote .
on tuesday , russian president vladimir putin ’ s economic advisor , andrei illarionov , said it wouldn ’ t happen because of negative effects the ratification would have on russia ’ s economic growth . a day later , putin ’ s deputy minister for economic development changed gears .
“ russia will ratify the protocol if it proves to be in our interest , ” said mukhamed tsikhanov , whose ministry is responsible for environment issues . on thursday , illarionov countered with what he called a definitive “ no . ”
he said he was speaking for putin when he rejected the treaty in light of this week ’ s conference on climate in milan .
illarionov said tsikhanov was mistaken in his earlier comments . “ the statement was made physically by me , but the words i was using were those of the russian president , ” the economic advisor told reporters .
in september , putin had shocked kyoto supporters by saying his government was still weighing the treaty ’ s pros and cons for russia ’ s economy . russian “ no ” likely to kill kyoto protocol should putin have made up his mind in opposing the treaty , it would almost certainly signify the demise of the six-year old document .
the kyoto protocol calls for a five percent reduction in carbon gas emissions by 2012 , a goal many environmental experts say is already outdated and ineffective in countering global warming . while 119 nations , including eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china , have ratified the protocol , the treaty needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of global carbon gas emissions to become effective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- join u.s. president george w. bush in opposing the kyoto protocol ?
so far , ratifying countries only account for 44 percent of emissions , making russia ’ s 17 percent crucial to activate the protocol .
the u.s. , which accounts for a third of global emissions , is steadfast in its refusal to ratify the document . emission rights as decisive factor ? while opposing the protocol , washington has pushed for allowing trading in “ emission rights . ”
under this scheme , countries with fewer emissions would sell their allowance to others . at least until wednesday , russia seemed to see too little interest from eu countries and japan in this “ carbon market , ” potentially worth billions of dollars .
tsikhanov said russia would make its decision dependent on an increased interest from others to buy its emission rights . “ the countries that have increased their emissions haven ’ t shown any interest in buying rights so far , ” he said . final decision unlikely before russian elections some believe a final decision by russia is unlikely to come in the near future , probably not until after parliamentary elections on sunday and putin ’ s own election next spring . until a definitive answer comes , the future of kyoto remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks experts from 180 countries are meeting in milan for a new round of u.n. climate talks .

russia is waiting for eu countries and japan to show more interest in buying so-called emission rights before ratifying the kyoto protocol .
russia ’ s support is crucial to activate the carbon gas emission control treaty . first they said “ no , ” then they said “ maybe , ” then came another “ no . ”
russian leaders have so far failed to reach a decision on whether to put ratification of the kyoto protocol before parliament for a vote .
on tuesday , russian president vladimir putin ’ s economic advisor , andrei illarionov , said it wouldn ’ t happen because of negative effects the ratification would have on russia ’ s economic growth . a day later , putin ’ s deputy minister for economic development changed gears .
“ russia will ratify the protocol if it proves to be in our interest , ” said mukhamed tsikhanov , whose ministry is responsible for environment issues . on thursday , illarionov countered with what he called a definitive “ no . ”
he said he was speaking for putin when he rejected the treaty in light of this week ’ s conference on climate in milan .
illarionov said tsikhanov was mistaken in his earlier comments . “ the statement was made physically by me , but the words i was using were those of the russian president , ” the economic advisor told reporters .
in september , putin had shocked kyoto supporters by saying his government was still weighing the treaty ’ s pros and cons for russia ’ s economy . russian “ no ” likely to kill kyoto protocol should putin have made up his mind in opposing the treaty , it would almost certainly signify the demise of the six-year old document .

on his recent trip to china , german chancellor gerhard schröder backed beijing 's " one china " policy .
dw-world asked readers whether germany should stick to this position . schröder is wrong to support the " one china " policy and to compare it to germany .
germany was forcibly ripped apart .
the chinese split by choice .
the german people wanted unification .
the people of taiwan do n't , so nobody should have the right to force it on them .
if they want independence then we should accept and respect their wishes and recognize them as independent .
if germany can not support an " one democratic china " policy , it should stop supporting the chinese communist 's “ one china ” policy over taiwan . - robert chen , usa the national party in taiwan still wanting independence is like the u.s. southern confederacy still demanding independence ! - richard a. giantomas , usa since " germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , " can china count on german military assistance for the chinese invasion of taiwan , following the referendum on independence ?
it would seem only natural given the taiwanese affront to world order . - mike huggins , usa yes , there is one china - a red china , which abuses human rights .
a peace-loving and democratic taiwan has had nothing related with it at all for the past 56 years and this will remain the same in the future . - mark chang , taiwanese citizen residing in the u.s. there is no doubt mr. schröder made the right choice , which is supporting the " one china ” policy .
taiwan is a part of china .
germany is a very popular nation for most of chinese students .
we like that germans never give up and always managed to stand up .
for this reason , they might have special eyes to make the right decision . - zhang gungyi , britain it 's a good time in history for beijing to unite its country .
everyone should support them .
everyone wo n't . - robert maxwell send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder backs " one china " policy saying that germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , chancellor gerhard schröder sided with beijing as china threatened to invade taiwan in case of a referendum on independence .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .
in all the others i sit on the floor , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”
becker did her part to support the protest action by helping to build a makeshift barricade of scrap wood and old furniture in front of the university ’ s courtyard .

“ when i lectured on laser optics at 3 a.m. , all seats were taken with dozens of students listening from outside even though it was freezing , ” said professor paul fumagalli from berlin ’ s free university . the lecture was held both to protest budget cuts and beat the world record of 51 hours 44 minutes for the longest round-the-clock lecture set by 24-year old american dustin buehler earlier this year . berlin sociologist dieter rucht thinks these innovative forms of protest are new and effective .
past student strikes were often aimed at bringing university life to a standstill .
“ that left the public cold , ” rucht said . the 2003 strike , in contrast , is being played out in public spaces , and is challenging the stereotype of the lazy student . the creative protests might be swaying a sympathetic public , but so far , the berlin senate is unmoved . the students aren ’ t giving up , though , with more demonstrations in the works for the weeks to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report blames school failures for dampening german economy the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn .

both gül and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan are expected to raise the issue of intelligence sharing at the coming eu summit in brussels .
gül said europe had failed " the solidarity test in the fight against terrorism " and warned european leaders that if their countries were attacked " everyone will think twice before cooperating . "
travel warnings issued by some european countries as well as visa restrictions on turkish nationals wishing to travel to britain have been seen as " western attempts to isolate the country . "

more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .

if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .

in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .

they bring smiles to their owners , big and small , and they smile back .
more than 1.7 billion playmobil figures now populate childrens ’ rooms around the world .
it all began 30 years ago in the midst of an energy crisis . with over 1.7 billion citizens , it would be the biggest country in the world – even bigger than china .
and the happiest .
if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .

they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .
in all the others i sit on the floor , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”
becker did her part to support the protest action by helping to build a makeshift barricade of scrap wood and old furniture in front of the university ’ s courtyard .
the main building is plastered with banners and posters . there have also been the traditional protest marches , drawing as many as 20,000 students . unconventional , but effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests were stopped at berlin 's city hall on wednesday .
among the more unusual stunts was the storming of berlin ’ s city hall earlier in the week . students occupied the building for two hours until they were threatened with arrest . last week , students occupied the headquarters of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the junior coalition partner in the city-state 's government - in a similar action . in a more creative vein , a small group of students pitched their tents outside the scandinavian embassies , claiming educational asylum . and in a tent in front of the high-rise office towers at potsdamer platz , university students and professors held a 72-hour physics lecture open to anyone who cared to listen .
“ when i lectured on laser optics at 3 a.m. , all seats were taken with dozens of students listening from outside even though it was freezing , ” said professor paul fumagalli from berlin ’ s free university . the lecture was held both to protest budget cuts and beat the world record of 51 hours 44 minutes for the longest round-the-clock lecture set by 24-year old american dustin buehler earlier this year . berlin sociologist dieter rucht thinks these innovative forms of protest are new and effective .

russia is waiting for eu countries and japan to show more interest in buying so-called emission rights before ratifying the kyoto protocol .
russia ’ s support is crucial to activate the carbon gas emission control treaty . first they said “ no , ” then they said “ maybe , ” then came another “ no . ”
russian leaders have so far failed to reach a decision on whether to put ratification of the kyoto protocol before parliament for a vote .
on tuesday , russian president vladimir putin ’ s economic advisor , andrei illarionov , said it wouldn ’ t happen because of negative effects the ratification would have on russia ’ s economic growth . a day later , putin ’ s deputy minister for economic development changed gears .
“ russia will ratify the protocol if it proves to be in our interest , ” said mukhamed tsikhanov , whose ministry is responsible for environment issues . on thursday , illarionov countered with what he called a definitive “ no . ”
he said he was speaking for putin when he rejected the treaty in light of this week ’ s conference on climate in milan .
illarionov said tsikhanov was mistaken in his earlier comments . “ the statement was made physically by me , but the words i was using were those of the russian president , ” the economic advisor told reporters .
in september , putin had shocked kyoto supporters by saying his government was still weighing the treaty ’ s pros and cons for russia ’ s economy . russian “ no ” likely to kill kyoto protocol should putin have made up his mind in opposing the treaty , it would almost certainly signify the demise of the six-year old document .
the kyoto protocol calls for a five percent reduction in carbon gas emissions by 2012 , a goal many environmental experts say is already outdated and ineffective in countering global warming . while 119 nations , including eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china , have ratified the protocol , the treaty needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of global carbon gas emissions to become effective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- join u.s. president george w. bush in opposing the kyoto protocol ?
so far , ratifying countries only account for 44 percent of emissions , making russia ’ s 17 percent crucial to activate the protocol .
the u.s. , which accounts for a third of global emissions , is steadfast in its refusal to ratify the document . emission rights as decisive factor ? while opposing the protocol , washington has pushed for allowing trading in “ emission rights . ”
under this scheme , countries with fewer emissions would sell their allowance to others . at least until wednesday , russia seemed to see too little interest from eu countries and japan in this “ carbon market , ” potentially worth billions of dollars .
tsikhanov said russia would make its decision dependent on an increased interest from others to buy its emission rights . “ the countries that have increased their emissions haven ’ t shown any interest in buying rights so far , ” he said . final decision unlikely before russian elections some believe a final decision by russia is unlikely to come in the near future , probably not until after parliamentary elections on sunday and putin ’ s own election next spring . until a definitive answer comes , the future of kyoto remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks experts from 180 countries are meeting in milan for a new round of u.n. climate talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.12.2003 -pipe- 16:00 utc detectives advocate drop out program for islamists german detectives have called for more help for muslim extremists ready to get out of the scene and cooperate with the police .
" criminal investigators lack the necessary tools to break someone out of the circle or surroundings of violent islamists , " klaus jansen , head of the german detective union bdk , told the associated press .
the recent düsseldorf trial , in which a jordanian man was sentenced to four years in jail for his role in helping plan terrorist attacks in germany , had shown that some islamic extremists are willing to cooperate with the police .
the convicted man had received less than half the maximum sentence because of the extensive testimony he had given .
jansen said a policy of leniency should be extended to islamists who are prepared to provide police with useful information , but that it should mainly be offered to supporters and confidants rather than the perpetrators of crimes .
jansen also called for a phone hotline that islamists could use to anonymously pass information on to police .
jansen criticized the fact that interior minister schily has supported a change to leniency policies for chief witnesses but rejects a drop out program .
justice minister zypries has dismissed altering leniency policies . dw-world.de terrorist sentenced to four years a jordanian accused of plotting attacks against jewish institutions was sentended to four years in prison .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "

a study on anti-semitism , allegedly quashed by the eu for singling out muslims and pro-palestinian groups for anti-jewish violence , has now unofficially been published on the net .
allegations of censorship are flying . the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- faced tough questioning from members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- on wednesday after it emerged that the center had shelved an anti-semitism study , conducted by a berlin-based research institute , on account of its sensitive content .
the controversy surfaced after the european jewish congress -lrb- ejc -rrb- , an umbrella organization for europe ’ s jewish organizations and green mep daniel cohn-bendit said on wednesday they had published the study online .
eumc accused of censorship the eumc stands accused of suppressing the results of the february study because it singled out muslim immigrants and pro-palestinians for being behind a rise in anti-semitic violence in europe .
cohn-bendit said it was important the suppressed study saw the light of day .
" even if this report is problematic and controversial , it would be worse not to publish than to make it accessible to the public .
in a democracy , we need transparency and an open debate rather than censorship , " he stressed .
cobi benatoff , chairman of the european jewish congress , also said the issue smacked of censorship .
" it was a political decision .
now the people can read it and decide for themselves , " he told the financial times .
" to be candid -lsb- the eu -rsb- are not prepared to deal with the sensitive subject of anti-semitism among muslims , who constitute europe ’ s largest minority , " elan steinberg , ejc executive vice-president told reuters .
eumc faces the music the eumc has defended its decision not to publish the study .
bob purkiss , chair of the eumc management board , insisted that the study , carried out by the center for research on anti-semitism at berlin ’ s technical university , had been put on hold because it was considered to be " of poor quality and lacking empirical evidence . "
in a press release on wednesday , the eumc said the data it had provided to the authors " was not comparable and sufficient enough . "
the eumc now faces a freeze on its finances following the controversy .
christian democratic union mep armin laschet announced on wednesday that the european parliament had suspended the eumc ’ s funding , amounting to € 200,000 .
" the blending of politics and science " must first be cleared , laschet said and added that " political motives " seemed to be behind the eumc ’ s decision .
study links anti-semitism to middle east conflict the study , called " manifestations of anti-semitism in the european union , " was handed over to the eumc in february this year and examines incidents of anti-semitism until summer 2002 .
it states that anti-semitic violence had clearly risen in all eu member states in spring 2002 .
" this wave of anti-semitism started with the ' al-aqsa intifada ' in october 2000 and was fuelled by the conflict in the middle east and the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on sept .
11 , 2001 , which triggered off a fierce debate on the causes of radical islamic terrorism , " the authors wrote .
professor dr. werner bergmann , one of the authors of the study , told deutsche welle that anti-semitism remains latent most of the time .
" however in times when this topic is on the top of the agenda , as in the first half of 2002 , strong feelings and attitudes were evoked in some countries especially france , the netherlands , belgium and also germany , " he said .
" there were big discussions on the politics of israel , which sometimes use anti-semitic stereotypes and sometimes even become violent . "
the study concludes there was no discernibly consistent pattern in anti-semitic violence for the whole of europe , despite some similarities .
" physical attacks on jews and the desecration and destruction of synagogues were acts often committed by young muslim perpetrators in the monitoring period .
many of these attacks occurred either during or after pro-palestinian demonstrations , " the study states .
the report also says that anti-semitic remarks in the extreme left-wing scene are mainly found in the context of pro-palestinian and anti-globalization rallies .
latent anti-semitism in germany ?
with regard to germany , the study states that most anti-semitic attacks come from an active far-right scene .
however the main problem in germany , the report says , is not an increase in physical acts of violence against jews and their organizations , but rather a more subtle form of anti-semitism manifested in anti-jewish statements and behavior .
dr. bergmann said that the most important finding of the study with respect to germany " is that we have a very strong public discussion about the middle east conflict and a very critical position towards the politics of israel .
the threat by young muslims is rare . "
the authors and researchers who worked on the study are now urging eu nations to intensify cooperation on gathering data on anti-semitic incidents as well as drafting tougher laws against anti-semitic content in the internet . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel slams european anti-semitism israeli prime minister ariel sharon has accused europe of " collective anti-semitism .

dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .
none of these circumstances are present in this case . - mark w. atwood , usa it seems to me that armin meiwes did his homework , via the internet , to see if he could kill and eat someone and get away with as little punishment as possible .
the whole thing looks calculated with a mastery that says he could have done this before or will do it again .
" pre-meditated brutal , obscene , murderous desire with desire carried out " is what he should be charged with .
the willingness of the victim in this instance is irrelevant because that puts blame of what meiwes did onto someone else . - kathy noda my personal opinion is that there was no wrong doing . the victim was willing . even when he was in the slaughter room he still agreed and he had time to change his mind after he was dismembered . i am not saying i agree with what happened but if you think about it , it is like killing a pig , cow , or any animal . the difference is that the animals do not have a say . now if there is such a concern about this situation why are they not trying to stop the website ? but i think if you are willing , then who is to say it is wrong . what they did is what they wanted to do . - sabrina brooks i think mr. meiwes should be given death penalty or life in prison for this barbaric , heinous crime . - mohamad m. haque , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history .

dw-world asked readers for their opinion . i am a lawyer , and though i come from a very different culture and legal system , i am amazed that such a horrific crime could possibly be considered anything less than premeditated murder .
under the common law system , a person can not be considered to consent to his or her own murder .
thus , whether brandes volunteered to be killed and eaten would not be relevant in our system .
even allowing for legal differences , and for a special category for euthanasia , the killing of mr. brandes can not be passed off as a bizarre form of mercy killing .
euthanasia , or physician-assisted suicide , if it is to be sanctioned at all , has to be very strictly confined to particular circumstances where the killing is done in order to terminate extreme physical suffering , there is no hope for a cure , and it can be verified that the patient is giving knowing and fully rational consent .
none of these circumstances are present in this case . - mark w. atwood , usa it seems to me that armin meiwes did his homework , via the internet , to see if he could kill and eat someone and get away with as little punishment as possible .
the whole thing looks calculated with a mastery that says he could have done this before or will do it again .
" pre-meditated brutal , obscene , murderous desire with desire carried out " is what he should be charged with .
the willingness of the victim in this instance is irrelevant because that puts blame of what meiwes did onto someone else . - kathy noda my personal opinion is that there was no wrong doing . the victim was willing . even when he was in the slaughter room he still agreed and he had time to change his mind after he was dismembered . i am not saying i agree with what happened but if you think about it , it is like killing a pig , cow , or any animal . the difference is that the animals do not have a say . now if there is such a concern about this situation why are they not trying to stop the website ? but i think if you are willing , then who is to say it is wrong . what they did is what they wanted to do . - sabrina brooks i think mr. meiwes should be given death penalty or life in prison for this barbaric , heinous crime . - mohamad m. haque , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history .

the commission imposed the fine on volkswagen for the alleged fixing of prices on its popular passat sedans .
the european union ’ s court of first instance in luxembourg criticized the commission for failing to prove " any actual acquiescence by the dealers . "
the court said there was no evidence to prove a " concurrence of wills " between dealers and company .
a commission spokesperson admitted defeat calling the decision " very regrettable " .
the commission still has the option of appealing the court to the european court of justice , the eu ’ s highest judicial body .

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”

german chancellor schröder caused surprise when he promised to consider china ’ s request to buy a german plutonium factory recently .
however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany . if a retired steel worker from the westphalia region of germany wants to show his grandsons where he used to work , he may be faced with a slight dilemma . he could either show them the empty land where his steel plant once stood and rely on their imagination to fill in the gaps or he could fly them about 9,000 kilometers to the east to see where it currently resides .
because the plant where grandfather used to toil and sweat is now one of many german industrial sites that have been dismantled , shipped and reassembled in china . the end of a productive life for many german steel plants does not necessarily mean dilapidation or destruction in this day and age of global trade .
plants like the thyssen-krupp steelworks and the deutsche steinkohle ’ s kaiserstuhl cokery , both originally situated near dortmund , have found a new lease of life thanks to germany ’ s close trade ties with the people ’ s republic of china . from dortmund to shanghai bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after only eight operational years , the kaisterstuhl closed in 2000 , an uncertain fate stretching ahead of it .
that is until the chinese yankuang group , the state-owned mining conglomerate which also purchased the thyssen-krupp plant when it fell into disuse , purchased the 250,000 metric tonnes of steel jigsaw puzzle that is now being reconstructed near shanghai . it really seems that one man ’ s junk is another man ’ s treasure .
while germany adds to its reputation as the world ’ s number one exporter by including the sale of disused facilities abroad on its balance sheet , the chinese get cut-price factories and plants that are integral to its quest for social development . social development linked to coke “ as social development grows in china , the economy also becomes stronger and stronger , ” says yankuang group project manager mo lishi .
“ the people have more money , and the technology becomes more and more extensive : the need for heavy industry grows as does the need for more and more steel .
for that , we need coke , because without coke one can not melt steel . ” the resale of whole plants and factories is just the very large tip of a scrap yard iceberg built on the used machinery market which generates global revenue running well into hundreds of billions of dollars . trade fair offers global bargains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's re sale , the world ’ s leading trade fair for used machinery which has now recently moved to karlsruhe , attracts thousands of interested customers every year .
the majority come from eastern europe and many from developing industrial nations in asia .
the trade fair provides essential machinery – everything from computers and textile machines to medical and power plant equipment – which many companies would struggle to afford if they were new . it seems on the surface that everyone involved in the trade is a winner .
the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”
kahlenborn added that there is also the danger that the importing of used machinery and equipment into a country can damage the developing home-based market for industry hardware . despite these factors , the resale trade is booming .

the exporters , wanting to remain competitive in industry by having the latest machinery and technology , have a need to renew their equipment almost yearly .
the resale market gives industry in countries like germany the opportunity to dispose of their cast-off machinery to clients like the chinese , while foregoing expensive disposal charges , environmental problems and making money to boot . benefits from old machines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the import countries find themselves with bargains that can be built and made operational in a fraction of the time it takes to put together a brand new plant .
these older machines are also easier to repair than newer more complex models . but there are drawbacks .
used machinery often comes with the risk of pollution from previous operations and high levels of fuel consumption arising from the wear and tear the equipment has received over the years in its country of origin . importers ignore drawbacks for profit “ the buyers very rarely consider the environmental effects and generally high energy and resource consumption of these used machines , " says walter kahlenborn , manager of the independent consultation institute adelphi research . “ they mostly look only at the investment costs and maybe a little at the operating expenses . ”
kahlenborn added that there is also the danger that the importing of used machinery and equipment into a country can damage the developing home-based market for industry hardware . despite these factors , the resale trade is booming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.12.2003 german press review : " german weapons for the red mandarins " german newspapers commented on chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s visit to china and his controversial calls for lifting a weapons embargo and offering to sell a plutonium plant . in berlin , the conservative-oriented die welt spared no amount of sarcasm in praising schröder ’ s sudden outpouring of generosity .
" german weapons for the red mandarins ?
certainly , after all , the embargo is costing us jobs , " the paper waxed .
" german plutonium technology to the middle kingdom ?
why not – the red-green anti-nuclear consensus is just domestic folklore anyway .
one china with taiwan under the flag of the red dragon ?
go right ahead , " the editorial sneered .
the signals coming back from schröder ’ s sales tour of china are unmistakable , " the paper concluded : " you can make my life a misery at home by moaning about economic crisis and social reforms - but just let me off the hook and see me sweep aside all moral and political export barriers . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung also described good business relations with china as schröder ’ s top priority .
it criticized him for brushing aside concerns about beijing ’ s human rights record .
the paper commented that schröder has failed to understand that respect for human rights is a precondition for long-term investment ; and it warned that any country that fails this test remains potentially unstable .
" travel broadens the mind , " declared berlin ’ s tagesspiegel , and added that chancellor schröder has clearly learned a great deal .
" he ’ s discovered what he calls a ‘ new china , ’ and that seems to be reason enough to drop the arms embargo , " the paper sighed sarcastically .
although the majority of chinese have more freedom now than they used to , the paper noted , the rights of certain individuals are still greatly abused .
it cited the persecution of falun gong followers , as well as of the people in tibet and xinjiang .
if the chancellor pushes human rights issues and china ’ s threatening behavior towards taiwan onto the sidelines , both he and his china policy will lose all credibility , the paper warned .
but some of the smaller papers ventured to offer the chancellor some muted support .
dodging the deeper moral issues , the nordbayerischer kurier from bayreuth said that schröder ’ s decision to visit china every year was a clever one .
greater cooperation is good for both sides , it maintained .
china needs the innovation and skills the west can provide , while germany needs hungry new markets to encourage growth .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .
in all the others i sit on the floor , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”
becker did her part to support the protest action by helping to build a makeshift barricade of scrap wood and old furniture in front of the university ’ s courtyard .
the main building is plastered with banners and posters . there have also been the traditional protest marches , drawing as many as 20,000 students . unconventional , but effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests were stopped at berlin 's city hall on wednesday .
among the more unusual stunts was the storming of berlin ’ s city hall earlier in the week . students occupied the building for two hours until they were threatened with arrest . last week , students occupied the headquarters of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the junior coalition partner in the city-state 's government - in a similar action . in a more creative vein , a small group of students pitched their tents outside the scandinavian embassies , claiming educational asylum . and in a tent in front of the high-rise office towers at potsdamer platz , university students and professors held a 72-hour physics lecture open to anyone who cared to listen .
“ when i lectured on laser optics at 3 a.m. , all seats were taken with dozens of students listening from outside even though it was freezing , ” said professor paul fumagalli from berlin ’ s free university . the lecture was held both to protest budget cuts and beat the world record of 51 hours 44 minutes for the longest round-the-clock lecture set by 24-year old american dustin buehler earlier this year . berlin sociologist dieter rucht thinks these innovative forms of protest are new and effective .
past student strikes were often aimed at bringing university life to a standstill .
“ that left the public cold , ” rucht said . the 2003 strike , in contrast , is being played out in public spaces , and is challenging the stereotype of the lazy student . the creative protests might be swaying a sympathetic public , but so far , the berlin senate is unmoved . the students aren ’ t giving up , though , with more demonstrations in the works for the weeks to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : report blames school failures for dampening german economy the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn .

if it were real .
alas , the eternally smiling , 7.5 centimeter small playmobil figures made in zirndorf near nuremberg are only figures in a massive toy nation .
how huge ?
if you stretched out the arms of every playmobil figure ever sold and lined them up arm-in-arm , they would create a human chain that circled the globe two times .
turning an oil crisis into a toy boom every playmobil sold today is a descendant of the original toy created by horst brandstätter .
during the beginning of the 1970s , he used the international oil crisis to his advantage to create a boom in toy sales .
because oil prices also fueled an increase in plastic prices , the products that were being created in brandstätter ’ s toy factory - like a mini riding tractor - became too expensive to make . he needed to develop something smaller and more inexpensive to produce .
thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .

thus , playmobil was born .
the toy ’ s developers began researching drawings of people made by children and found that the face was the largest and most emphasized detail in their pictures .
that ’ s why they created figures with the oversized heads and hollowed bodies .
each face is comprised of only three parts : two saucer eyes and a permanent smile .
they ’ re still being made that way today , 30 years later .
the only thing that ’ s changed from the originals are the figures ’ somewhat clunky bodies with moveable arms and legs and the two hands that can grasp objects .
the more recent generations of playmobil people have hands that can be turned , and keeping with the times , the female figures can wear pants instead of skirts if they desire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a playmobil original knights , carpenters and indians were the first playmobil figures to come off the assembly line 30 years ago .
since then , the company has expanded its offerings to include over 600 hundred different characters in a dizzying array of thematic lines that include noah ’ s ark , vikings , stewardesses and much more .
there are farmers , priests , kings .
black , white and red faces .
the nation of playmobil figures populate both biblical times and today ’ s information age .
they ’ re multicultural and they span every class in society .
a fantasy world for kids and adult children playmobil ’ s secret of success lies in the figures ’ simple design , says gisela kupiak , a company spokeswoman .
the design stimulates children ’ s imaginations and lets them live out their dreams in a fantasy play world .
boys , especially , have long been crazy about the adventurous and , in some case , techno-fied toys .
in fact , they represent 70 percent of playmobil ’ s approximately € 268 million in annual sales .
but kids aren ’ t alone in their love of playmobil ’ s plastic fantasy world .
a recently opened exhibition in the southern german city of speyer , organized to honor playmobil ’ s 30th anniversary , also brings together the playmobil treasures of private collectors .
the show includes a nine-foot tall knight ’ s castle built in the style of “ lord of the rings ” by 31-year-old collector oliver deeg .
another collector , 36-year-old daniela schabenstiel has also put her own playmobil creation on display : a miniature opera with balconies , wardrobes and candelabras .
with his 5,200 figure collection , martin cierjaks has recreated the wars of the baroque era .
“ the scenarios can be used to explain world and cultural history and interpret them for children , ” says wolfgang leitmeyer , vice director of the speyer historical museum , reflecting on the mini worlds on display .
“ that encourages people to continue playing thoughtfully . ”
for a greater idea of the collective fascination with playmobil , a query on ebay , the great oracle of modern trends , is telling .
ebay ’ s german-language site includes more than 20,000 entries for playmobil items .
for some of the products , you can find bids of € 250 and higher .
and you can bet that the playmobil people themselves aren ’ t the only ones to find joy in the bidding wars . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : legolicious more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .

german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest . in berlin ’ s bustling friedrichstrasse train station , a group of about 40 people huddle together in a tight circle , papers in hand . passersby who stop to see what ’ s going on walk away confused . instead of a busker performance or sales pitch for souvenirs , the group is participating in a university lecture on japanese translation . holding a lecture in a train station is hardly the ideal learning environment - one of the students admitted that he could barely hear a thing over the din of the trains rumbling overhead . but such action does draw public attention and media coverage to the students ’ cause - protesting plans by the berlin senate to cut university funds by € 75 million by 2009 . students from berlin ’ s three universities have been on strike for a week now , and student leaders say they ’ re prepared to extend the strike by another week . they ’ re also putting togetheri a catalogue of demands , which includes a request to renegotiate the contract between the berlin senate and the cities three universities , and revoke the planned cuts . city not giving in berlin ’ s mayor , klaus wowereit , is standing firm . on wednesday , he rejected criticism of the budget cuts , and again called for the introduction of tuition fees . german students currently attend university free of charge . “ i want our public universities to be top-notch , competitive institutions , ” he said . tuition fees , he added , would help students focus more intensely on completing their studies . it ’ s not unusual for german students to take six years or longer to attain their university degrees . many berlin students say the planned cuts will only worsen the already poor conditions at the city ’ s universities . bärbel becker a third-year history student at historical humboldt university in the city 's east , says overcrowding and the high student-to-teacher ratio are just two of the problems .
“ i only have one seminar where i have a seat .
in all the others i sit on the floor , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ sometimes i don ’ t even see my professors and have never talked to them , so i don ’ t know how i should write my thesis , and don ’ t know how i will go on in my studies . ”
becker did her part to support the protest action by helping to build a makeshift barricade of scrap wood and old furniture in front of the university ’ s courtyard .
the main building is plastered with banners and posters . there have also been the traditional protest marches , drawing as many as 20,000 students . unconventional , but effective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests were stopped at berlin 's city hall on wednesday .
among the more unusual stunts was the storming of berlin ’ s city hall earlier in the week . students occupied the building for two hours until they were threatened with arrest . last week , students occupied the headquarters of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- - the junior coalition partner in the city-state 's government - in a similar action . in a more creative vein , a small group of students pitched their tents outside the scandinavian embassies , claiming educational asylum . and in a tent in front of the high-rise office towers at potsdamer platz , university students and professors held a 72-hour physics lecture open to anyone who cared to listen .
“ when i lectured on laser optics at 3 a.m. , all seats were taken with dozens of students listening from outside even though it was freezing , ” said professor paul fumagalli from berlin ’ s free university . the lecture was held both to protest budget cuts and beat the world record of 51 hours 44 minutes for the longest round-the-clock lecture set by 24-year old american dustin buehler earlier this year . berlin sociologist dieter rucht thinks these innovative forms of protest are new and effective .
past student strikes were often aimed at bringing university life to a standstill .
“ that left the public cold , ” rucht said . the 2003 strike , in contrast , is being played out in public spaces , and is challenging the stereotype of the lazy student . the creative protests might be swaying a sympathetic public , but so far , the berlin senate is unmoved . the students aren ’ t giving up , though , with more demonstrations in the works for the weeks to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : report blames school failures for dampening german economy the latest oecd report assessing international education has not only given the german system poor marks , but also says it is partially responsible for the country 's economic downturn .

current implants use chips that convert light into electrical impulses that are fed to the brain via the optic nerve .
the new device will work differently .
it will be placed on a damaged retina and convert light into chemicals that will stimulate nerve cells .
the prototype is being constructed at stanford university in california .
new approach dr stacey bent of stanford university calls the device " the holy grail of prostheses " .
it takes a new approach to replacing a damaged retina , the layer of cells at the back of the eye that detect light and send signals to the brain .
trauma or disease can damage or destroy retinal cells .
over the past few years implants have been developed to replace them based on electronic chips that turn light into electrical pulses .
but there are difficulties in placing electronics into the eye .
" the problem with electronic implants is while they are very good it is difficult to make them biocompatible , " dr bent told bbc news online .
" what we a trying to do is a different approach from the current attempts using electrodes to stimulate nerve cells in the eye . "
the new device works chemically rather than electronically .
" instead of using electrical stimulation from a chip that converts light into electric impulses , we are using an implant that releases neurotransmitters just as the retina does naturally . "
the researchers want light to strike the chip , causing it to release a small amount of neurotransmitter fluid that will stimulate retinal nerve cells .
attractive proteins the implant is to be made of a soft polymer material that will conform to the curvature of the back of the eye .
a key component will be retinal nerve cells that have been persuaded to grow behind the chip so that they can be stimulated effectively .
" we are working on pre-positioning nerve cells in a layer behind the implant , " dr bent said .
this way they will be in a better position to react to the stimulus from the light sensitive cells above them .
based on work carried out in the past decade , scientists believe they know how to persuade retinal nerve cells to align .
the back of the implant will be coated with proteins designed to attract filaments that grow out of retinal cells .
it is hoped they will connect the implant to the optic nerve , so that signals can be sent to the brain .
tests are planned of the device in the laboratory .
it will be stimulated with light and the nerve cells monitored to see if they respond .
if they are a success , animal tests will follow .

current implants use chips that convert light into electrical impulses that are fed to the brain via the optic nerve .
the new device will work differently .
it will be placed on a damaged retina and convert light into chemicals that will stimulate nerve cells .
the prototype is being constructed at stanford university in california .
new approach dr stacey bent of stanford university calls the device " the holy grail of prostheses " .
it takes a new approach to replacing a damaged retina , the layer of cells at the back of the eye that detect light and send signals to the brain .
trauma or disease can damage or destroy retinal cells .
over the past few years implants have been developed to replace them based on electronic chips that turn light into electrical pulses .
retinal nerve cells will be stimulated but there are difficulties in placing electronics into the eye .
" the problem with electronic implants is while they are very good it is difficult to make them biocompatible , " dr bent told bbc news online .
" what we a trying to do is a different approach from the current attempts using electrodes to stimulate nerve cells in the eye . "
the new device works chemically rather than electronically .
" instead of using electrical stimulation from a chip that converts light into electric impulses , we are using an implant that releases neurotransmitters just as the retina does naturally . "
the researchers want light to strike the chip , causing it to release a small amount of neurotransmitter fluid that will stimulate retinal nerve cells .
attractive proteins the implant is to be made of a soft polymer material that will conform to the curvature of the back of the eye .
a key component will be retinal nerve cells that have been persuaded to grow behind the chip so that they can be stimulated effectively .
" we are working on pre-positioning nerve cells in a layer behind the implant , " dr bent said .
this way they will be in a better position to react to the stimulus from the light sensitive cells above them .
based on work carried out in the past decade , scientists believe they know how to persuade retinal nerve cells to align .
the back of the implant will be coated with proteins designed to attract filaments that grow out of retinal cells .
it is hoped they will connect the implant to the optic nerve , so that signals can be sent to the brain .
tests are planned of the device in the laboratory .
it will be stimulated with light and the nerve cells monitored to see if they respond .
if they are a success , animal tests will follow .

they think there are from 400,000 to 660,000 elephants across the continent , with large numbers in southern africa .
but the scientists , from iucn-the world conservation union , are interpreting their findings with extreme caution .
they say one explanation may be that the elephants are fleeing to protected areas to try to escape human pressure , thus giving an unduly hopeful picture .
they say habitat loss and competition between people and elephants for resources remain among the principal challenges in elephant conservation .
the scientists are members of iucn 's african elephant specialist group , and their study , the african elephant status report , updates one produced in 1999 .
more questions than answers it is the latest in a series derived from a database on african elephants which since 1986 has been compiling information from the 37 countries where the animals live .
ivory poachers remain a potent threat the 1999 report concluded there were at least 300,000 elephants in africa , and possibly as many as 487,000 .
the updated version says the higher figures may be partly explained by reported increases in savanna elephant populations in botswana , tanzania and zimbabwe .
but one of the report 's authors , julian blanc , said the increase revealed little about how populations were faring at the continental level .
he suspected there could be a more worrying explanation for the apparent population growth - that the elephants were crowding together for safety .
he said : " most elephant surveys are restricted to protected areas , and it is precisely to protected areas that elephants flock when their range is compressed by expanding human populations .
" a high concentration of elephants in protected areas can give a misleading impression of increasing numbers . "
huge unknowns this crowding under pressure , known as " hyper-aggregation " , occurs in some other species , and was identified among north atlantic cod shortly before the collapse of canada 's grand banks fishery in the early 1990s .
there are still gaps in scientists ' knowledge the authors say there are other possible reasons for caution in interpreting the figures : one is that they are based on data from just over half the total area where elephants may live .
so much more work needs to be done in the unsurveyed areas to arrive at an accurate picture of changes in population .
julian blanc said : " we now have estimates covering a much larger area than we did five years ago - and that alone can go a long way in explaining differences in numbers - but there are still huge gaps in our knowledge . "
the update 's regional estimates show a wide variation , and considerable uncertainty : southern africa : from 246,000 " definite " to a " speculative " total of 300,000 animals eastern africa : at least 118,000 elephants , and possibly 163,000 central africa , with huge expanses of unprotected elephant range : somewhere between 16,500 and 196,000 animals west africa : perhaps only 5,500 elephants , and at most 13,200 .
julian blanc told bbc news online : " we know there are large , stable - in places perhaps increasing - elephant populations in southern and eastern africa , where the amount of monitoring effort is greatest .
" but even in these two regions there are countries - notably sudan and angola - with large areas of possible elephant range but about which we have virtually no information .
" this uncertainty not only applies to numbers .
although we have reported an important contraction and increased fragmentation in elephant range in many parts of the continent , it is impossible to say whether this is a recent phenomenon or simply the result of the availability of better information .
" at this stage , even with better information , it remains very difficult to disentangle real changes from perceived changes in elephant populations . "

but the scientists , from iucn-the world conservation union , are interpreting their findings with extreme caution .
they say one explanation may be that the elephants are fleeing to protected areas to try to escape human pressure , thus giving an unduly hopeful picture .
they say habitat loss and competition between people and elephants for resources remain among the principal challenges in elephant conservation .
the scientists are members of iucn 's african elephant specialist group , and their study , the african elephant status report , updates one produced in 1999 .
more questions than answers it is the latest in a series derived from a database on african elephants which since 1986 has been compiling information from the 37 countries where the animals live .
the 1999 report concluded there were at least 300,000 elephants in africa , and possibly as many as 487,000 .
the updated version says the higher figures may be partly explained by reported increases in savanna elephant populations in botswana , tanzania and zimbabwe .
but one of the report 's authors , julian blanc , said the increase revealed little about how populations were faring at the continental level .
he suspected there could be a more worrying explanation for the apparent population growth - that the elephants were crowding together for safety .
he said : " most elephant surveys are restricted to protected areas , and it is precisely to protected areas that elephants flock when their range is compressed by expanding human populations .
" a high concentration of elephants in protected areas can give a misleading impression of increasing numbers . "
huge unknowns this crowding under pressure , known as " hyper-aggregation " , occurs in some other species , and was identified among north atlantic cod shortly before the collapse of canada 's grand banks fishery in the early 1990s .
the authors say there are other possible reasons for caution in interpreting the figures : one is that they are based on data from just over half the total area where elephants may live .
so much more work needs to be done in the unsurveyed areas to arrive at an accurate picture of changes in population .
julian blanc said : " we now have estimates covering a much larger area than we did five years ago - and that alone can go a long way in explaining differences in numbers - but there are still huge gaps in our knowledge . "
the update 's regional estimates show a wide variation , and considerable uncertainty : southern africa : from 246,000 " definite " to a " speculative " total of 300,000 animals eastern africa : at least 118,000 elephants , and possibly 163,000 central africa , with huge expanses of unprotected elephant range : somewhere between 16,500 and 196,000 animals west africa : perhaps only 5,500 elephants , and at most 13,200 .
julian blanc told bbc news online : " we know there are large , stable - in places perhaps increasing - elephant populations in southern and eastern africa , where the amount of monitoring effort is greatest .
" but even in these two regions there are countries - notably sudan and angola - with large areas of possible elephant range but about which we have virtually no information .
" this uncertainty not only applies to numbers .
although we have reported an important contraction and increased fragmentation in elephant range in many parts of the continent , it is impossible to say whether this is a recent phenomenon or simply the result of the availability of better information .
" at this stage , even with better information , it remains very difficult to disentangle real changes from perceived changes in elephant populations . "

the first class dining saloon has been restored to its former glory and the ship 's stern has been fitted with gold leaf .
brunel 's ship - the world 's first screw propeller-driven vessel - was built in bristol in 1843 .

complaints were received about the show , which saw brown hold the pistol to his head and pull the trigger after it was apparently loaded with a bullet .
it was an illusion , and care was taken not to glamorise guns , the bsc said .
they also rejected complaints against bbc news 24 for showing pictures of us prisoners during the iraq war .
neither its content , nor that of the trails , had exceeded acceptable boundaries commission spokesman eight complaints were received about the trailer for the channel 4 programme on 5 october , and an equal number of complaints about the programme itself , saying it was distasteful , made light of suicide and promoted gun culture .
the commission decided the content and structure of the programme , and its place in channel 4 's magic month season meant viewers would know it was a trick , and that derren brown was a professional magician .
they also said the 15 minute delay on the broadcast would have prevented viewers from seeing brown harmed if the trick had gone wrong .
" given the programme 's broadcast post-watershed , on a minority channel and with unambiguous warnings , neither its content , nor that of the trails , had exceeded acceptable boundaries , " said a spokesman for the commission .
a single viewer complained about pictures of captured american prisoners shown on bbc news 24 in march .
the commission rejected the complaint , saying they were : " in the public interest , because they clearly showed the methods employed by the iraqi military in the treatment of their prisoners . "
