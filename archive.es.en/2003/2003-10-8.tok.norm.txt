the law is intended to make it easier for independent high-speed internet access companies to compete with former government monopolies .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .
previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .
23 from 0.75 percent to either 0.25 percent or zero .
the stagnating economy will make it more difficult to trim its own budget deficit , which berlin estimates will top at least 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year . but germany has partially avoided the critical gaze of the european commission by outlining detailed measures by which it will attempt to reduce its deficit next year .
any punitive measures for either france or germany appear unlikely at the moment , since they would first have to be approved by the council of ministers , where both paris and berlin have sizable influence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels .

compared to the last corruption index compiled in 2001 , germany has moved up four spots to number 16 on the list of least corrupt countries .
the head for ti in germany , hansjörg eishorst , attributed the improvement to changes instituted in international corporations and government agencies over the last few years .
whereas corruption used to be fairly commonplace among foreign companies operating in germany , such practices are illegal today and guilty companies risk losing their tax breaks , eishorst said at a press conference tuesday .
german civil servants have also been forced to tighten their standards and those employees cought with their fingers in the cookie jar are now handed a hefty punishment , if not fired outright .
however , eishorst warned that just as germany makes inroads in its battle to eliminate corruption , illegal practices such as blackmail could become more frequent when the european union expands eastward in 2004 .
" it is foreseeable that the pressure to ‘ play along with ’ corruption in government institutions , which has grown in the recent past , will continue to increase when the eu expands , " eishorst said . more briefs 07.10.2003 -pipe- german open wo n't leave berlin in 2004 07.10.2003 -pipe- bavaria reelects stoiber as premier 07.10.2003 -pipe- steffi graf has baby girl 05.10.2003 -pipe- 2 german soldiers killed in kosovo 05.10.2003 -pipe- jan ullrich returns to team telekom 03.10.2003 -pipe- german defense minister wants to downsize army 02.10.2003 -pipe- opposition leader blasts headscarf ruling 02.10.2003 -pipe- german schools face dire teacher crunch radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the law is intended to make it easier for independent high-speed internet access companies to compete with former government monopolies .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .

the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis . just like every year at this time , germany 's banking city metamorphoses into a city of books , as authors , literary agents , publishers and readers descend upon frankfurt for the book fair .
the fair 's organizers expect around 270,000 visitors from october 8 to 13 , 2 percent more than last year .
more exhibitors have registered , too - 6,611as opposed to 6,388 in 2002 .
the industry is starting to show signs of cautious optimism . " the book industry has been freed from a deep recession , " fair spokesman holger ehling said .
" there are signals that the industry is recovering , but a turnaround has n't been achieved yet . " publishers still expect to end the year in the red though , dieter schormann of the association of german publishers and booksellers said on tuesday .
although book sales went down by 4.9 percent in the first half of the year , the industry has started to profit from the german economy 's sluggish recovery .
christmas book sales , publication of the newest " harry potter " book in german and the frankfurt book fair itself should help the industry finish the year with only a 2 percent decline in profits , better than some feared . focus on russia despite the fair 's high profile , german chancellor gerhard schröder will not be making an appearance .
neither will his russian counterpart vladimir putin , despite the fact that the fair is meant to be the highpoint of the " russia year in germany . " the country of dostoevsky , gogol and solzhenitsyn is the " guest of honor " at the frankfurt trade fair and the russian government has spent more than $ 5 million -lrb- € 4.2 million -rrb- on its appearance there .
the bolshoi ballet will perform in the city and local museums are planning exhibitions on russian themes .
more than 100 russian writers are expected to be in town , including russian-german literary star and berlin club impresario wladimir kaminer .
kaminer and consorts have committed to putting on one of their legendary " russian discos " at the fair on friday night . world records and laureates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian writer paulo coelho finger cramps are likely to plague brazilian writer paulo coelho , who will be aiming to make the " guinness book of world records " for the most foreign-language books signed when he presents his new novel " the alchemist , " published in 56 languages .
nobel prize laureate günter grass will also be on hand - along with a band - to read from " last dances , " his latest book , and then take to the dance floor .
on sunday , american writer susan sontag will be awarded the peace prize of the german book trade , which is bestowed annually during the fair . the frankfurt book fair originated in the 15th century shortly after johannes gutenberg invented the first method of printing from movable type and the city developed into the most important center for books in central europe .
it has taken place in its present form since 1949 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leipzig goes literary the leipzig book fair opens on wednesday .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .
previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .
23 from 0.75 percent to either 0.25 percent or zero .
the stagnating economy will make it more difficult to trim its own budget deficit , which berlin estimates will top at least 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year . but germany has partially avoided the critical gaze of the european commission by outlining detailed measures by which it will attempt to reduce its deficit next year .
any punitive measures for either france or germany appear unlikely at the moment , since they would first have to be approved by the council of ministers , where both paris and berlin have sizable influence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2003 deutsche telekom and jan ullrich make nice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has come back into the telekom fold .
german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis . just like every year at this time , germany 's banking city metamorphoses into a city of books , as authors , literary agents , publishers and readers descend upon frankfurt for the book fair .
the fair 's organizers expect around 270,000 visitors from october 8 to 13 , 2 percent more than last year .
more exhibitors have registered , too - 6,611as opposed to 6,388 in 2002 .
the industry is starting to show signs of cautious optimism . " the book industry has been freed from a deep recession , " fair spokesman holger ehling said .
" there are signals that the industry is recovering , but a turnaround has n't been achieved yet . " publishers still expect to end the year in the red though , dieter schormann of the association of german publishers and booksellers said on tuesday .
although book sales went down by 4.9 percent in the first half of the year , the industry has started to profit from the german economy 's sluggish recovery .
christmas book sales , publication of the newest " harry potter " book in german and the frankfurt book fair itself should help the industry finish the year with only a 2 percent decline in profits , better than some feared . focus on russia despite the fair 's high profile , german chancellor gerhard schröder will not be making an appearance .
neither will his russian counterpart vladimir putin , despite the fact that the fair is meant to be the highpoint of the " russia year in germany . " the country of dostoevsky , gogol and solzhenitsyn is the " guest of honor " at the frankfurt trade fair and the russian government has spent more than $ 5 million -lrb- € 4.2 million -rrb- on its appearance there .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition .

paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .

the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .

previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2003 deutsche telekom and jan ullrich make nice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has come back into the telekom fold .
german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2003 deutsche telekom and jan ullrich make nice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has come back into the telekom fold .
german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .
arch rival lance armstrong now seems on the way to his fifth tour title .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .

compared to the last corruption index compiled in 2001 , germany has moved up four spots to number 16 on the list of least corrupt countries .
the head for ti in germany , hansjörg eishorst , attributed the improvement to changes instituted in international corporations and government agencies over the last few years .
whereas corruption used to be fairly commonplace among foreign companies operating in germany , such practices are illegal today and guilty companies risk losing their tax breaks , eishorst said at a press conference tuesday .
german civil servants have also been forced to tighten their standards and those employees cought with their fingers in the cookie jar are now handed a hefty punishment , if not fired outright .
however , eishorst warned that just as germany makes inroads in its battle to eliminate corruption , illegal practices such as blackmail could become more frequent when the european union expands eastward in 2004 .
" it is foreseeable that the pressure to ‘ play along with ’ corruption in government institutions , which has grown in the recent past , will continue to increase when the eu expands , " eishorst said . more briefs 07.10.2003 -pipe- german open wo n't leave berlin in 2004 07.10.2003 -pipe- bavaria reelects stoiber as premier 07.10.2003 -pipe- steffi graf has baby girl 05.10.2003 -pipe- 2 german soldiers killed in kosovo 05.10.2003 -pipe- jan ullrich returns to team telekom 03.10.2003 -pipe- german defense minister wants to downsize army 02.10.2003 -pipe- opposition leader blasts headscarf ruling 02.10.2003 -pipe- german schools face dire teacher crunch 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2003 deutsche telekom and jan ullrich make nice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has come back into the telekom fold .
german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition .

published reports on wednesday indicated that german finance minister hans eichel plans to change the existing law to prevent soccer clubs from making use of a tax privilege , originally created for nurses , shift workers and other low-income employees .
the new provision would cap the tax-free bonus for soccer clubs at € 12.50 per hour for games played after 8 p.m. and a maximum of € 25 for sunday games .
weeks ago it emerged that borussia dortmund players , who earned an average of € 4 million each , were receiving part of their hefty salaries in the form of tax-free bonuses , a practice that saved the stock exchange-listed club € 1.5 million per year . more briefs 08.10.2003 -pipe- germany faces eu suit over telecoms market 08.10.2003 -pipe- volkswagen sets sights on arab car market 07.10.2003 -pipe- government could cancel road toll contract 07.10.2003 -pipe- surprise rise in german manufacturing orders 07.10.2003 -pipe- steel workers walk off the job 02.10.2003 -pipe- steel firms to pay millions for fixing prices 02.10.2003 -pipe- vw offers brazilian workers deal 02.10.2003 -pipe- ecb keeps interest rates steady 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.10.2003 -pipe- 08:00 utc germany improves fight against corruption according to a report published by the organization transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , germany has made small steps towards wiping out corruption .
compared to the last corruption index compiled in 2001 , germany has moved up four spots to number 16 on the list of least corrupt countries .
the head for ti in germany , hansjörg eishorst , attributed the improvement to changes instituted in international corporations and government agencies over the last few years .
whereas corruption used to be fairly commonplace among foreign companies operating in germany , such practices are illegal today and guilty companies risk losing their tax breaks , eishorst said at a press conference tuesday .

compared to the last corruption index compiled in 2001 , germany has moved up four spots to number 16 on the list of least corrupt countries .
the head for ti in germany , hansjörg eishorst , attributed the improvement to changes instituted in international corporations and government agencies over the last few years .
whereas corruption used to be fairly commonplace among foreign companies operating in germany , such practices are illegal today and guilty companies risk losing their tax breaks , eishorst said at a press conference tuesday .
german civil servants have also been forced to tighten their standards and those employees cought with their fingers in the cookie jar are now handed a hefty punishment , if not fired outright .
however , eishorst warned that just as germany makes inroads in its battle to eliminate corruption , illegal practices such as blackmail could become more frequent when the european union expands eastward in 2004 .
" it is foreseeable that the pressure to ‘ play along with ’ corruption in government institutions , which has grown in the recent past , will continue to increase when the eu expands , " eishorst said . more briefs 07.10.2003 -pipe- german open wo n't leave berlin in 2004 07.10.2003 -pipe- bavaria reelects stoiber as premier 07.10.2003 -pipe- steffi graf has baby girl 05.10.2003 -pipe- 2 german soldiers killed in kosovo 05.10.2003 -pipe- jan ullrich returns to team telekom 03.10.2003 -pipe- german defense minister wants to downsize army 02.10.2003 -pipe- opposition leader blasts headscarf ruling 02.10.2003 -pipe- german schools face dire teacher crunch 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .
previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .
23 from 0.75 percent to either 0.25 percent or zero .
the stagnating economy will make it more difficult to trim its own budget deficit , which berlin estimates will top at least 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year . but germany has partially avoided the critical gaze of the european commission by outlining detailed measures by which it will attempt to reduce its deficit next year .
any punitive measures for either france or germany appear unlikely at the moment , since they would first have to be approved by the council of ministers , where both paris and berlin have sizable influence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2003 deutsche telekom and jan ullrich make nice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich has come back into the telekom fold .
german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

published reports on wednesday indicated that german finance minister hans eichel plans to change the existing law to prevent soccer clubs from making use of a tax privilege , originally created for nurses , shift workers and other low-income employees .
the new provision would cap the tax-free bonus for soccer clubs at € 12.50 per hour for games played after 8 p.m. and a maximum of € 25 for sunday games .
weeks ago it emerged that borussia dortmund players , who earned an average of € 4 million each , were receiving part of their hefty salaries in the form of tax-free bonuses , a practice that saved the stock exchange-listed club € 1.5 million per year . more briefs 08.10.2003 -pipe- germany faces eu suit over telecoms market 08.10.2003 -pipe- volkswagen sets sights on arab car market 07.10.2003 -pipe- government could cancel road toll contract 07.10.2003 -pipe- surprise rise in german manufacturing orders 07.10.2003 -pipe- steel workers walk off the job 02.10.2003 -pipe- steel firms to pay millions for fixing prices 02.10.2003 -pipe- vw offers brazilian workers deal 02.10.2003 -pipe- ecb keeps interest rates steady 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .

compared to the last corruption index compiled in 2001 , germany has moved up four spots to number 16 on the list of least corrupt countries .
the head for ti in germany , hansjörg eishorst , attributed the improvement to changes instituted in international corporations and government agencies over the last few years .
whereas corruption used to be fairly commonplace among foreign companies operating in germany , such practices are illegal today and guilty companies risk losing their tax breaks , eishorst said at a press conference tuesday .
german civil servants have also been forced to tighten their standards and those employees cought with their fingers in the cookie jar are now handed a hefty punishment , if not fired outright .
however , eishorst warned that just as germany makes inroads in its battle to eliminate corruption , illegal practices such as blackmail could become more frequent when the european union expands eastward in 2004 .
" it is foreseeable that the pressure to ‘ play along with ’ corruption in government institutions , which has grown in the recent past , will continue to increase when the eu expands , " eishorst said . more briefs 07.10.2003 -pipe- german open wo n't leave berlin in 2004 07.10.2003 -pipe- bavaria reelects stoiber as premier 07.10.2003 -pipe- steffi graf has baby girl 05.10.2003 -pipe- 2 german soldiers killed in kosovo 05.10.2003 -pipe- jan ullrich returns to team telekom 03.10.2003 -pipe- german defense minister wants to downsize army 02.10.2003 -pipe- opposition leader blasts headscarf ruling 02.10.2003 -pipe- german schools face dire teacher crunch 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .
previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .
23 from 0.75 percent to either 0.25 percent or zero .
the stagnating economy will make it more difficult to trim its own budget deficit , which berlin estimates will top at least 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year . but germany has partially avoided the critical gaze of the european commission by outlining detailed measures by which it will attempt to reduce its deficit next year .
any punitive measures for either france or germany appear unlikely at the moment , since they would first have to be approved by the council of ministers , where both paris and berlin have sizable influence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels .

the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis . just like every year at this time , germany 's banking city metamorphoses into a city of books , as authors , literary agents , publishers and readers descend upon frankfurt for the book fair .
the fair 's organizers expect around 270,000 visitors from october 8 to 13 , 2 percent more than last year .
more exhibitors have registered , too - 6,611as opposed to 6,388 in 2002 .
the industry is starting to show signs of cautious optimism . " the book industry has been freed from a deep recession , " fair spokesman holger ehling said .
" there are signals that the industry is recovering , but a turnaround has n't been achieved yet . " publishers still expect to end the year in the red though , dieter schormann of the association of german publishers and booksellers said on tuesday .
although book sales went down by 4.9 percent in the first half of the year , the industry has started to profit from the german economy 's sluggish recovery .

compared to the last corruption index compiled in 2001 , germany has moved up four spots to number 16 on the list of least corrupt countries .
the head for ti in germany , hansjörg eishorst , attributed the improvement to changes instituted in international corporations and government agencies over the last few years .
whereas corruption used to be fairly commonplace among foreign companies operating in germany , such practices are illegal today and guilty companies risk losing their tax breaks , eishorst said at a press conference tuesday .
german civil servants have also been forced to tighten their standards and those employees cought with their fingers in the cookie jar are now handed a hefty punishment , if not fired outright .
however , eishorst warned that just as germany makes inroads in its battle to eliminate corruption , illegal practices such as blackmail could become more frequent when the european union expands eastward in 2004 .
" it is foreseeable that the pressure to ‘ play along with ’ corruption in government institutions , which has grown in the recent past , will continue to increase when the eu expands , " eishorst said . more briefs 07.10.2003 -pipe- german open wo n't leave berlin in 2004 07.10.2003 -pipe- bavaria reelects stoiber as premier 07.10.2003 -pipe- steffi graf has baby girl 05.10.2003 -pipe- 2 german soldiers killed in kosovo 05.10.2003 -pipe- jan ullrich returns to team telekom 03.10.2003 -pipe- german defense minister wants to downsize army 02.10.2003 -pipe- opposition leader blasts headscarf ruling 02.10.2003 -pipe- german schools face dire teacher crunch 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .
previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .
23 from 0.75 percent to either 0.25 percent or zero .
the stagnating economy will make it more difficult to trim its own budget deficit , which berlin estimates will top at least 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year . but germany has partially avoided the critical gaze of the european commission by outlining detailed measures by which it will attempt to reduce its deficit next year .
any punitive measures for either france or germany appear unlikely at the moment , since they would first have to be approved by the council of ministers , where both paris and berlin have sizable influence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels .

published reports on wednesday indicated that german finance minister hans eichel plans to change the existing law to prevent soccer clubs from making use of a tax privilege , originally created for nurses , shift workers and other low-income employees .
the new provision would cap the tax-free bonus for soccer clubs at € 12.50 per hour for games played after 8 p.m. and a maximum of € 25 for sunday games .
weeks ago it emerged that borussia dortmund players , who earned an average of € 4 million each , were receiving part of their hefty salaries in the form of tax-free bonuses , a practice that saved the stock exchange-listed club € 1.5 million per year . more briefs 08.10.2003 -pipe- germany faces eu suit over telecoms market 08.10.2003 -pipe- volkswagen sets sights on arab car market 07.10.2003 -pipe- government could cancel road toll contract 07.10.2003 -pipe- surprise rise in german manufacturing orders 07.10.2003 -pipe- steel workers walk off the job 02.10.2003 -pipe- steel firms to pay millions for fixing prices 02.10.2003 -pipe- vw offers brazilian workers deal 02.10.2003 -pipe- ecb keeps interest rates steady 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .
previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .
23 from 0.75 percent to either 0.25 percent or zero .
the stagnating economy will make it more difficult to trim its own budget deficit , which berlin estimates will top at least 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year . but germany has partially avoided the critical gaze of the european commission by outlining detailed measures by which it will attempt to reduce its deficit next year .
any punitive measures for either france or germany appear unlikely at the moment , since they would first have to be approved by the council of ministers , where both paris and berlin have sizable influence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .
previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .
23 from 0.75 percent to either 0.25 percent or zero .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition .

published reports on wednesday indicated that german finance minister hans eichel plans to change the existing law to prevent soccer clubs from making use of a tax privilege , originally created for nurses , shift workers and other low-income employees .
the new provision would cap the tax-free bonus for soccer clubs at € 12.50 per hour for games played after 8 p.m. and a maximum of € 25 for sunday games .
weeks ago it emerged that borussia dortmund players , who earned an average of € 4 million each , were receiving part of their hefty salaries in the form of tax-free bonuses , a practice that saved the stock exchange-listed club € 1.5 million per year . more briefs 08.10.2003 -pipe- germany faces eu suit over telecoms market 08.10.2003 -pipe- volkswagen sets sights on arab car market 07.10.2003 -pipe- government could cancel road toll contract 07.10.2003 -pipe- surprise rise in german manufacturing orders 07.10.2003 -pipe- steel workers walk off the job 02.10.2003 -pipe- steel firms to pay millions for fixing prices 02.10.2003 -pipe- vw offers brazilian workers deal 02.10.2003 -pipe- ecb keeps interest rates steady 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition .

budget trouble for the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued on wednesday , as eu officials criticized france over its deficit and germany appeared set to cut its growth forecast and increase borrowing this year . as expected , the european commission on wednesday reprimanded the french government for not doing enough to lower its budget deficit below the european union 's euro zone limits .
paris has forecast a 2004 deficit of 3.6 percent , which would mean france would stay above the 3.0 percent deficit of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- limit as set by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact for the third straight year . since paris did not meet a oct .
3 deadline to say how it plans to reduce its projected 2004 deficit , eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes will now draw up detailed budget recommendations this month .
the move will mark the most severe steps brussels has taken yet in enforcing the pact that was designed to protect the stability of the euro in the 12-nation currency zone .
moreover , france could be fined up to € 3 billion under the terms of the stability pact . although the commission , which acts as the eu ’ s executive , noted that paris had started to take steps to get its deficit under control , in a statement it said “ the commission is of the opinion that these improvements are not enough . ” smaller countries that have worked hard to keep their budgets in order like the netherlands and austria pushed for a hard line to be taken against paris at a meeting of eu finance minister this week in luxembourg .
but brussels stopped short of officially censuring france , since many other euro zone countries – in particular germany and portugal – are also struggling with their budget deficits .
“ what matters is whether france has moved any .
that she has , ” said german finance minister hans eichel . berlin ’ s woes as if to underscore the woes of europe ’ s largest economy , german government officials on wednesday confirmed media reports that berlin would likely lower its 2003 growth forecast and was on course to break all records for borrowing this year . the german government now expects to borrow a reported € 41.9 billion this year , which would be an all-time record budget deficit .
previously , berlin had planned only 18.9 billion in debt for 2003 , but sluggish growth and unforeseen expenditures .
“ it will definitely be double of what was planned , ” a spokesman for the finance ministry said . the government is now also expected to slash its growth forecast on oct .
23 from 0.75 percent to either 0.25 percent or zero .
the stagnating economy will make it more difficult to trim its own budget deficit , which berlin estimates will top at least 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year . but germany has partially avoided the critical gaze of the european commission by outlining detailed measures by which it will attempt to reduce its deficit next year .
any punitive measures for either france or germany appear unlikely at the moment , since they would first have to be approved by the council of ministers , where both paris and berlin have sizable influence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance meetings focus on deficit busters , growth finance ministers of the eu are holding meetings this week to discuss ballooning deficits , budget rules and possible punishments for france and germany for violating euro zone deficit levels .

german cycling star jan ullrich has announced he will once again don the pink jersey of team telekom .
the return of telekom ’ s prodigal son is likely to prove beneficial to both racer and sponsor . only a year after leaving the squad following a racing ban for drug use , ullrich on sunday rejoined deutsche telekom ’ s team .
the move is both an important step in ullrich ’ s return to the sport ’ s upper ranks and a marketing coup for the telecom behemoth . the 29 year-old ullrich has had a roller-coaster ride with his long-time cycling sponsor deutsche telekom .
after joining team telekom in 1995 , he quickly became the outfit ’ s star cyclist , culminating in his 1997 tour de france victory .
however , things quickly went south after that win and telekom unceremoniously dumped ullrich last year , as he battled with reoccurring knee problems and recreational drug use that led to a racing ban after testing positive for amphetamines . some may be surprised by ullrich ’ s decision to return to the team that was so quick to spurn him , but in many ways it ’ s a mercenary deal on both sides : telekom wants the exposure and ullrich wants to win the tour de france again .
although he managed a spectacular comeback and well-deserved second place finish at this year ’ s tour , he had expressed concern that his last sponsor bianchi could not cobble together the necessary talent to win in 2004 . “ the deciding factor was that i ’ ve been second at the tour often enough , and in coming years i ’ d like to mount a challenge – and for that i need a team that is strong enough , ” ullrich said on sunday at a press conference . telekom certainly has the depth needed to unseat ullrich ’ s rival texan lance amstrong , who has dominated the tour de france since the german ’ s victory in 1997 .
racing alongside ullrich next year will be 2003 tour third place finisher alexander vinokourov and sprint-meister erik zabel . lucrative three-year contract and then of course there ’ s the estimated € 8 million -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- telekom will pay him to wear the pink jersey of its wireless t-mobile unit for the next three years to sweeten the deal .
but in light of ullrich ’ s impressive comeback and his immense popularity in germany and elsewhere , t-mobile executive rené obermann considers it money well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we believe that jan ullrich is definitely worth the price that we ’ re investing and that we are not paying too much , ” obermann said .
“ besides he apparently had better offers than ours on the table . ” the mobile operator is hoping to bask in the success that seems pre-programmed following ullrich ’ s newfound competitive instincts and desire to win , according to gerhard schwede , an economist from the university of münster .
he said another tour de france victory would more than outweigh ullrich ’ s past crises in the minds of fans . “ what is necessary at the tour de france is absolute top performance , long endurance and always staying at the front – those are attributes that t-mobile would like to have , ” schwede told deutsche welle . so t-mobile is likely to cater to its prodigal son ’ s every need now , even though ullrich ’ s decision to come back to the telekom fold probably has less to do with his sympathies for the company than the realization that it could be an advertising cash cow for him even long after he ’ s stopped cycling . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crash puts brakes on ullrich 's cycling tour dream jan ullrich ’ s hopes of winning the 90th tour de france were dashed after a crash during the decisive individual time trial stretch on saturday .

germany 's parliament votes on october 17 on labor market reforms that critics say will lead to painful cuts for people in and out of work .
deutsche welle explains what they are . economists and business leaders have lamented for years that germany 's labor market regulations are hopelessly out of date and do little to halt the skyrocketing unemployment rate - currently at 4.3 million .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens started taking steps last year to change that .
the hartz commission , a committee headed up by volkswagen ceo peter hartz and affiliated with the spd , proposed the first widespread job reforms .
some of them have already been implemented while others are still waiting to pass through parliament .
all are part of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ambitious agenda 2010 package of social and economic reforms , designed to kickstart the moribund economy .
on october 17 the german parliament will vote on the labor market reforms .
if the bundestag approves them , they will be sent to the bundesrat - the second chamber of parliament representing germany 's federal states - for endorsement before becoming law .
" it is high time for the reforms , and we can not and we must not allow the situation to worsen , " wolfgang clement , germany ’ s minister for economics and labor , has said of the biggest overhaul of the labor market to hit germany in a while .
here 's a brief guide to the changes that have been implemented so far and those waiting for approval : jobless benefits limited to one year starting in 2006 , the unemployed will be able to claim benefits for 12 months , and those above age 55 for 18 months .
until now those without jobs have been able to claim unemployment benefits for 32 months .
clement and other labor market experts have criticized the generosity of the current situation , which has not infrequently been abused by companies who had convinced older employees to take early retirement , register themselves jobless and collect unemployment benefits until they could receive pensions at 60 , the earliest legal retirement age .
job protection relaxed firms with up to five employees will be freed from job protection regulations .
they will be allowed to hire up to five people either on a temporary or permanent basis without facing restrictions preventing them from firing workers .
by loosening the laws for small businesses , the government hopes to encourage companies to hire more people .
self-employment subsidized back in january the government passed a new law called the " ich ag " -lrb- roughly translated , " me inc . " -rrb- designed to make it easier for people to become self-employed .
whoever is unemployed may apply for financial support for three years while starting up a business .
tax-free income limit raised to € 400 " mini " jobs that previously paid € 325 per month can up that sum to € 400 since april 2003 .
the tax-free jobs are also no longer restricted to 15 hours per week , and non-wage labor costs are significantly lower than normal .
unemployment benefit restructured one of the heftiest criticized reform proposals is the restructuring of long-term unemployment benefits .
the hartz commission has called for rolling unemployment and social welfare benefits into one program to support people who have been without a job for more than 12 months and are still capable of working , i.e. those who fall under the legal retirement age .
up to now the two benefit systems have existed separately , with the federal government being responsible for unemployment payments and local authorities for social welfare .
" unemployment benefit ii , " as the reform has been dubbed , will be set at the level of social welfare benefits , which is significantly lower than current unemployment benefits based on a percentage of the previous earned income .
the government hopes to cut costs by only having one type of welfare benefit .
the question of setting the level of that benefit , however , is still a point of discussion for the social democrats and the opposition christian democratic union .
the conservative cdu has argued that the long-term jobless should be forced to get off the dole and work , and that by lowering their benefits they would be encouraged to take a job .
but the left-wing faction in the spd has criticized the lowering of unemployment benefits , saying that no one should be forced to take a job significantly below his or her skill level . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd to offer left-wing rebels concessions over reforms germany ’ s ruling social democratic party on tuesday appeared willing to offer left-wing rebels concessions in order to secure their support for key economic and welfare reforms .
but the reforms have split the opposition .

in keep off the grass , a report published on wednesday , the party says there is an urgent need for more recreation grounds because of london 's growing population and worsening obesity rates .
it says applications for developments on playing fields in london have more than doubled in the last four years .
the government should give strong , statutory protection to playing fields to prevent their loss , the report concludes .
noel lynch , london assembly green party member , said new schools and privately-run sports facilities were being built on green sites .
" fields once built on are lost forever " , he said .
rather than investing in schools sports fields , they -lrb- the government -rrb- encourage the selling-off of valuable resources to save government budgets noel lynch , london assembly member , green " playing fields are vital to the well-being of londoners .
they provide us with not just a place for sports , but also somewhere for walking or just to sit out in an open green space . "
the report condemned the government and london boroughs for not doing enough to protect playing fields .
there have been 202 planning approvals for development on school fields in london since 1998 .
stronger regulations " rather than investing in schools sports fields , they -lrb- the government -rrb- encourage the selling-off of valuable resources to save government budgets " , mr lynch said .
the report 's recommendations include statutory protection to playing fields and recreation grounds , whether public or private , the renovation of existing facilities and the development of new ones on brownfield land .
it says school playing fields should not be disposed of unless alternative facilities are provided .
but the government said stronger regulations on school field planning applications , introduced in 1998 , had made it more difficult to do away with them .

no longer content just to deliver other people 's lines , many hollywood stars aspire at some stage in their career to become directors , producers or writers .
perhaps that 's what arnold schwarzenegger is really up to - only he has chosen politics !
let 's face it , celebrity is what this election was all about .
actress diane keaton turned out for an anti-recall rally california is merely applying the guiding principal of its public life to the one area that had almost miraculously been spared it - politics .
it always seemed odd that this star-struck state should elect a governor , gray davis , who embodied the antithesis of charisma .
i met mr davis at his final rally in san francisco on monday .
his campaign had mobilised the one union that every american politician wants on his or her side after 9/11 - the firefighters .
hundreds of burly men with gravelly voices and knuckle-breaking handshakes donned silly ' no recall ' t-shirts , and marched towards union square .
in their midst , the reed-like governor with his tapering features and bloodless complexion looked like a blanched twig floating amongst logs .
his high-fives seemed self conscious and contrived .
i feared for his delicate hands .
no-one in the square shouted his name .
in fact his name was almost taboo , the mere mention of which would bring out the recall demons .
instead they all yelled : " no to the recall " .
" why ? "
i asked some of the firefighters .
" surely arnie is your kind of man ? "
" arnie is a squillionaire , " came the response from the gravel-voiced chorus .
" with his plans to cut taxes and spending he is bound to take away our jobs . "
who knows ?
arnie has played his economic cards very close to his well-toned chest .
antidote " not a bad turnout , " i told an old friend i bumped into at union square .
she is the bureau chief for newsweek in san francisco .
arnie is also pro-choice , not anti-gay and he is married to a kennedy - this makes him very acceptable to mainstream californians she pointed out that if it had n't been for the firefighters , the square would be almost deserted apart from a few tourists and office workers sipping their lattes .
this is the heartland of democratic america where almost no-one voted for george w bush in 2000 .
they should have been hanging from lampposts and balconies to support their man .
and they were not .
gray davis is the antidote to california celebrity , but he has also neglected his electoral base and presided over the mismanagement of the golden state .
so why did n't he get thrown out 11 months ago at the mid-term elections ?
simple answer - he was running against a republican party that was divided and had slipped too far to the right for the taste of moderate , mainstream californians .
today ronald reagan may be the hero of the republican right but as governor of california he enacted the most pro-choice legislation the state had ever seen .
dream card this is where arnie comes in .
ok , his lines may be wooden and his smile trapped in an ecstatic hollywood rictus .
but on paper , the terminator was as much a dream candidate for the republicans as former general , wesley clark , is for the democrats in the presidential race .
arnie looks like a red meat-devouring barbarian , but he is also pro-choice , not anti-gay and he is married to a kennedy .
this makes him unacceptable to most bible-bashing republicans from the south , but very acceptable to mainstream californians .
schwarzenegger has a cross-section of support in the white house , they still have n't made up their minds if an arnie victory in the most populous state , and one with the largest number of electoral college votes , is a good thing because it reverses the terminal decline of the republican party in california or bad because it dilutes the dixie-fication of the grand old party , the gop .
i went to arnie 's last rally in an aircraft hanger for executive jets at san jose airport .
the fact it had been booked by a recall campaign instead of silicon valley tycoons parking their gulfstreams spoke volumes of the parlous state of the californian economy .
the crowd was a motley array of arnistas - a true cross-section of one of the most motley corners of america .
there was a white-haired , white granny with a zimmer frame who told me she admired the body builder because he was strong .
then there was a car mechanic who liked arnie even more after he was accused of having groped no fewer than 15 women : " at least they were women . "
a mexican immigrant turned up in a two-ton hummer gas guzzler with a sticker " red , white and blue - these colours do n't run " .
the avon lady , immaculately turned out and brittle as a porcelain doll who i later saw hover expectantly behind arnie .
and the hardcore feminist who still supported the " grope-amater " despite his wandering hands .

by richard black bbc science correspondent california has selected its governor in an election where many cast their votes not by putting a cross on a ballot paper , or by punching holes in a piece of card , but on computerised electronic voting machines .
critics say the ballot cast via a computer is insecure in the wake of the fiasco in florida during the last presidential election in 2000 , these machines are seen by many in the us as a way of ensuring a fair vote .
they are slowly being introduced across the nation .
they have also been used in a number of other countries including the united kingdom , spain , india , australia and costa rica .
but some computer experts believe e-voting could actually make fraud much easier .
smart cards it is being used more and more across the us partly because of legislation called the help america vote act , signed by president bush in october 2002 .
someone working at a poll site can modify one file very easily on the voting terminal and have votes for one candidate actually count for another candidate prof avi rubin , johns hopkins university the act does not force states to switch to e-voting , but it sets standards for the conduct of elections and the maintenance of the electoral register which can most easily be met by switching to computers .
it also provides funds for states to help them make the switch .
there are several companies making these machines and they work in slightly different ways .
you 're never going to secure anything totally - if someone wants to get into a bank and rob it , they 're going to mark struckman , center for digital government typically a voter swipes a " smart card " through the machine , then uses a touchscreen to cast his or her vote .
proponents of e-voting list several advantages : the machines can switch to a language of the voter 's choice , they can easily be adapted for use by the blind , they count votes in an instant , they prevent spoiled ballots - for example , by refusing to allow the voter to select two candidates in a vote where they are only allowed to select one .
' poorly written ' some computer experts though are unconvinced .
the 2000 us presidential election descended into farce one is avi rubin , technical director of the information security institute at johns hopkins university in baltimore .
earlier this year , through a chance discovery , he was able to examine the computer programme , the source code , used in a voting machine made by diebold , one of the largest manufacturing companies .
" the source code was very poorly written , it did n't have the kinds of controls in place that you would expect from a high-assurance system , " prof rubin told bbc news online .
an ordinary voter could alter the outcome of an election , he believes .
the smart card is supposed to ensure that each person votes only once .
but prof rubin thinks it would be easy for a computer-savvy voter to make a fake card allowing multiple votes .
" an undergraduate in my class could do it , " he says .
he found that people involved in running the election could attack the system even more efficiently .
" even more serious would be a rogue or malicious programmer working at diebold who could put in some hidden functionality that could cause the outcome of the election to be later determined by the attacker , " he says .
' systems secure ' the johns hopkins team set out their concerns in a report published in july .
e-voting could mean an end to the walk to the polling station diebold has responded publicly to the johns hopkins report , though the company declined to be interviewed by the bbc .
it believes that prof rubin 's methodology and conclusions are fundamentally flawed ; along with other manufacturers , diebold says e-voting systems are in the main secure .
and in any case , say supporters of e-voting , nothing can be completely safe .
" you 're never going to secure anything totally - if someone wants to get into a bank and rob it , they 're going to , " says mark struckman , director of research at the center for digital government , an independent research and consultancy firm .
" these systems though can provide electronic means to make sure that if people are hacking , you can discover that .
' paper trail ' mr struckman believes that all machines should produce a " voter-verifiable paper trail " - a slip of paper which the voter can take away , like a receipt , as a record of how he or she voted .
not all machines currently produce these paper slips ; and some observers are concerned that without one , there is no record of how people voted other than what is contained in the machine 's computer memory .
another aspect of the way electronic voting is being introduced across the us which alarms some citizens is the close ties which some manufacturers have to prominent republican politicians .
diebold chief executive wally o 'dell has been a major fund-raiser for president bush .
senator chuck hagel used to chair a company , american information systems , which made voting machines , and retains investments in the mccarthy group , a parent company of the biggest manufacturer , election systems and software .
there 's no evidence that anyone has ever tried to rig an e-election , but some observers see a potential conflict of interest .
mr struckman however believes it is not an issue .
" if one company is fixing elections in the future , and it 's because they have ties to a certain political party or not , those things will be uncovered - that company will be ruined , " he told bbc news online .
prof rubin , however , maintains that elections are just too important to be run on computer systems which , he believes , can never be totally secure .
he says he would be happier voting using old-fashioned pen and paper .
" as a voter i will be very disappointed if at the next election i walk into the voting booth and am presented with an electronic voting machine , " he says .

by richard black bbc science correspondent california has selected its governor in an election where many cast their votes not by putting a cross on a ballot paper , or by punching holes in a piece of card , but on computerised electronic voting machines .
critics say the ballot cast via a computer is insecure in the wake of the fiasco in florida during the last presidential election in 2000 , these machines are seen by many in the us as a way of ensuring a fair vote .
they are slowly being introduced across the nation .
they have also been used in a number of other countries including the united kingdom , spain , india , australia and costa rica .
but some computer experts believe e-voting could actually make fraud much easier .
smart cards it is being used more and more across the us partly because of legislation called the help america vote act , signed by president bush in october 2002 .
someone working at a poll site can modify one file very easily on the voting terminal and have votes for one candidate actually count for another candidate prof avi rubin , johns hopkins university the act does not force states to switch to e-voting , but it sets standards for the conduct of elections and the maintenance of the electoral register which can most easily be met by switching to computers .
it also provides funds for states to help them make the switch .
there are several companies making these machines and they work in slightly different ways .
you 're never going to secure anything totally - if someone wants to get into a bank and rob it , they 're going to mark struckman , center for digital government typically a voter swipes a " smart card " through the machine , then uses a touchscreen to cast his or her vote .
proponents of e-voting list several advantages : the machines can switch to a language of the voter 's choice , they can easily be adapted for use by the blind , they count votes in an instant , they prevent spoiled ballots - for example , by refusing to allow the voter to select two candidates in a vote where they are only allowed to select one .
' poorly written ' some computer experts though are unconvinced .
the 2000 us presidential election descended into farce one is avi rubin , technical director of the information security institute at johns hopkins university in baltimore .
earlier this year , through a chance discovery , he was able to examine the computer programme , the source code , used in a voting machine made by diebold , one of the largest manufacturing companies .
" the source code was very poorly written , it did n't have the kinds of controls in place that you would expect from a high-assurance system , " prof rubin told bbc news online .
an ordinary voter could alter the outcome of an election , he believes .
the smart card is supposed to ensure that each person votes only once .
but prof rubin thinks it would be easy for a computer-savvy voter to make a fake card allowing multiple votes .
" an undergraduate in my class could do it , " he says .
he found that people involved in running the election could attack the system even more efficiently .
" even more serious would be a rogue or malicious programmer working at diebold who could put in some hidden functionality that could cause the outcome of the election to be later determined by the attacker , " he says .
' systems secure ' the johns hopkins team set out their concerns in a report published in july .
e-voting could mean an end to the walk to the polling station diebold has responded publicly to the johns hopkins report , though the company declined to be interviewed by the bbc .

of the three regional economic powerhouses , china agreed to a framework free trade deal with the association of south-east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- in 2002 .
now - as the asean summit wraps up on wednesday in bali - indonesia , india and japan are negotiating their own versions to cut back on both tariffs and other barriers to trade .
and china extended its own involvement by signing up to asean 's 1976 treaty of amity and co-operation on wednesday , which calls for dialogue-based solutions to both political and economic disputes .
varied agendas under the deals signed by china and asean , a vast free-trade area of 1.7 billion people is envisaged by 2010 .
adding india and japan to the grouping would expand it to cover almost half the world 's population .
" it 's going to be a vibrant market and india wants to be a part of it , " indian industrialist jamshed godrej told bbc world business report .
asean leaders have already committed - in the bali concord ii signed on tuesday - to convert their free-trade area into a full-blown economic community by 2020 .
asean member countries brunei burma cambodia indonesia laos malaysia philippines singapore thailand vietnam unsurprisingly , the agendas of the various players differ .
for asean , which includes nations as diverse as tiny trading economy singapore , shunned dictatorship burma and regional giant indonesia , it is vital to get asia 's three powerhouses on side rather than in opposition .
for india , asean is playing an increasingly important economic role , with trade up 25 % in the past year to about $ 12.5bn.

the local bank official in the indian state of rajasthan , where the old man lives , is visiting to present him with his monthly pension .
habib miyan has been drawing his pension since his retirement in 1938 - his pension papers document his age as 125 , although he claims to be older .
but this time he has asked for a bit more than his 1,900 rupee -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- pension to be drawn from his account .
he has asked for extra money to pay for purchases as part of preparations to make his first hajj pilgrimage to mecca this december .
benefactor habib miyan is able to make the journey thanks to a uk-based businessman , who is funding his trip after reading about him on bbc news online .
mr khan , the 30-year-old company chairman from london , transferred 270,000 rupees -lrb- $ 5,700 -rrb- to help pay for the pilgrimage .
habib miyan rajesh nagpal is the bank official who has been visiting habib miyan for the past several years and handles his account .
" mr khan and i exchanged several e-mails to determine how much money should be wired to us , " he says .
" i got in touch with the local hajj committee to work out the costs for habib miyan and three of his family members to go along with him , and we arrived at the figure of 270,000 rupees . "
habib miyan , who has now lost his eyesight , will be accompanied by two grandsons , mehmood and chuttan khan , and their mother munni bewa .
dream comes true the family of 32 live in a narrow , three-storey house in a muslim neighbourhood in jaipur , the rajasthani capital .
animals scavenge through rubbish , and open drains line the narrow lane outside their house .
" ours is a poor neighbourhood and it 's impossible for anyone here to go on the hajj because of the enormous expenses involved , " explains chuttan khan .
" i feel very , very privileged .
going to the hajj is the ultimate dream come true . "
in a dark inner room , habib miyan holds court .
he keeps the neighbours , who drop in several times a day to seek his counsel , entertained with stories of ancient times .
" his memory is so sharp , " says one of them .
" he tells us stories of kings and queens , of heroes and of their loves . "
but bring him back to the present and the lucidity starts to fade .
" in my youth , we had no telephones , no way to communicate the way you do , " he says , slowly , as he tries to comprehend the sequence of events that brought him into contact with his benefactor .
" i suppose mr khan read about us in a newspaper - in which the bbc told him about my condition and my wish . "
getting ready but he brightens up as his grandson brings him a new prayer cap to try on .
" very nice , " he mutters as he feels it with his fingers .
" we need to buy caps , clothes , even provisions such as wheat and lentils for our journey , " explains chuttan khan .
" these things cost a lot more in saudi arabia , so we 'll try and take as much as we can . "
the preparations for the trip are well under way .
a sum of 10,550 rupees -lrb- $ 230 -rrb- has been deposited with the hajj committee , which will make all the arrangements to fly the pilgrims to mecca .
" we 've got the notification from the committee saying we 're booked to go , " says mr khan , beaming .
it 's late evening and the neighbours slink away , leaving an old man to his prayers .
he says one for a stranger thousands of miles away who has made his wish come true .
" you have allowed me to meet allah and i pray that he looks over you .
" may he grant you a life longer than mine . "
khan is an assumed name for the businessman for the purpose of this article only .

jjb said discussions were still at a relatively early stage , following a review of the group 's non-core businesses .
tj hughes - which was bought by jjb for £ 42m only last year - sells clothes , homeware and small electrical goods and is based mainly in the north west of england .
jjb also announced a fall in half-year profits to £ 24.2m , from £ 32.8m in the same period last year .
like-for-like sales - which strip out the effects of new store openings - fell 3 % at its core sports stores compared with 2002 .
jjb said this was due to fierce competition in the market and also because 2002 's figures were boosted by sales of football shirts during last year 's world cup .
price-fixing fine in august , jjb was fined £ 8.3m by the office of fair trading following an investigation into price-fixing of replica shirts .
jjb was one of 10 firms to be fined , with manchester united and umbro also being penalised .
the company has appealed against the decision , and has said it is confident it can get the decision overturned .
" no provision has been made in respect of this fine on the financial accounts as , on the basis of advice received , the board believes that the appeal will be successful , " jjb said .

morgan parry , from world wildlife fund cymru , says while the assembly is doing well working with other provincial governments on sustainable issues , it is not doing enough at home .
if things like energy conservation and waste management were actually happening in unison - instead of " little bits here and there and not particularly joined up , we could really begin to make a difference and wales could become world leaders " .
however , environment minister carwyn jones said it would take time for people in wales to take sustainability seriously .
mr parry 's criticisms follow a new academic report " living differently " commissioned by wwf cymru which recommends that welsh councils which do not improve their environmental and social policies should have funding withheld .
the report outlines two main obstacles to the assembly 's plans for a more environmentally-friendly wales .
the assembly needs to start delivering on its promises morgan parry , wwf cymru one reason is a lack of commitment from local authorities , while another is the failure of public bodies like the welsh development agency to embrace the principles in their work .
mr parry told bbc wales that there was " open hostility at senior levels of the welsh development agency " to sustainable development .
" it 's a real challenge for the wda to recognise that this is the way forward .
" there are good projects that the wda is funding around wales , but corporately they have not bought into this agenda at all , " he said .
sustainability was " an attitude of mind " which mr parry said he believed " did not exist in enough senior places and public authorities in wales .

today , as dr mahathir prepares to step down from power , malaysia boasts a diversified and modern economy , which weathered the asian financial crisis of 1997-98 better than many of its peers .
mahathir 's farewell the consensus is that it will achieve growth of 5.4 % next year , outshining almost every country in south east asia , with the exception of thailand .
" malaysia 's success has been in diversifying away from -lsb- the export -rsb- of palm oil and rubber to the assembly of electronics , " says anne booth , professor of economics at the school of oriental and african studies -lrb- soas -rrb- in london .
" the transition over the last 20 years has been impressive and you have to give credit to mahathir for that . "
unpredictable malaysia 's long-standing leader , seen by some outsiders as half-rational , half-quixotic , has exercised tight control over the country 's purse strings . "
he is complex figure - at times , his rants have been off-putting for investors " graham richardson eiu he has provided political stability and papered over ethnic divisions , " says graham richardson , regional director for asia at the economist intelligence unit -lrb- eiu -rrb- .
" but he is a complex figure .
at times , his rants have been off-putting for investors . "
famously , dr mahathir denounced the financier george soros for sparking the asian financial crisis , which dealt a mortal blow to malaysia 's 1990s boom .
then , controversially , he moved to insulate the economy by imposing short-term capital controls to prevent foreign money from leaving the country .
in hindsight , his policy seems to have paid off , as malaysia bounced back from a steep contraction in gdp in 1998 .
the country 's dependence on trade meant that the global economic slowdown inevitably took its toll in 2001 , but government spending has helped it to ride out the storm .
however , this level of public sector spending - contributing 3.5 % to the 4.8 % growth achieved by malaysia in 1999-02 , according to investment bank hsbc - could become problematic .
tax incentives and generous terms for public sector employees have helped to boost domestic demand , but have also contributed to a budget deficit equal to 5 % of gdp .
soas ' anne booth says that mahathir 's successor - the deputy prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi - " might want to rein in budget spending " .
although , the country does not have excessive amounts of public debt , such spending is unsustainable in the long-term .
threat from china by pumping up domestic demand , the government has also counteracted a worrying decline in foreign direct investment .
this has fallen from 6.4 % of gdp in 1990-96 to 1.2 % in 2000-02 , according to hsbc data .
much of this can be attributed to the rising dominance of china as a destination for low-tech manufacturing .
lower costs in china mean that foreign companies are already beginning to transfer their manufacturing away from malaysia , says the eiu 's graham richardson .
the threat of china and its ability to provide a vast domestic market for foreign companies will force malaysia to discover new niches in the electronics market , adds ms booth .
already , the government has turned its attention to its service industries , such as healthcare and tourism .
it is developing a hybrid of the two with its " health tourism " , which offers foreigners cheap operations and four-star recuperation in the country 's many hotels .
" it is an attempt by the government to buttress against volatile external demand , " says vasan shridharan , senior regional economist at hsbc in singapore .
eastern promise in the 2004 budget last month , the government also unveiled measures to boost the sluggish private sector with tax breaks for small- and medium-sized companies .
but , as mr shridharan points out , china also presents opportunities for malaysia - exports to the country have jumped by 43 % annually in the last two years , compared to a 0.6 % increase in malaysia 's overall exports . "
-lsb- badawi -rsb- is not a one-man band like mahathir " anne booth soas malaysian unemployment has also remained fairly steady at about 3.5 % , despite the falls in foreign investment .
dr mahathir 's keen stewardship of the economy has spawned various projects - the latest of which is a " knowledge-based economy master plan " to upgrade malaysia 's electronics industry from low to hi-tech .
in the past few years , he has even acted as his own finance minister .
by contrast , mr badawi is expected to strengthen the financial team .
" i have the impression that that 's his style , he 's not a one-man band like mahathir , " says ms booth .
as malaysia enters a new phase of economic development , mr badawi will need to call upon his cabinet to neutralise the threat from china and steer the economy in yet another direction .

today , as dr mahathir prepares to step down from power , malaysia boasts a diversified and modern economy , which weathered the asian financial crisis of 1997-98 better than many of its peers .
mahathir 's farewell put your questions to the malaysian pm the consensus is that it will achieve growth of 5.4 % next year , outshining almost every country in south east asia , with the exception of thailand .
" malaysia 's success has been in diversifying away from -lsb- the export -rsb- of palm oil and rubber to the assembly of electronics , " says anne booth , professor of economics at the school of oriental and african studies -lrb- soas -rrb- in london .
" the transition over the last 20 years has been impressive and you have to give credit to mahathir for that . "
unpredictable malaysia 's long-standing leader , seen by some outsiders as half-rational , half-quixotic , has exercised tight control over the country 's purse strings .
he is complex figure - at times , his rants have been off-putting for investors graham richardson eiu he has provided political stability and papered over ethnic divisions , " says graham richardson , regional director for asia at the economist intelligence unit -lrb- eiu -rrb- .
" but he is a complex figure .
at times , his rants have been off-putting for investors . "
famously , dr mahathir denounced the financier george soros for sparking the asian financial crisis , which dealt a mortal blow to malaysia 's 1990s boom .
then , controversially , he moved to insulate the economy by imposing short-term capital controls to prevent foreign money from leaving the country .
in hindsight , his policy seems to have paid off , as malaysia bounced back from a steep contraction in gdp in 1998 .
the country 's dependence on trade meant that the global economic slowdown inevitably took its toll in 2001 , but government spending has helped it to ride out the storm .
however , this level of public sector spending - contributing 3.5 % to the 4.8 % growth achieved by malaysia in 1999-02 , according to investment bank hsbc - could become problematic .
tax incentives and generous terms for public sector employees have helped to boost domestic demand , but have also contributed to a budget deficit equal to 5 % of gdp .
soas ' anne booth says that mahathir 's successor - the deputy prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi - " might want to rein in budget spending " .
although , the country does not have excessive amounts of public debt , such spending is unsustainable in the long-term .
threat from china by pumping up domestic demand , the government has also counteracted a worrying decline in foreign direct investment .
this has fallen from 6.4 % of gdp in 1990-96 to 1.2 % in 2000-02 , according to hsbc data .
much of this can be attributed to the rising dominance of china as a destination for low-tech manufacturing .
the economy in 2002 lower costs in china mean that foreign companies are already beginning to transfer their manufacturing away from malaysia , says the eiu 's graham richardson .
the threat of china and its ability to provide a vast domestic market for foreign companies will force malaysia to discover new niches in the electronics market , adds ms booth .
already , the government has turned its attention to its service industries , such as healthcare and tourism .
it is developing a hybrid of the two with its " health tourism " , which offers foreigners cheap operations and four-star recuperation in the country 's many hotels .
" it is an attempt by the government to buttress against volatile external demand , " says vasan shridharan , senior regional economist at hsbc in singapore .
eastern promise in the 2004 budget last month , the government also unveiled measures to boost the sluggish private sector with tax breaks for small- and medium-sized companies .
but , as mr shridharan points out , china also presents opportunities for malaysia - exports to the country have jumped by 43 % annually in the last two years , compared to a 0.6 % increase in malaysia 's overall exports .
-lsb- badawi -rsb- is not a one-man band like mahathir anne booth soas malaysian unemployment has also remained fairly steady at about 3.5 % , despite the falls in foreign investment .
dr mahathir 's keen stewardship of the economy has spawned various projects - the latest of which is a " knowledge-based economy master plan " to upgrade malaysia 's electronics industry from low to hi-tech .
in the past few years , he has even acted as his own finance minister .
by contrast , mr badawi is expected to strengthen the financial team .

cash and insurance based accounts target lower risk investors while stock market linked accounts are for those who are prepared to take more risk .

the government has pledged to keep this limit until april 2006 , after which it is set to fall to £ 5,000 .
national savings and investments national savings and investments , the government-backed institution , offers a range of tax-free investments .

you can find a range of tax-free savings including , mini cash isas , premium bonds , index linked and fixed interest savings certificates , as well as children 's bonus bonds .
friendly societies these organisations have a special tax status .
they offer insurance-based investments , which tend to be with-profits funds - and unit-linked funds , which are effectively collective share investments .

individuals can invest a maximum £ 270 a year or £ 25 per month tax-free .

stakeholder pensions , although they have n't proved very popular with their target market of low or non-earners , are in principle a good product offering flexibility and tax benefits .

a financial adviser outlines some options which are available to savers .
we all want to get the most out of our savings and investments and tax free , or tax efficient investments , certainly help .
there are various forms of tax-free investing , ranging from simple deposit based products for cautious investors , to more complicated products for more experienced investors who are willing to take some risks with their capital .
individual savings accounts -lrb- isas -rrb- individual savings accounts -lrb- isas -rrb- were designed by the government to encourage people to save money .
they were introduced in april 1999 - replacing two previous products - tax exempt special savings plans -lrb- tessas -rrb- and personal equity plans -lrb- peps -rrb- - and were designed to cater for all types of investors .
isas have done a relatively good job catering for a range of people with different appetites for risk justine fearns find out more about individual savings accounts investors have a choice of two different types of isas - maxis and minis - depending on where they want to put their money , but they can not take out both a maxi and a mini isa in the same tax year .
cash and insurance based accounts target lower risk investors while stock market linked accounts are for those who are prepared to take more risk .
in the current tax year , you can invest up to £ 7,000 in an isa .
the government has pledged to keep this limit until april 2006 , after which it is set to fall to £ 5,000 .
national savings and investments national savings and investments , the government-backed institution , offers a range of tax-free investments .
although the rates may not always be top of the class , they can be a useful addition to the other allowances available to us .
you can find a range of tax-free savings including , mini cash isas , premium bonds , index linked and fixed interest savings certificates , as well as children 's bonus bonds .
friendly societies these organisations have a special tax status .
they offer insurance-based investments , which tend to be with-profits funds - and unit-linked funds , which are effectively collective share investments .
you can invest in these investments through something known as a tax exempt savings account .
individuals can invest a maximum £ 270 a year or £ 25 per month tax-free .
pensions everyone can get tax relief on pension savings .
you do not need to be a taxpayer for the inland revenue to provide £ 28 of every £ 100 you put into an approved pension .
stakeholder pensions ... are in principle a good product offering flexibility and tax benefits even non-earning spouses and children can benefit whilst higher rate tax payers stand to gain even more .
on retirement , or between the ages of 50 and at the latest 75 , you can take up to 25 % of your pension fund as tax-free cash , the balance is used to provide an income for life that will be taxed at your usual rate .
stakeholder pensions are personal pensions that restrict charges to a maximum of 1 % a year and have a low minimum contribution level of £ 20 per month .
they also offer complete flexibility to stop and start contributions or to transfer without a charge or penalty being imposed .
venture capital trusts venture capital trusts -lrb- vcts -rrb- and enterprise investment schemes offer tax benefits covering both income and capital gains tax .
they are aimed at people with lots of capital to spare .
for example , with a vct , income tax relief is available at 20 % on the first £ 100,000 invested during the tax year in which the investment is made -lrb- providing the investment is held for at least three years -rrb- .
private investors will not be liable to income tax on dividends either .
in addition , capital gains tax may be deferred through investment into a vct , subject to very specific rules .
vcts are high risk investments into smaller unquoted companies and are not suitable for all investors .
round-up the majority of these products have been government initiatives to encourage people to save .
isas have done a relatively good job catering for a range of people with different appetites for risk and with different amounts to invest .
stakeholder pensions , although they have n't proved very popular with their target market of low or non-earners , are in principle a good product offering flexibility and tax benefits .

the man was seen coming out of a squash club while he was on sick leave but the rail maritime and transport union -lrb- rmt -rrb- said he has medical proof saying sporting activity was part of his recovery programme .
rmt members who work on the hammersmith and city line , used by 55,000 people a day , will be involved in the ballot and are being urged to support strikes in protest at the dismissal of the train driver .
general secretary bob crow accused the company of " scraping the barrel " in finding an excuse to sack the activist .
" the company has wasted public money snooping to catch the driver coming out of his squash club while off sick with an ankle injury , " he said .
" yet the driver concerned has produced evidence that both his gp and sports injury therapist advised him that an increasing amount of exercise would speed his recovery and therefore his return to work . "
an lu spokesman said the union has launched an appeal against the dismissal but said it was " disappointed that the rmt has called this ballot when the disciplinary process is not yet exhausted . "

spears won a restraining order to keep masahiko shizawa , 41 , a distance of at least 300 yards -lrb- 274 metres -rrb- .
despite sending hundreds of letters and photos to her home , he denied stalking her and said he was just an avid fan .
but superior court judge alan haber said there was an " obvious pattern of harassment and emotional harm done " .
spears , 21 , sought a restraining order against the man in december 2002 , saying he tried to contact her at two of her homes and that of her parents .
he also allegedly sent photos of himself and notes saying " i 'm chasing you " .
' in love ' mr shizawa returned to japan when his visa expired in december but wanted to resolve the issue so he could eventually return to the united states .
his lawyer had argued that mr shizawa , a computer programmer and inventor , was harmless and the confusion arose from a cultural misunderstanding .
simon robert hiller said his client was a law-abiding citizen but was " in love " with spears .
meanwhile , the wife of the governor of maryland , kendel ehrlich , has said her comments about wanting to shoot pop star spears were an " inadvertent figure of speech " .
shooting comment mrs ehrilch , wife of governor robert ehrlich , had been speaking at a conference on domestic violence when she spoke of the negative image she felt spears put across in her raunchy act .
encouraging children to stay on at school , she said : " it is incredibly important to get that message to young women .
you know , really , if i had an opportunity to shoot britney spears , i think i would . "
she added : " oh my goodness , what would i do if i had a daughter who is seeing these images and having peer pressure ? "
spears ' label jive records said : " since this unfortunate comment was made at a domestic violence prevention conference , it seems that mrs ehrlich has shot her own self in the foot by promoting violence . "
as spokesman for mrs ehrilch later said : " the first lady is a working mother raising a young son .
she made an inadvertent figure of speech expressing her concerns about the influence of pop culture on children . "

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- cox leaves radio 1 breakfast home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment arts & culture also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : wednesday , 8 october , 2003 , 08:48 gmt 09:48 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version cox leaves radio 1 breakfast moyles will swap shows with cox in january bbc radio 1 dj sara cox is to be replaced as host of the station 's breakfast show by chris moyles .
the move comes after months of speculation that cox was to be replaced following falling audiences .
cox will replace moyles as the host of the afternoon show of the bbc 's flagship pop music station .
" i am absolutely delighted that chris has agreed to host the new breakfast show , " said radio 1 controller andy parfitt on tuesday .
mr parfitt said moyles was his " only choice " as a replacement , adding that cox had done a " great job " over the last three and a half years .
" in a market that is getting more competitive by the month , i think chris is going to be just what our audience is looking for , " he said .
sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible bbc spokesman her successor profiled moyles said : " i am really chuffed - i 've said for ages that i am the saviour of radio 1 , now it looks i am finally going to have the chance to prove it ! "
cox said she had " a great time " doing the show - but the prospect of a lie-in was " extremely appealing " .
two months ago it was revealed that the breakfast show had lost 433,000 listeners in the space of a month , although it was still drawing an audience of 6.6 million .
at the time the bbc denied reports that cox was facing being dropped because of falling audience figures .
it described as " nonsense " a newspaper story suggesting she would be sacked if listener figures did not improve in the next 10 weeks , insisting radio 1 would keep cox on the show until the end of her contract in april .
a radio 1 spokesman told bbc news online on tuesday : " sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible .
" sara will remain at radio 1 on our drivetime show , and she remains a vital part of the radio 1 line-up . "
moyles has deputised for cox and her predecessor , zoe ball , on the breakfast show since he joined radio 1 in 1997 .
rising stars colin murray and edith bowman have also recently appeared on the show as stand-ins .
ball , who is now drivetime dj on london rock station xfm , said she was looking forward to some " friendly rivalry " with cox in her new time slot .
" she may be one of my best friends but if she thinks she 's going to be taking any of my xfm listeners , she can think again , " she said .
what do you think of the decision ?
please see below for a selection of your comments .
the reason that there is a lot of ' moyles negative ' statements on here is that a majority of people find him so annoying to listen to .
if he is the saviour of radio , then i 'd rather switch to tv !
paul smith , uk thank god - sara cox is the most irritating dj ever .
moyles is very good in the afternoon and i would have preferred him to stay there and scott mills to have taken the breakfast slot .
if it was felt that mills was n't up to this he should have been given the drivetime slot and sara cox finished completely .
pete , england trust the bbc to completely mis-understand the talents of their own presenters ! ! ! !
leave moyles where he is .
remember what happened to steve wright !
put colin & edith on in the morning and drop cox completely .
surely that was the way to go .
chris is brilliant in the afternoon and moving him to the morning , in my opinion , is not a wise idea .
colin & edith , however , have proved they have the energy and fun to make a morning show work .
i hope i 'm wrong , but i doubt it !
simon , uk how pleased i was to hear cox was leaving only to be downheartened by hearing she is taking over the afternoon slot .
her voice is like nails scraping down a blackboard .
please retire her before i rip out my radio from my car and throw it out of the window .
rebecca , uk once again the radio 1 bosses have mis-read their audience .
the reason for falling audience figures for the breakfast slot is the weakness of the show format : egos and in-jokes .
answer : bring in an ego who thrives on in-jokes .
at least colin and edith know the music !
simon , uk chris moyles is just soooo awful !
i switched to capital ages ago , despite the annoying advertising .
i like to listen to music on the radio when running in the morning - but not radio one .
scott mills is great and it is a shame he cant be on the breakfast slot .
michelle , uk cox was great .
colin and edith being on was the reason i stopped listening ! steve , uk shame .
i liked sara cox and found her amusing to listen to on my drive to work .
hope she will enjoy her new show and will tune in on my way home .
do n't like chris moyles though so will stick to local radio in the morning .
it is interesting to read all the comments here though !
chris , uk only a couple of these comments refer to the real problem - the music .
surely that 's why we listen to radio in the first place ?
radio one 's playlist is too limited and the same few songs get played to death before they 're even released .
pete , england chris moyles is the best dj .
its refreshing to have someone who is different from the rest .
glad its not scott mills who sounds just like a local radio dj , and colin and edith just talk over each other far too manically like they cant believe they are on radio 1 .
personally , i do n't mind sara .
both her and chris have a unique brand of humour which does n't fit with some people with a staid attitude .
frank , uk chris moyles ?
saviour of radio 1 ?
do n't think so ... his show is stewed , overcooked and basically - boring !
in the beginning his arrogant ramblings were kind of humorous , but as soon as i started preferring scott mills i knew that moyles had had his day .
yes ... you sometimes need a translator to understand sara cox , but at least she never let her own ego get in the way of the music , which often contained some little gems .
jo whiley , mark and lard followed by cox will be a good afternoon line up ... just get rid of dave pearce and send him and the moyles show into the depths of late night programming and radio 1 will be a better place .
this may be controversial but what about ant n dec for breakfast ?
chris , cardiff , wales this is the best news i 've heard all week !
i stopped listening to radio one over a year ago because of sara cox and am thrilled to hear that moyles has been handed the crown so will be returning to the fold one the change has taken place .
i wish chris the best of luck and hope that he does n't tone things down for the new time slot .
lori smith , manchester , uk chris moyles has the humour and spark needed to make the breakfast show a hit for radio 1 , my only grumble is they left sara cox on for so long when she is clearly not suited to breakfast radio .
ian , uk completely gutted !
sara cox made every morning that little bit more bearable - hilarious , down to earth and camper than a row of tents .
with chris moyles at the helm , radio 2 has never been more appealing !
mark , london , uk i think the chris moyles is definitely a backwards step .
a stepback to the 1980s with james whale-style programming .
why is someone whose supposed talent is based on ignorance , abuse and arrogance going to be the saviour of radio 1 ?
i think trusting the anchor for a full day 's scheduling with a character such as this is desperate and narrow-minded , and now is the time for the public to speak up .
raymond murray , uk i do n't think the swap is a good idea , chris moyles is far too fond of the sound of his own voice !
i do n't actually listen to the breakfast show as i think sarah cox does n't play a good mix of music , but i definitely wo n't be listening now .
i think the best man for the job is scott mills , he 's funny and the music is a good mix of everything .
lucie homer , uk i am a big fan of moyles , so i am a little disappointed at the news he is moving to the breakfast show .
i will only be able to listen to him for 15 minutes and imagine he would be annoying at that time of the day - cox certainly is .
however , i wish him the best of luck and i am sure he will raise the ratings .
mark , uk chris moyles is a talentless , unfunny , bitter and twisted dj , so why the bbc would put him on prime is a mystery to me .
i have never met anyone who can bear more than a minute of his obnoxious drivel .
russell b , uk go moylesy !
colin & edith are great too , they might have been my first choice , but anything 's better than sara cox .
the only reason i listen to radio 1 in the mornings at the moment is because i ca n't stand the ads on commercial radio and radio 4 is n't enough to wake me up !
jennie , england i think colin and edith should get the breakfast show and moyles should stay in the afternoon .
they have done a good job standing in and chris moyles seems to suit the afternoon slot .
also , i have more chance of listening to the radio in the pm when moyles is on !
chris , uk personally i think sara cox is wicked on the breakfast show and the reason i do n't currently listen to radio 1 during drive time is because i ca n't stand chris moyles !
maybe the drop in listeners is due to the fact that she has hardly presented during the last few months .
i do n't even listen when she is away !
kate gunn , england i have a choice between radio 1 and local radio on my way to work during breakfast and from work during chris moyles ' show .
moyles is an idiot and colin and edith totally ruin the breakfast show , because all three prefer their own voices to the music .
of chris , sara and colin and edith , only sara is worth listening to and i 'll be sticking to local radio from now on in .
ben taylor , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 mark fry , england thank god they 've seen the light of day and dropped sara cox ! !
it 's just a shame they 've replaced her with the equally annoying chris moyles - why could n't they have put colin and edith in breakfast slot permanently ?
kirsten , leeds , uk sara was the only bright spot in an otherwise increasingly awful programme .
the insultingly moronic " news " -lrb- aka latest bbc festival announcement -rrb- , the boring competitions and phone-ins , the terrible play-list and habit of playing certain songs every single morning for months and months ¿ surely these are the reasons for the drop in numbers .
if chris can change all this then the show might be in with a chance .
fiona , uk thank god sara cox is going .
the woman talks too fast and is n't funny . the move ca n't come to soon .
i think colin & edith would be better than chris moyles .
elaine freeman , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both well past their sell by date .
people do n't want to listen to them any more , that 's why audience figures are falling .
moving the schedules around wo n't change anything .
i tuned out of radio 1 months ago because i was sick of them both .
david , uk i think chris is best suited where he is .
colin and edith have filled in well during cox 's recent absences .
i must admit i have found a local radio station 's breakfast presenter a " better listen " in the mornings recently .
good luck sara , seems the tide has turned against you .
it 's a shame .
dave , uk i 've felt all along that moyles ' style was more suited to a breakfast slot , and would therefore be better than coxy , and finally , a bit too late for some , radio 1 make the switch .
at least this 'll mean coxy will be up against her mate zoe ball on xfm , which should be fun ...
stevie , england i ca n't think of a better bloke to wake up to in the morning ! !
he 'll be great .
sharon , uk no !
i ca n't believe coxy is leaving and i really ca n't believe moyles will take over- two dreadful decisions .
morag , uk i 'm only disappointed they are keeping her at all !
i am one of the many who have stopped listening to the breakfast show although to be fair , it was n't just because of the host , the music sucked too !
yan g , uk this is the biggest mistake radio 1 have ever made .
moving chris , fair enough .
putting cox on in the afternoon , the reason the show was loosing listeners was because of her .
what 's she going to do to the afternoon listening figures ?
oh well guess i 'll be listening to radio 2 all day now .
lee carter , uk i 'll be surprised if moyles manages to turn around the figures based on the fact that he 's the countries most irritating dj .
i 'll be finding a new radio station to listen to in the mornings .
james , uk i wake up to sara everyday and it 's the best start in the morning .
do n't replace her !
bobbi , uk to be honest i have been turning over stations in the morning drive to work once sara came on at 7am .
i will welcome chris moyles taking over but will miss him during my drive home from work .
jon baylis , wigan , uk .
i stopped listening to radio 1 when zoe ball left .
to hear that moyles is taking over is an improvement but still wo n't bring me back .
much prefer our local station heart fm .
kelly , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 , rather than kicked into the " talentless shouty person " bucket where she belongs .
mark fry , england i listen to radio 1 on the way to and from work .
i 'm glad to see that sara cox will no longer being irritating me in the mornings !
it 's just a pity that colin and edith are n't taking over the drive time show .
good luck to chris moyles !
laura , uk what a shame , i am a loyal listener to the moyles show which fits perfectly into the afternoon .
most people i assume that listen to moyles are travelling to work at that time in the morning , or still in bed .
he will be sorely missed at 3pm ! !
sarah , england the afternoon on radio one is the best around at the moment - mark and lard followed by chris moyles .
chris is one of the funniest djs on the radio at the moment and you can understand why bosses want to try him on their primetime slot to boost falling figures .
but will he lose his spark by having to make those early morning shows - especially with his reputation for having and odd drink or two ?
andrew lowe , uk chris is the only choice for the breakfast show , but putting sara in the prime spot in the afternoon may be a mistake .
we 'll just have to wait and see ...
rob spencer , england why on earth is chris moyles taking over the breakfast show ?
he is easily the worst dj on radio 1 , he and his sidekicks spend the entire show spouting nonsense which is no more entertaining than listening to five year old boys .
the last thing i want is to have to listen to that inane rubbish first thing in the morning .
no more radio 1 for me .
alan petrie , scotland what a great move !
chris moyles is brilliant , but why have they moved sara cox to drivetime ?
could they not just replace her with scott mills .
his position at radio 1 does not reflect his level of talent .
ian rawlins , england are you sure this is wise ?
chris moyles has n't done breakfast in years .
he used to be really good , but i remember steve wright being ace in the afternoon and a flop at breakfast ...
never got on with coxy , her voice is like nails down a blackboard - surely mills in the afternoon and letting her go would have been more attractive to the audience ?
dave cartwright , uk radio 1 have missed a serious trick with this move .
why keep someone if no one is listening .
why not give edith and colin the breakfast slot as they have proved to be best thing on radio 1 .
moyles is not funny and the prospect of listening to him first thing in the morning is frightening .
so long radio 1 i fear i will no longer be listening .
mike scruton , england moyles ?
looks like radio 2 for me on the road to work in the new year .
i thought edith and colin would have been a better choice .
andy , scotland i do n't think chris is a good choice for the breakfast slot , because he is to loud and ' in your face ' for that time of the morning .
greg o 'connell , uk bad move , chris is an arse , his show annoys me , his side-kicks are ok but chris ¿ selfish / offensive attitude stinks and is something you can do without first thing in the morning .
i usually switch to a local station in the afternoon , looks like i 'll be doing it in the morning now instead !
daheidsta , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
ian , uk at last !
time to re-tune my radio back to radio 1 .
bye bye coxy .
martin ross , uk chris moyles radio style is completely suited to the afternoon show , colin and edith should have been given the breakfast show .
i do n't see how sara can stay at radio 1 after the negative publicity .
mark smith , u.k from idiot to imbecile .
radio 1 is irrelevant .
techno techno handbag disco .
iain nicholson , uk could be a great swap .
sara often says she has to leave parties early because of her show .
this way we will now get all the gossip .
not much good for her liver though .
steve c , uk i 'm very sorry to hear sara is to be axed - i will be switching off when moyles takes over - if anyone should take over it should be scott mills - at least he has some intelligence .
jeane anderson , uk sara will be sorely missed on the breakfast show , i really enjoyed listening to her over the internet every morning while i was living in germany .
chris moyles is fine for a late afternoon show but i do n't think i could stomach him first thing in the morning !
caroline , uk if any dj on radio 1 can save the breakfast show , then it 's chris moyles .
not that i do n't like sara cox , but there has been a lack lustre to the whole morning show since chris evans left .
i for one will be tuning back in to hear it .
dave pigott , uk i will miss sara in a morning , she makes driving to work so much more enjoyable !
she 's absolutely hilarious and my favourite dj by far .
maybe it 's the northern sense of humour ...
i 'm really glad she 'll still be on radio 1 .
stephanie ainscough , blackpool , england i think radio 1 has made the right decision .
chris is a great presenter at any time of the day , but he now has to prove that he is the " saviour " of radio 1 , and work his magic on the breakfast slot ! !
trace , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
i listen to radio 1 avidly every weekday ; once on my way to work , once on the way home .
mornings were getting very irritating .
i guess now i should face irritating evenings instead .
colin and edith should be present in the new line up , they 're fresh , interesting and less vulgar .
ian , uk it 's bad enough listening to tiresome fart jokes in the afternoon .
who wants to listen to it first thing in the morning ?
moyles is a loud bully who thinks he 's the king of the celebrity social scene , and talks about little more than whatever reality show is currently on tv .
was that recent bbc talent search a failure ?
it would appear so .
angry from redhill , england radio 1 is losing daytime listeners , not because of the dj 's , but because of it 's inane and repetitive playlists that focus on the top 40 and so called popular artists , rather than offering a broad and cosmopolitan mix of music .
nigel , england about time too .
moyles should have got the show when zoe ball left .
i will be switching on to radio 1 in the morning and off during the afternoon .
dave , uk i am glad that radio 1 have dropped sara cox .
i was an avid morning listener before she arrived and am afraid i switched radio stations as i found her appalling .
fiona , uk yay ! about time .
glad to see her go .
bring on colin and edith ! ! ! susan , uk shame on radio one !
sara cox is the reason i started listening to radio 1 in the mornings again .
she is sexy , genuinely witty and well worth the licence fee .
chris moyles is the reason i turn over while driving home for the opposite reasons .
he is a poor man 's chris evans with only a fraction of the talent .
still , my homeward journey will be all the better in the company of ms cox !
karl , leeds , uk leave sara in her job , chris moyles sucks !
silvio , uk great , could n't listen to her from day one .
but i can thank her for pushing me over to radio five live .
try not to let her or moyles near five live .
nigel , england chris moyles is indeed the saviour of radio 1 .
it 's about time the bosses at radio 1 spread the age of the target audience group .
although in the early stages sara was appealing it soon changed to school radio .
for almost half of the days shows the target age group is in school or college and not driving to work finding local radio more appealing .
good luck to chris moyles jarv , uk spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks ryan , uk hooray !
one form of childishness to another !
matthew revell , wolverhampton , uk i think its the best decision that radio 1 have made for some years .
he 's the best on the radio and will be able to put everyone in good step for the rest of the day .
all they need to do now is swap mark and lard around with scott mills to create a super daytime line up !
richard , plymouth , england a long time coming .
well done chris .
see ya cox abs , uk hurrah !
best news ever !
i only ever listen to radio 1 when moyles is filling in because sara cox has had less and less to say over the past two years , now she rambles on in monotone .
sometimes i ca n't even hear what she 's saying because she mumbles so much .
hurrah for chris moyles in the morning to really wake me up !
lindsay , uk yaaaayyyyyy !
at last annoying " cox-ey " is out !
no more dull stories of her celebrity friends & what she did the night before .
i 'm so happy ! andy , uk thank god she 's going , i have always found her annoying .
chris is good and will be much better than sarah - but why not give it to colin & edith ?
when they have been standing in for sarah , they have been great and by far the most enjoyable djs to listen to .
nick , uk radio 1 are replacing one annoying person with another .
neither will make me tune back to the station in the morning .
they need someone who is n't grating first thing in the morning .
paul , uk thank god sara cox is probably the worst radio dj ever .
the only problem is now the drive home is going to be torture .
ca n't they just get rid of her completely darren rees , uk ca n't help but think that it will be like twins presenting the bbc breakfast shows with moyles on radio 1 and jupitus on 6 music chris gullick , newport , south wales not a moment too soon .
i live in south dorset where the commercial alternatives are non-existent and have had to put up with her crass noise for 3 1/2 years .
even this morning she made a comment after returning from a wedding anniversary break stating ' she might be walking funny ' .
how does a parent explain that to their children ?
colin and edith should have been given the slot - their recent breakfast shows have been funny and intelligent .
mark f , uk sometimes , after an undemanding day i can just about cope with moyles , his rants and his ' style ' of bullying his sidekicks .
so no , i wo n't be able to listen at 7am .
have we really got such a dearth of talent in this country that a sexist oaf is the only option ?
lisa , uk it really does n't matter who hosts the breakfast show on this redundant radio station that speaks to no-one about anything .
it has just shown further how out of touch with what people want and need parfitt is by giving the half-wit oaf moyles any further publicity .
the bbc should be ashamed of itself .
at least radio 2 has had the sense to get rid of edmonds after a short but still too long spell on drivetime. kath rice , uk i think chris moyles will be too overpowering first thing in the morning , sara and the team are a great start to the day .
kirsty , uk great choice and well overdue .
i was disappointed that chris moyles did n't take over from zoe ball when she left but now he is getting his chance .
he is a personality and a half , i love listening to his afternoon show over here in the usa and my only regret is that i will miss his new morning show .
lynne akom , usa i think sara cox and chris moyles are , broadly speaking , as talentless as each other .
empty-headed humour and meandering drivel a second time round will surely be the last thing to draw listeners back to radio 1 .
paul tester , uk sara cox is terrible , she just mutters nonsense .
moyles is alright , but i do n't think he 's 7am material .
colin & edith did a great job over the past few weeks - why not offer them it ?
dave , uk at last !
radio 1 has been unlistenable since cox took over the breakfast slot to delight us with her droning tales of ' getting wasted ' .
moyles ai n't exactly enlightenment but at least has enough of a spark of irony to tempt me back from radio 4 !
rich , uk moyles was obviously the first choice and good luck to the fella , my journeys to the office should be a little more bearable now !
spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks while coxy was ' on-leave ? '
keep up the good work you 2 , funny , quick and too good for rise ! !
ryan , uk it 's not just the djs it is more to do with the fact that the playlist clerks pick the most rubbish music to play and it 's all talk talk talk , if you wanted that you would tape newsnight and watch that in the morning - it would be more exciting carl , uk aww cmon , there 's far too many " moyles negative " statements here , however chris is indeed the saviour of ' afternoon ' radio , and should stay there .
matt , uk chris moyles is a talentless moron who seems to believe he 's god 's gift to radio .
he would do better on hospital radio - at least there he 'd have a captive audience .
angela b , uk i will be really sad to see sara go as she has brightened my mornings and made me able to face work with a smile !
i 'm glad that colin and edith are n't going to take over as i find them really boring .
i good luck in your new show sara - i for one will definitely be listening !
ceri h-j , uk i do think cox has lost her touch on the breakfast show and it is time she stepped down , but choosing chris moyles to replace her is not the best move radio 1 have made .
moyles style is not really suited to the morning slot , especially if he starts to shout and rant like he often does in the afternoon .
and his references to life in the ' 80s and early ' 90s would be lost on most of his younger audience .
in the afternoon slot he has a much older adult audience , and they appreciate his style and humour .
unlike the breakfast slot which seems to have a core audience of school kids and young adults on their way to work .
i do n't think they will get what moyles is about most of the time .
bring on colin and edith !
kate , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both as irritating to listen to as each other - jo whiley is the only decent daytime dj and if the breakfast slot is supposedly the most important would n't it make sense to tempt her there ? !
andrea , uk i thought sara cox was pretty good - she used to keep me sane during my monday morning drive along the m4 & round the m25 - and i 'm sure chris will be fine too .
but please get colin & edith off breakfast ! !
they 're the most annoying , predictable , brainless presenters i 've ever heard - they sound like they belong on some local commercial station -lrb- no offence commercial -rrb- .
i listen to radio 1 because it promotes quality , and colin & edith are definitely not .
plus they talk over the end of songs - far too eager to hear their own voices for my liking .
anyway , that 's my rant over ! !
jane , uk i 've really enjoyed waking up to sara in the mornings ¿ she makes me laugh .
i 've listened to the radio 1 breakfast show for over 20 years , but if chris moyles takes over then i 'll move to a different station .
if colin & edith take over , i 'll stay with radio 1 .
gill pitts , england who am i supposed to listen to on the drive home from work now ?
the local radio station in exeter is just about bearable in the morning , and i 've enjoyed chris moyles since he was on the late shift at capital fm .
he was the best antidote for a boring day at work , or a long afternoon drive back up to london for the weekend !
i certainly wo n't be tuning into sara cox 's afternoons - i ca n't stand her !
stephen , uk the difference between the two djs will be obvious when they swap : cox is annoying , uncharismatic and dim-witted , while moyles 's arrogance is only affected and his jokes tongue-in-cheek .
he 's no bully - he 's just having a laugh .
good decision bbc .
stuart , uk i discovered radio 2 because of sara cox and her mind-numbing breakfast show .
i never thought i 'd ever listen to radio 2 before the age of 40 -lrb- i 'm 27 -rrb- , but terry wogan & co do n't play gangsta rap - and therefore do n't try to pretend it 's cool - they do n't irritate me and terry is actually rather funny !
claire , england i have been one of the thousands of listeners to have turned over to another station in the morning .
i would have rather seen colin and edith replace coxy .
they are original and just what is needed for that time of day .
chris moyles should carry on in the afternoon .
why change a good thing ?
coxy seems to have run out of ideas and the bbc are only moving the problem .
chris , united kingdom what a bad , bad decision .
colin and edith , now that would bring me back to radio 1 in the mornings .
debbie sheppard , uk i think they 're both brilliant , so i will still listen to both .
they are the best two on the station by far , although i do like scott mills too .
i hope sara cox does n't get down about being dropped from the breakfast show .
i think she 's absolutely hilarious and very witty , but i suppose some people are a bit prudish and that 's why they may have stopped listening .
they ought to get real cos she tells it like it is !
big up to sara !

the move comes after months of speculation that cox was to be replaced following falling audiences .
cox will replace moyles as the host of the afternoon show of the bbc 's flagship pop music station .
" i am absolutely delighted that chris has agreed to host the new breakfast show , " said radio 1 controller andy parfitt on tuesday .
mr parfitt said moyles was his " only choice " as a replacement , adding that cox had done a " great job " over the last three and a half years .
" in a market that is getting more competitive by the month , i think chris is going to be just what our audience is looking for , " he said .
sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible bbc spokesman her successor profiled moyles said : " i am really chuffed - i 've said for ages that i am the saviour of radio 1 , now it looks i am finally going to have the chance to prove it ! "
cox said she had " a great time " doing the show - but the prospect of a lie-in was " extremely appealing " .
two months ago it was revealed that the breakfast show had lost 433,000 listeners in the space of a month , although it was still drawing an audience of 6.6 million .
at the time the bbc denied reports that cox was facing being dropped because of falling audience figures .
it described as " nonsense " a newspaper story suggesting she would be sacked if listener figures did not improve in the next 10 weeks , insisting radio 1 would keep cox on the show until the end of her contract in april .
a radio 1 spokesman told bbc news online on tuesday : " sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible .
" sara will remain at radio 1 on our drivetime show , and she remains a vital part of the radio 1 line-up . "
moyles has deputised for cox and her predecessor , zoe ball , on the breakfast show since he joined radio 1 in 1997 .
rising stars colin murray and edith bowman have also recently appeared on the show as stand-ins .
ball , who is now drivetime dj on london rock station xfm , said she was looking forward to some " friendly rivalry " with cox in her new time slot .
" she may be one of my best friends but if she thinks she 's going to be taking any of my xfm listeners , she can think again , " she said .
what do you think of the decision ?
please see below for a selection of your comments .
the reason that there is a lot of ' moyles negative ' statements on here is that a majority of people find him so annoying to listen to .
if he is the saviour of radio , then i 'd rather switch to tv !
paul smith , uk thank god - sara cox is the most irritating dj ever .
moyles is very good in the afternoon and i would have preferred him to stay there and scott mills to have taken the breakfast slot .
if it was felt that mills was n't up to this he should have been given the drivetime slot and sara cox finished completely .
pete , england trust the bbc to completely mis-understand the talents of their own presenters ! ! ! !
leave moyles where he is .
remember what happened to steve wright !
put colin & edith on in the morning and drop cox completely .
surely that was the way to go .
chris is brilliant in the afternoon and moving him to the morning , in my opinion , is not a wise idea .
colin & edith , however , have proved they have the energy and fun to make a morning show work .
i hope i 'm wrong , but i doubt it !
simon , uk how pleased i was to hear cox was leaving only to be downheartened by hearing she is taking over the afternoon slot .
her voice is like nails scraping down a blackboard .
please retire her before i rip out my radio from my car and throw it out of the window .
rebecca , uk once again the radio 1 bosses have mis-read their audience .
the reason for falling audience figures for the breakfast slot is the weakness of the show format : egos and in-jokes .
answer : bring in an ego who thrives on in-jokes .
at least colin and edith know the music !
simon , uk chris moyles is just soooo awful !
i switched to capital ages ago , despite the annoying advertising .
i like to listen to music on the radio when running in the morning - but not radio one .
scott mills is great and it is a shame he cant be on the breakfast slot .
michelle , uk cox was great .
colin and edith being on was the reason i stopped listening ! steve , uk shame .
i liked sara cox and found her amusing to listen to on my drive to work .
hope she will enjoy her new show and will tune in on my way home .
do n't like chris moyles though so will stick to local radio in the morning .
it is interesting to read all the comments here though !
chris , uk only a couple of these comments refer to the real problem - the music .
surely that 's why we listen to radio in the first place ?
radio one 's playlist is too limited and the same few songs get played to death before they 're even released .
pete , england chris moyles is the best dj .
its refreshing to have someone who is different from the rest .
glad its not scott mills who sounds just like a local radio dj , and colin and edith just talk over each other far too manically like they cant believe they are on radio 1 .
personally , i do n't mind sara .
both her and chris have a unique brand of humour which does n't fit with some people with a staid attitude .
frank , uk chris moyles ?
saviour of radio 1 ?
do n't think so ... his show is stewed , overcooked and basically - boring !
in the beginning his arrogant ramblings were kind of humorous , but as soon as i started preferring scott mills i knew that moyles had had his day .
yes ... you sometimes need a translator to understand sara cox , but at least she never let her own ego get in the way of the music , which often contained some little gems .
jo whiley , mark and lard followed by cox will be a good afternoon line up ... just get rid of dave pearce and send him and the moyles show into the depths of late night programming and radio 1 will be a better place .
this may be controversial but what about ant n dec for breakfast ?
chris , cardiff , wales this is the best news i 've heard all week !
i stopped listening to radio one over a year ago because of sara cox and am thrilled to hear that moyles has been handed the crown so will be returning to the fold one the change has taken place .
i wish chris the best of luck and hope that he does n't tone things down for the new time slot .
lori smith , manchester , uk chris moyles has the humour and spark needed to make the breakfast show a hit for radio 1 , my only grumble is they left sara cox on for so long when she is clearly not suited to breakfast radio .
ian , uk completely gutted !
sara cox made every morning that little bit more bearable - hilarious , down to earth and camper than a row of tents .
with chris moyles at the helm , radio 2 has never been more appealing !
mark , london , uk i think the chris moyles is definitely a backwards step .
a stepback to the 1980s with james whale-style programming .
why is someone whose supposed talent is based on ignorance , abuse and arrogance going to be the saviour of radio 1 ?
i think trusting the anchor for a full day 's scheduling with a character such as this is desperate and narrow-minded , and now is the time for the public to speak up .
raymond murray , uk i do n't think the swap is a good idea , chris moyles is far too fond of the sound of his own voice !
i do n't actually listen to the breakfast show as i think sarah cox does n't play a good mix of music , but i definitely wo n't be listening now .
i think the best man for the job is scott mills , he 's funny and the music is a good mix of everything .
lucie homer , uk i am a big fan of moyles , so i am a little disappointed at the news he is moving to the breakfast show .
i will only be able to listen to him for 15 minutes and imagine he would be annoying at that time of the day - cox certainly is .
however , i wish him the best of luck and i am sure he will raise the ratings .
mark , uk chris moyles is a talentless , unfunny , bitter and twisted dj , so why the bbc would put him on prime is a mystery to me .
i have never met anyone who can bear more than a minute of his obnoxious drivel .
russell b , uk go moylesy !
colin & edith are great too , they might have been my first choice , but anything 's better than sara cox .
the only reason i listen to radio 1 in the mornings at the moment is because i ca n't stand the ads on commercial radio and radio 4 is n't enough to wake me up !
jennie , england i think colin and edith should get the breakfast show and moyles should stay in the afternoon .
they have done a good job standing in and chris moyles seems to suit the afternoon slot .
also , i have more chance of listening to the radio in the pm when moyles is on !
chris , uk personally i think sara cox is wicked on the breakfast show and the reason i do n't currently listen to radio 1 during drive time is because i ca n't stand chris moyles !
maybe the drop in listeners is due to the fact that she has hardly presented during the last few months .
i do n't even listen when she is away !
kate gunn , england i have a choice between radio 1 and local radio on my way to work during breakfast and from work during chris moyles ' show .
moyles is an idiot and colin and edith totally ruin the breakfast show , because all three prefer their own voices to the music .
of chris , sara and colin and edith , only sara is worth listening to and i 'll be sticking to local radio from now on in .
ben taylor , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 mark fry , england thank god they 've seen the light of day and dropped sara cox ! !
it 's just a shame they 've replaced her with the equally annoying chris moyles - why could n't they have put colin and edith in breakfast slot permanently ?
kirsten , leeds , uk sara was the only bright spot in an otherwise increasingly awful programme .
the insultingly moronic " news " -lrb- aka latest bbc festival announcement -rrb- , the boring competitions and phone-ins , the terrible play-list and habit of playing certain songs every single morning for months and months ¿ surely these are the reasons for the drop in numbers .
if chris can change all this then the show might be in with a chance .
fiona , uk thank god sara cox is going .
the woman talks too fast and is n't funny . the move ca n't come to soon .
i think colin & edith would be better than chris moyles .
elaine freeman , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both well past their sell by date .
people do n't want to listen to them any more , that 's why audience figures are falling .
moving the schedules around wo n't change anything .
i tuned out of radio 1 months ago because i was sick of them both .
david , uk i think chris is best suited where he is .
colin and edith have filled in well during cox 's recent absences .
i must admit i have found a local radio station 's breakfast presenter a " better listen " in the mornings recently .
good luck sara , seems the tide has turned against you .
it 's a shame .
dave , uk i 've felt all along that moyles ' style was more suited to a breakfast slot , and would therefore be better than coxy , and finally , a bit too late for some , radio 1 make the switch .
at least this 'll mean coxy will be up against her mate zoe ball on xfm , which should be fun ...
stevie , england i ca n't think of a better bloke to wake up to in the morning ! !
he 'll be great .
sharon , uk no !
i ca n't believe coxy is leaving and i really ca n't believe moyles will take over- two dreadful decisions .
morag , uk i 'm only disappointed they are keeping her at all !
i am one of the many who have stopped listening to the breakfast show although to be fair , it was n't just because of the host , the music sucked too !
yan g , uk this is the biggest mistake radio 1 have ever made .
moving chris , fair enough .
putting cox on in the afternoon , the reason the show was loosing listeners was because of her .
what 's she going to do to the afternoon listening figures ?
oh well guess i 'll be listening to radio 2 all day now .
lee carter , uk i 'll be surprised if moyles manages to turn around the figures based on the fact that he 's the countries most irritating dj .
i 'll be finding a new radio station to listen to in the mornings .
james , uk i wake up to sara everyday and it 's the best start in the morning .
do n't replace her !
bobbi , uk to be honest i have been turning over stations in the morning drive to work once sara came on at 7am .
i will welcome chris moyles taking over but will miss him during my drive home from work .
jon baylis , wigan , uk .
i stopped listening to radio 1 when zoe ball left .
to hear that moyles is taking over is an improvement but still wo n't bring me back .
much prefer our local station heart fm .
kelly , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 , rather than kicked into the " talentless shouty person " bucket where she belongs .
mark fry , england i listen to radio 1 on the way to and from work .
i 'm glad to see that sara cox will no longer being irritating me in the mornings !
it 's just a pity that colin and edith are n't taking over the drive time show .
good luck to chris moyles !
laura , uk what a shame , i am a loyal listener to the moyles show which fits perfectly into the afternoon .
most people i assume that listen to moyles are travelling to work at that time in the morning , or still in bed .
he will be sorely missed at 3pm ! !
sarah , england the afternoon on radio one is the best around at the moment - mark and lard followed by chris moyles .
chris is one of the funniest djs on the radio at the moment and you can understand why bosses want to try him on their primetime slot to boost falling figures .
but will he lose his spark by having to make those early morning shows - especially with his reputation for having and odd drink or two ?
andrew lowe , uk chris is the only choice for the breakfast show , but putting sara in the prime spot in the afternoon may be a mistake .
we 'll just have to wait and see ...
rob spencer , england why on earth is chris moyles taking over the breakfast show ?
he is easily the worst dj on radio 1 , he and his sidekicks spend the entire show spouting nonsense which is no more entertaining than listening to five year old boys .
the last thing i want is to have to listen to that inane rubbish first thing in the morning .
no more radio 1 for me .
alan petrie , scotland what a great move !
chris moyles is brilliant , but why have they moved sara cox to drivetime ?
could they not just replace her with scott mills .
his position at radio 1 does not reflect his level of talent .
ian rawlins , england are you sure this is wise ?
chris moyles has n't done breakfast in years .
he used to be really good , but i remember steve wright being ace in the afternoon and a flop at breakfast ...
never got on with coxy , her voice is like nails down a blackboard - surely mills in the afternoon and letting her go would have been more attractive to the audience ?
dave cartwright , uk radio 1 have missed a serious trick with this move .
why keep someone if no one is listening .
why not give edith and colin the breakfast slot as they have proved to be best thing on radio 1 .
moyles is not funny and the prospect of listening to him first thing in the morning is frightening .
so long radio 1 i fear i will no longer be listening .
mike scruton , england moyles ?
looks like radio 2 for me on the road to work in the new year .
i thought edith and colin would have been a better choice .
andy , scotland i do n't think chris is a good choice for the breakfast slot , because he is to loud and ' in your face ' for that time of the morning .
greg o 'connell , uk bad move , chris is an arse , his show annoys me , his side-kicks are ok but chris ¿ selfish / offensive attitude stinks and is something you can do without first thing in the morning .
i usually switch to a local station in the afternoon , looks like i 'll be doing it in the morning now instead !
daheidsta , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
ian , uk at last !
time to re-tune my radio back to radio 1 .
bye bye coxy .
martin ross , uk chris moyles radio style is completely suited to the afternoon show , colin and edith should have been given the breakfast show .
i do n't see how sara can stay at radio 1 after the negative publicity .
mark smith , u.k from idiot to imbecile .
radio 1 is irrelevant .
techno techno handbag disco .
iain nicholson , uk could be a great swap .
sara often says she has to leave parties early because of her show .
this way we will now get all the gossip .
not much good for her liver though .
steve c , uk i 'm very sorry to hear sara is to be axed - i will be switching off when moyles takes over - if anyone should take over it should be scott mills - at least he has some intelligence .
jeane anderson , uk sara will be sorely missed on the breakfast show , i really enjoyed listening to her over the internet every morning while i was living in germany .
chris moyles is fine for a late afternoon show but i do n't think i could stomach him first thing in the morning !
caroline , uk if any dj on radio 1 can save the breakfast show , then it 's chris moyles .
not that i do n't like sara cox , but there has been a lack lustre to the whole morning show since chris evans left .
i for one will be tuning back in to hear it .
dave pigott , uk i will miss sara in a morning , she makes driving to work so much more enjoyable !
she 's absolutely hilarious and my favourite dj by far .
maybe it 's the northern sense of humour ...
i 'm really glad she 'll still be on radio 1 .
stephanie ainscough , blackpool , england i think radio 1 has made the right decision .
chris is a great presenter at any time of the day , but he now has to prove that he is the " saviour " of radio 1 , and work his magic on the breakfast slot ! !
trace , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
i listen to radio 1 avidly every weekday ; once on my way to work , once on the way home .
mornings were getting very irritating .
i guess now i should face irritating evenings instead .
colin and edith should be present in the new line up , they 're fresh , interesting and less vulgar .
ian , uk it 's bad enough listening to tiresome fart jokes in the afternoon .
who wants to listen to it first thing in the morning ?
moyles is a loud bully who thinks he 's the king of the celebrity social scene , and talks about little more than whatever reality show is currently on tv .
was that recent bbc talent search a failure ?
it would appear so .
angry from redhill , england radio 1 is losing daytime listeners , not because of the dj 's , but because of it 's inane and repetitive playlists that focus on the top 40 and so called popular artists , rather than offering a broad and cosmopolitan mix of music .
nigel , england about time too .
moyles should have got the show when zoe ball left .
i will be switching on to radio 1 in the morning and off during the afternoon .
dave , uk i am glad that radio 1 have dropped sara cox .
i was an avid morning listener before she arrived and am afraid i switched radio stations as i found her appalling .
fiona , uk yay ! about time .
glad to see her go .
bring on colin and edith ! ! ! susan , uk shame on radio one !
sara cox is the reason i started listening to radio 1 in the mornings again .
she is sexy , genuinely witty and well worth the licence fee .
chris moyles is the reason i turn over while driving home for the opposite reasons .
he is a poor man 's chris evans with only a fraction of the talent .
still , my homeward journey will be all the better in the company of ms cox !
karl , leeds , uk leave sara in her job , chris moyles sucks !
silvio , uk great , could n't listen to her from day one .
but i can thank her for pushing me over to radio five live .
try not to let her or moyles near five live .
nigel , england chris moyles is indeed the saviour of radio 1 .
it 's about time the bosses at radio 1 spread the age of the target audience group .
although in the early stages sara was appealing it soon changed to school radio .
for almost half of the days shows the target age group is in school or college and not driving to work finding local radio more appealing .
good luck to chris moyles jarv , uk spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks ryan , uk hooray !
one form of childishness to another !
matthew revell , wolverhampton , uk i think its the best decision that radio 1 have made for some years .
he 's the best on the radio and will be able to put everyone in good step for the rest of the day .
all they need to do now is swap mark and lard around with scott mills to create a super daytime line up !
richard , plymouth , england a long time coming .
well done chris .
see ya cox abs , uk hurrah !
best news ever !
i only ever listen to radio 1 when moyles is filling in because sara cox has had less and less to say over the past two years , now she rambles on in monotone .
sometimes i ca n't even hear what she 's saying because she mumbles so much .
hurrah for chris moyles in the morning to really wake me up !
lindsay , uk yaaaayyyyyy !
at last annoying " cox-ey " is out !
no more dull stories of her celebrity friends & what she did the night before .
i 'm so happy ! andy , uk thank god she 's going , i have always found her annoying .
chris is good and will be much better than sarah - but why not give it to colin & edith ?
when they have been standing in for sarah , they have been great and by far the most enjoyable djs to listen to .
nick , uk radio 1 are replacing one annoying person with another .
neither will make me tune back to the station in the morning .
they need someone who is n't grating first thing in the morning .
paul , uk thank god sara cox is probably the worst radio dj ever .
the only problem is now the drive home is going to be torture .
ca n't they just get rid of her completely darren rees , uk ca n't help but think that it will be like twins presenting the bbc breakfast shows with moyles on radio 1 and jupitus on 6 music chris gullick , newport , south wales not a moment too soon .
i live in south dorset where the commercial alternatives are non-existent and have had to put up with her crass noise for 3 1/2 years .
even this morning she made a comment after returning from a wedding anniversary break stating ' she might be walking funny ' .
how does a parent explain that to their children ?
colin and edith should have been given the slot - their recent breakfast shows have been funny and intelligent .
mark f , uk sometimes , after an undemanding day i can just about cope with moyles , his rants and his ' style ' of bullying his sidekicks .
so no , i wo n't be able to listen at 7am .
have we really got such a dearth of talent in this country that a sexist oaf is the only option ?
lisa , uk it really does n't matter who hosts the breakfast show on this redundant radio station that speaks to no-one about anything .
it has just shown further how out of touch with what people want and need parfitt is by giving the half-wit oaf moyles any further publicity .
the bbc should be ashamed of itself .
at least radio 2 has had the sense to get rid of edmonds after a short but still too long spell on drivetime. kath rice , uk i think chris moyles will be too overpowering first thing in the morning , sara and the team are a great start to the day .
kirsty , uk great choice and well overdue .
i was disappointed that chris moyles did n't take over from zoe ball when she left but now he is getting his chance .
he is a personality and a half , i love listening to his afternoon show over here in the usa and my only regret is that i will miss his new morning show .
lynne akom , usa i think sara cox and chris moyles are , broadly speaking , as talentless as each other .
empty-headed humour and meandering drivel a second time round will surely be the last thing to draw listeners back to radio 1 .
paul tester , uk sara cox is terrible , she just mutters nonsense .
moyles is alright , but i do n't think he 's 7am material .
colin & edith did a great job over the past few weeks - why not offer them it ?
dave , uk at last !
radio 1 has been unlistenable since cox took over the breakfast slot to delight us with her droning tales of ' getting wasted ' .
moyles ai n't exactly enlightenment but at least has enough of a spark of irony to tempt me back from radio 4 !
rich , uk moyles was obviously the first choice and good luck to the fella , my journeys to the office should be a little more bearable now !
spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks while coxy was ' on-leave ? '
keep up the good work you 2 , funny , quick and too good for rise ! !
ryan , uk it 's not just the djs it is more to do with the fact that the playlist clerks pick the most rubbish music to play and it 's all talk talk talk , if you wanted that you would tape newsnight and watch that in the morning - it would be more exciting carl , uk aww cmon , there 's far too many " moyles negative " statements here , however chris is indeed the saviour of ' afternoon ' radio , and should stay there .
matt , uk chris moyles is a talentless moron who seems to believe he 's god 's gift to radio .
he would do better on hospital radio - at least there he 'd have a captive audience .
angela b , uk i will be really sad to see sara go as she has brightened my mornings and made me able to face work with a smile !
i 'm glad that colin and edith are n't going to take over as i find them really boring .
i good luck in your new show sara - i for one will definitely be listening !
ceri h-j , uk i do think cox has lost her touch on the breakfast show and it is time she stepped down , but choosing chris moyles to replace her is not the best move radio 1 have made .
moyles style is not really suited to the morning slot , especially if he starts to shout and rant like he often does in the afternoon .
and his references to life in the ' 80s and early ' 90s would be lost on most of his younger audience .
in the afternoon slot he has a much older adult audience , and they appreciate his style and humour .
unlike the breakfast slot which seems to have a core audience of school kids and young adults on their way to work .
i do n't think they will get what moyles is about most of the time .
bring on colin and edith !
kate , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both as irritating to listen to as each other - jo whiley is the only decent daytime dj and if the breakfast slot is supposedly the most important would n't it make sense to tempt her there ? !
andrea , uk i thought sara cox was pretty good - she used to keep me sane during my monday morning drive along the m4 & round the m25 - and i 'm sure chris will be fine too .
but please get colin & edith off breakfast ! !
they 're the most annoying , predictable , brainless presenters i 've ever heard - they sound like they belong on some local commercial station -lrb- no offence commercial -rrb- .
i listen to radio 1 because it promotes quality , and colin & edith are definitely not .
plus they talk over the end of songs - far too eager to hear their own voices for my liking .
anyway , that 's my rant over ! !
jane , uk i 've really enjoyed waking up to sara in the mornings ¿ she makes me laugh .
i 've listened to the radio 1 breakfast show for over 20 years , but if chris moyles takes over then i 'll move to a different station .
if colin & edith take over , i 'll stay with radio 1 .
gill pitts , england who am i supposed to listen to on the drive home from work now ?
the local radio station in exeter is just about bearable in the morning , and i 've enjoyed chris moyles since he was on the late shift at capital fm .
he was the best antidote for a boring day at work , or a long afternoon drive back up to london for the weekend !
i certainly wo n't be tuning into sara cox 's afternoons - i ca n't stand her !
stephen , uk the difference between the two djs will be obvious when they swap : cox is annoying , uncharismatic and dim-witted , while moyles 's arrogance is only affected and his jokes tongue-in-cheek .
he 's no bully - he 's just having a laugh .
good decision bbc .
stuart , uk i discovered radio 2 because of sara cox and her mind-numbing breakfast show .
i never thought i 'd ever listen to radio 2 before the age of 40 -lrb- i 'm 27 -rrb- , but terry wogan & co do n't play gangsta rap - and therefore do n't try to pretend it 's cool - they do n't irritate me and terry is actually rather funny !
claire , england i have been one of the thousands of listeners to have turned over to another station in the morning .
i would have rather seen colin and edith replace coxy .
they are original and just what is needed for that time of day .
chris moyles should carry on in the afternoon .
why change a good thing ?
coxy seems to have run out of ideas and the bbc are only moving the problem .
chris , united kingdom what a bad , bad decision .
colin and edith , now that would bring me back to radio 1 in the mornings .
debbie sheppard , uk i think they 're both brilliant , so i will still listen to both .
they are the best two on the station by far , although i do like scott mills too .
i hope sara cox does n't get down about being dropped from the breakfast show .
i think she 's absolutely hilarious and very witty , but i suppose some people are a bit prudish and that 's why they may have stopped listening .
they ought to get real cos she tells it like it is !
big up to sara !

the move comes after months of speculation that cox was to be replaced following falling audiences .
cox will replace moyles as the host of the afternoon show of the bbc 's flagship pop music station .
" i am absolutely delighted that chris has agreed to host the new breakfast show , " said radio 1 controller andy parfitt on tuesday .
mr parfitt said moyles was his " only choice " as a replacement , adding that cox had done a " great job " over the last three and a half years .
" in a market that is getting more competitive by the month , i think chris is going to be just what our audience is looking for , " he said .
sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible bbc spokesman her successor profiled moyles said : " i am really chuffed - i 've said for ages that i am the saviour of radio 1 , now it looks i am finally going to have the chance to prove it ! "
cox said she had " a great time " doing the show - but the prospect of a lie-in was " extremely appealing " .
two months ago it was revealed that the breakfast show had lost 433,000 listeners in the space of a month , although it was still drawing an audience of 6.6 million .
at the time the bbc denied reports that cox was facing being dropped because of falling audience figures .
it described as " nonsense " a newspaper story suggesting she would be sacked if listener figures did not improve in the next 10 weeks , insisting radio 1 would keep cox on the show until the end of her contract in april .
a radio 1 spokesman told bbc news online on tuesday : " sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible .
" sara will remain at radio 1 on our drivetime show , and she remains a vital part of the radio 1 line-up . "
moyles has deputised for cox and her predecessor , zoe ball , on the breakfast show since he joined radio 1 in 1997 .
rising stars colin murray and edith bowman have also recently appeared on the show as stand-ins .
ball , who is now drivetime dj on london rock station xfm , said she was looking forward to some " friendly rivalry " with cox in her new time slot .
" she may be one of my best friends but if she thinks she 's going to be taking any of my xfm listeners , she can think again , " she said .
what do you think of the decision ?
please see below for a selection of your comments .
the reason that there is a lot of ' moyles negative ' statements on here is that a majority of people find him so annoying to listen to .
if he is the saviour of radio , then i 'd rather switch to tv !
paul smith , uk thank god - sara cox is the most irritating dj ever .
moyles is very good in the afternoon and i would have preferred him to stay there and scott mills to have taken the breakfast slot .
if it was felt that mills was n't up to this he should have been given the drivetime slot and sara cox finished completely .
pete , england trust the bbc to completely mis-understand the talents of their own presenters ! ! ! !
leave moyles where he is .
remember what happened to steve wright !
put colin & edith on in the morning and drop cox completely .
surely that was the way to go .
chris is brilliant in the afternoon and moving him to the morning , in my opinion , is not a wise idea .
colin & edith , however , have proved they have the energy and fun to make a morning show work .
i hope i 'm wrong , but i doubt it !
simon , uk how pleased i was to hear cox was leaving only to be downheartened by hearing she is taking over the afternoon slot .
her voice is like nails scraping down a blackboard .
please retire her before i rip out my radio from my car and throw it out of the window .
rebecca , uk once again the radio 1 bosses have mis-read their audience .
the reason for falling audience figures for the breakfast slot is the weakness of the show format : egos and in-jokes .
answer : bring in an ego who thrives on in-jokes .
at least colin and edith know the music !
simon , uk chris moyles is just soooo awful !
i switched to capital ages ago , despite the annoying advertising .
i like to listen to music on the radio when running in the morning - but not radio one .
scott mills is great and it is a shame he cant be on the breakfast slot .
michelle , uk cox was great .
colin and edith being on was the reason i stopped listening ! steve , uk shame .
i liked sara cox and found her amusing to listen to on my drive to work .
hope she will enjoy her new show and will tune in on my way home .
do n't like chris moyles though so will stick to local radio in the morning .
it is interesting to read all the comments here though !
chris , uk only a couple of these comments refer to the real problem - the music .
surely that 's why we listen to radio in the first place ?
radio one 's playlist is too limited and the same few songs get played to death before they 're even released .
pete , england chris moyles is the best dj .
its refreshing to have someone who is different from the rest .
glad its not scott mills who sounds just like a local radio dj , and colin and edith just talk over each other far too manically like they cant believe they are on radio 1 .
personally , i do n't mind sara .
both her and chris have a unique brand of humour which does n't fit with some people with a staid attitude .
frank , uk chris moyles ?
saviour of radio 1 ?
do n't think so ... his show is stewed , overcooked and basically - boring !
in the beginning his arrogant ramblings were kind of humorous , but as soon as i started preferring scott mills i knew that moyles had had his day .
yes ... you sometimes need a translator to understand sara cox , but at least she never let her own ego get in the way of the music , which often contained some little gems .
jo whiley , mark and lard followed by cox will be a good afternoon line up ... just get rid of dave pearce and send him and the moyles show into the depths of late night programming and radio 1 will be a better place .
this may be controversial but what about ant n dec for breakfast ?
chris , cardiff , wales this is the best news i 've heard all week !
i stopped listening to radio one over a year ago because of sara cox and am thrilled to hear that moyles has been handed the crown so will be returning to the fold one the change has taken place .
i wish chris the best of luck and hope that he does n't tone things down for the new time slot .
lori smith , manchester , uk chris moyles has the humour and spark needed to make the breakfast show a hit for radio 1 , my only grumble is they left sara cox on for so long when she is clearly not suited to breakfast radio .
ian , uk completely gutted !
sara cox made every morning that little bit more bearable - hilarious , down to earth and camper than a row of tents .
with chris moyles at the helm , radio 2 has never been more appealing !
mark , london , uk i think the chris moyles is definitely a backwards step .
a stepback to the 1980s with james whale-style programming .
why is someone whose supposed talent is based on ignorance , abuse and arrogance going to be the saviour of radio 1 ?
i think trusting the anchor for a full day 's scheduling with a character such as this is desperate and narrow-minded , and now is the time for the public to speak up .
raymond murray , uk i do n't think the swap is a good idea , chris moyles is far too fond of the sound of his own voice !
i do n't actually listen to the breakfast show as i think sarah cox does n't play a good mix of music , but i definitely wo n't be listening now .
i think the best man for the job is scott mills , he 's funny and the music is a good mix of everything .
lucie homer , uk i am a big fan of moyles , so i am a little disappointed at the news he is moving to the breakfast show .
i will only be able to listen to him for 15 minutes and imagine he would be annoying at that time of the day - cox certainly is .
however , i wish him the best of luck and i am sure he will raise the ratings .
mark , uk chris moyles is a talentless , unfunny , bitter and twisted dj , so why the bbc would put him on prime is a mystery to me .
i have never met anyone who can bear more than a minute of his obnoxious drivel .
russell b , uk go moylesy !
colin & edith are great too , they might have been my first choice , but anything 's better than sara cox .
the only reason i listen to radio 1 in the mornings at the moment is because i ca n't stand the ads on commercial radio and radio 4 is n't enough to wake me up !
jennie , england i think colin and edith should get the breakfast show and moyles should stay in the afternoon .
they have done a good job standing in and chris moyles seems to suit the afternoon slot .
also , i have more chance of listening to the radio in the pm when moyles is on !
chris , uk personally i think sara cox is wicked on the breakfast show and the reason i do n't currently listen to radio 1 during drive time is because i ca n't stand chris moyles !
maybe the drop in listeners is due to the fact that she has hardly presented during the last few months .
i do n't even listen when she is away !
kate gunn , england i have a choice between radio 1 and local radio on my way to work during breakfast and from work during chris moyles ' show .
moyles is an idiot and colin and edith totally ruin the breakfast show , because all three prefer their own voices to the music .
of chris , sara and colin and edith , only sara is worth listening to and i 'll be sticking to local radio from now on in .
ben taylor , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 mark fry , england thank god they 've seen the light of day and dropped sara cox ! !
it 's just a shame they 've replaced her with the equally annoying chris moyles - why could n't they have put colin and edith in breakfast slot permanently ?
kirsten , leeds , uk sara was the only bright spot in an otherwise increasingly awful programme .
the insultingly moronic " news " -lrb- aka latest bbc festival announcement -rrb- , the boring competitions and phone-ins , the terrible play-list and habit of playing certain songs every single morning for months and months ¿ surely these are the reasons for the drop in numbers .
if chris can change all this then the show might be in with a chance .
fiona , uk thank god sara cox is going .
the woman talks too fast and is n't funny . the move ca n't come to soon .
i think colin & edith would be better than chris moyles .
elaine freeman , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both well past their sell by date .
people do n't want to listen to them any more , that 's why audience figures are falling .
moving the schedules around wo n't change anything .
i tuned out of radio 1 months ago because i was sick of them both .
david , uk i think chris is best suited where he is .
colin and edith have filled in well during cox 's recent absences .
i must admit i have found a local radio station 's breakfast presenter a " better listen " in the mornings recently .
good luck sara , seems the tide has turned against you .
it 's a shame .
dave , uk i 've felt all along that moyles ' style was more suited to a breakfast slot , and would therefore be better than coxy , and finally , a bit too late for some , radio 1 make the switch .
at least this 'll mean coxy will be up against her mate zoe ball on xfm , which should be fun ...
stevie , england i ca n't think of a better bloke to wake up to in the morning ! !
he 'll be great .
sharon , uk no !
i ca n't believe coxy is leaving and i really ca n't believe moyles will take over- two dreadful decisions .
morag , uk i 'm only disappointed they are keeping her at all !
i am one of the many who have stopped listening to the breakfast show although to be fair , it was n't just because of the host , the music sucked too !
yan g , uk this is the biggest mistake radio 1 have ever made .
moving chris , fair enough .
putting cox on in the afternoon , the reason the show was loosing listeners was because of her .
what 's she going to do to the afternoon listening figures ?
oh well guess i 'll be listening to radio 2 all day now .
lee carter , uk i 'll be surprised if moyles manages to turn around the figures based on the fact that he 's the countries most irritating dj .
i 'll be finding a new radio station to listen to in the mornings .
james , uk i wake up to sara everyday and it 's the best start in the morning .
do n't replace her !
bobbi , uk to be honest i have been turning over stations in the morning drive to work once sara came on at 7am .
i will welcome chris moyles taking over but will miss him during my drive home from work .
jon baylis , wigan , uk .
i stopped listening to radio 1 when zoe ball left .
to hear that moyles is taking over is an improvement but still wo n't bring me back .
much prefer our local station heart fm .
kelly , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 , rather than kicked into the " talentless shouty person " bucket where she belongs .
mark fry , england i listen to radio 1 on the way to and from work .
i 'm glad to see that sara cox will no longer being irritating me in the mornings !
it 's just a pity that colin and edith are n't taking over the drive time show .
good luck to chris moyles !
laura , uk what a shame , i am a loyal listener to the moyles show which fits perfectly into the afternoon .
most people i assume that listen to moyles are travelling to work at that time in the morning , or still in bed .
he will be sorely missed at 3pm ! !
sarah , england the afternoon on radio one is the best around at the moment - mark and lard followed by chris moyles .
chris is one of the funniest djs on the radio at the moment and you can understand why bosses want to try him on their primetime slot to boost falling figures .
but will he lose his spark by having to make those early morning shows - especially with his reputation for having and odd drink or two ?
andrew lowe , uk chris is the only choice for the breakfast show , but putting sara in the prime spot in the afternoon may be a mistake .
we 'll just have to wait and see ...
rob spencer , england why on earth is chris moyles taking over the breakfast show ?
he is easily the worst dj on radio 1 , he and his sidekicks spend the entire show spouting nonsense which is no more entertaining than listening to five year old boys .
the last thing i want is to have to listen to that inane rubbish first thing in the morning .
no more radio 1 for me .
alan petrie , scotland what a great move !
chris moyles is brilliant , but why have they moved sara cox to drivetime ?
could they not just replace her with scott mills .
his position at radio 1 does not reflect his level of talent .
ian rawlins , england are you sure this is wise ?
chris moyles has n't done breakfast in years .
he used to be really good , but i remember steve wright being ace in the afternoon and a flop at breakfast ...
never got on with coxy , her voice is like nails down a blackboard - surely mills in the afternoon and letting her go would have been more attractive to the audience ?
dave cartwright , uk radio 1 have missed a serious trick with this move .
why keep someone if no one is listening .
why not give edith and colin the breakfast slot as they have proved to be best thing on radio 1 .
moyles is not funny and the prospect of listening to him first thing in the morning is frightening .
so long radio 1 i fear i will no longer be listening .
mike scruton , england moyles ?
looks like radio 2 for me on the road to work in the new year .
i thought edith and colin would have been a better choice .
andy , scotland i do n't think chris is a good choice for the breakfast slot , because he is to loud and ' in your face ' for that time of the morning .
greg o 'connell , uk bad move , chris is an arse , his show annoys me , his side-kicks are ok but chris ¿ selfish / offensive attitude stinks and is something you can do without first thing in the morning .
i usually switch to a local station in the afternoon , looks like i 'll be doing it in the morning now instead !
daheidsta , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
ian , uk at last !
time to re-tune my radio back to radio 1 .
bye bye coxy .
martin ross , uk chris moyles radio style is completely suited to the afternoon show , colin and edith should have been given the breakfast show .
i do n't see how sara can stay at radio 1 after the negative publicity .
mark smith , u.k from idiot to imbecile .
radio 1 is irrelevant .
techno techno handbag disco .
iain nicholson , uk could be a great swap .
sara often says she has to leave parties early because of her show .
this way we will now get all the gossip .
not much good for her liver though .
steve c , uk i 'm very sorry to hear sara is to be axed - i will be switching off when moyles takes over - if anyone should take over it should be scott mills - at least he has some intelligence .
jeane anderson , uk sara will be sorely missed on the breakfast show , i really enjoyed listening to her over the internet every morning while i was living in germany .
chris moyles is fine for a late afternoon show but i do n't think i could stomach him first thing in the morning !
caroline , uk if any dj on radio 1 can save the breakfast show , then it 's chris moyles .
not that i do n't like sara cox , but there has been a lack lustre to the whole morning show since chris evans left .
i for one will be tuning back in to hear it .
dave pigott , uk i will miss sara in a morning , she makes driving to work so much more enjoyable !
she 's absolutely hilarious and my favourite dj by far .
maybe it 's the northern sense of humour ...
i 'm really glad she 'll still be on radio 1 .
stephanie ainscough , blackpool , england i think radio 1 has made the right decision .
chris is a great presenter at any time of the day , but he now has to prove that he is the " saviour " of radio 1 , and work his magic on the breakfast slot ! !
trace , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
i listen to radio 1 avidly every weekday ; once on my way to work , once on the way home .
mornings were getting very irritating .
i guess now i should face irritating evenings instead .
colin and edith should be present in the new line up , they 're fresh , interesting and less vulgar .
ian , uk it 's bad enough listening to tiresome fart jokes in the afternoon .
who wants to listen to it first thing in the morning ?
moyles is a loud bully who thinks he 's the king of the celebrity social scene , and talks about little more than whatever reality show is currently on tv .
was that recent bbc talent search a failure ?
it would appear so .
angry from redhill , england radio 1 is losing daytime listeners , not because of the dj 's , but because of it 's inane and repetitive playlists that focus on the top 40 and so called popular artists , rather than offering a broad and cosmopolitan mix of music .
nigel , england about time too .
moyles should have got the show when zoe ball left .
i will be switching on to radio 1 in the morning and off during the afternoon .
dave , uk i am glad that radio 1 have dropped sara cox .
i was an avid morning listener before she arrived and am afraid i switched radio stations as i found her appalling .
fiona , uk yay ! about time .
glad to see her go .
bring on colin and edith ! ! ! susan , uk shame on radio one !
sara cox is the reason i started listening to radio 1 in the mornings again .
she is sexy , genuinely witty and well worth the licence fee .
chris moyles is the reason i turn over while driving home for the opposite reasons .
he is a poor man 's chris evans with only a fraction of the talent .
still , my homeward journey will be all the better in the company of ms cox !
karl , leeds , uk leave sara in her job , chris moyles sucks !
silvio , uk great , could n't listen to her from day one .
but i can thank her for pushing me over to radio five live .
try not to let her or moyles near five live .
nigel , england chris moyles is indeed the saviour of radio 1 .
it 's about time the bosses at radio 1 spread the age of the target audience group .
although in the early stages sara was appealing it soon changed to school radio .
for almost half of the days shows the target age group is in school or college and not driving to work finding local radio more appealing .
good luck to chris moyles jarv , uk spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks ryan , uk hooray !
one form of childishness to another !
matthew revell , wolverhampton , uk i think its the best decision that radio 1 have made for some years .
he 's the best on the radio and will be able to put everyone in good step for the rest of the day .
all they need to do now is swap mark and lard around with scott mills to create a super daytime line up !
richard , plymouth , england a long time coming .
well done chris .
see ya cox abs , uk hurrah !
best news ever !
i only ever listen to radio 1 when moyles is filling in because sara cox has had less and less to say over the past two years , now she rambles on in monotone .
sometimes i ca n't even hear what she 's saying because she mumbles so much .
hurrah for chris moyles in the morning to really wake me up !
lindsay , uk yaaaayyyyyy !
at last annoying " cox-ey " is out !
no more dull stories of her celebrity friends & what she did the night before .
i 'm so happy ! andy , uk thank god she 's going , i have always found her annoying .
chris is good and will be much better than sarah - but why not give it to colin & edith ?
when they have been standing in for sarah , they have been great and by far the most enjoyable djs to listen to .
nick , uk radio 1 are replacing one annoying person with another .
neither will make me tune back to the station in the morning .
they need someone who is n't grating first thing in the morning .
paul , uk thank god sara cox is probably the worst radio dj ever .
the only problem is now the drive home is going to be torture .
ca n't they just get rid of her completely darren rees , uk ca n't help but think that it will be like twins presenting the bbc breakfast shows with moyles on radio 1 and jupitus on 6 music chris gullick , newport , south wales not a moment too soon .
i live in south dorset where the commercial alternatives are non-existent and have had to put up with her crass noise for 3 1/2 years .
even this morning she made a comment after returning from a wedding anniversary break stating ' she might be walking funny ' .
how does a parent explain that to their children ?
colin and edith should have been given the slot - their recent breakfast shows have been funny and intelligent .
mark f , uk sometimes , after an undemanding day i can just about cope with moyles , his rants and his ' style ' of bullying his sidekicks .
so no , i wo n't be able to listen at 7am .
have we really got such a dearth of talent in this country that a sexist oaf is the only option ?
lisa , uk it really does n't matter who hosts the breakfast show on this redundant radio station that speaks to no-one about anything .
it has just shown further how out of touch with what people want and need parfitt is by giving the half-wit oaf moyles any further publicity .
the bbc should be ashamed of itself .
at least radio 2 has had the sense to get rid of edmonds after a short but still too long spell on drivetime. kath rice , uk i think chris moyles will be too overpowering first thing in the morning , sara and the team are a great start to the day .
kirsty , uk great choice and well overdue .
i was disappointed that chris moyles did n't take over from zoe ball when she left but now he is getting his chance .
he is a personality and a half , i love listening to his afternoon show over here in the usa and my only regret is that i will miss his new morning show .
lynne akom , usa i think sara cox and chris moyles are , broadly speaking , as talentless as each other .
empty-headed humour and meandering drivel a second time round will surely be the last thing to draw listeners back to radio 1 .
paul tester , uk sara cox is terrible , she just mutters nonsense .
moyles is alright , but i do n't think he 's 7am material .
colin & edith did a great job over the past few weeks - why not offer them it ?
dave , uk at last !
radio 1 has been unlistenable since cox took over the breakfast slot to delight us with her droning tales of ' getting wasted ' .
moyles ai n't exactly enlightenment but at least has enough of a spark of irony to tempt me back from radio 4 !
rich , uk moyles was obviously the first choice and good luck to the fella , my journeys to the office should be a little more bearable now !
spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks while coxy was ' on-leave ? '
keep up the good work you 2 , funny , quick and too good for rise ! !
ryan , uk it 's not just the djs it is more to do with the fact that the playlist clerks pick the most rubbish music to play and it 's all talk talk talk , if you wanted that you would tape newsnight and watch that in the morning - it would be more exciting carl , uk aww cmon , there 's far too many " moyles negative " statements here , however chris is indeed the saviour of ' afternoon ' radio , and should stay there .
matt , uk chris moyles is a talentless moron who seems to believe he 's god 's gift to radio .
he would do better on hospital radio - at least there he 'd have a captive audience .
angela b , uk i will be really sad to see sara go as she has brightened my mornings and made me able to face work with a smile !
i 'm glad that colin and edith are n't going to take over as i find them really boring .
i good luck in your new show sara - i for one will definitely be listening !
ceri h-j , uk i do think cox has lost her touch on the breakfast show and it is time she stepped down , but choosing chris moyles to replace her is not the best move radio 1 have made .
moyles style is not really suited to the morning slot , especially if he starts to shout and rant like he often does in the afternoon .
and his references to life in the ' 80s and early ' 90s would be lost on most of his younger audience .
in the afternoon slot he has a much older adult audience , and they appreciate his style and humour .
unlike the breakfast slot which seems to have a core audience of school kids and young adults on their way to work .
i do n't think they will get what moyles is about most of the time .
bring on colin and edith !
kate , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both as irritating to listen to as each other - jo whiley is the only decent daytime dj and if the breakfast slot is supposedly the most important would n't it make sense to tempt her there ? !
andrea , uk i thought sara cox was pretty good - she used to keep me sane during my monday morning drive along the m4 & round the m25 - and i 'm sure chris will be fine too .
but please get colin & edith off breakfast ! !
they 're the most annoying , predictable , brainless presenters i 've ever heard - they sound like they belong on some local commercial station -lrb- no offence commercial -rrb- .
i listen to radio 1 because it promotes quality , and colin & edith are definitely not .
plus they talk over the end of songs - far too eager to hear their own voices for my liking .
anyway , that 's my rant over ! !
jane , uk i 've really enjoyed waking up to sara in the mornings ¿ she makes me laugh .
i 've listened to the radio 1 breakfast show for over 20 years , but if chris moyles takes over then i 'll move to a different station .
if colin & edith take over , i 'll stay with radio 1 .
gill pitts , england who am i supposed to listen to on the drive home from work now ?
the local radio station in exeter is just about bearable in the morning , and i 've enjoyed chris moyles since he was on the late shift at capital fm .
he was the best antidote for a boring day at work , or a long afternoon drive back up to london for the weekend !
i certainly wo n't be tuning into sara cox 's afternoons - i ca n't stand her !
stephen , uk the difference between the two djs will be obvious when they swap : cox is annoying , uncharismatic and dim-witted , while moyles 's arrogance is only affected and his jokes tongue-in-cheek .
he 's no bully - he 's just having a laugh .
good decision bbc .
stuart , uk i discovered radio 2 because of sara cox and her mind-numbing breakfast show .
i never thought i 'd ever listen to radio 2 before the age of 40 -lrb- i 'm 27 -rrb- , but terry wogan & co do n't play gangsta rap - and therefore do n't try to pretend it 's cool - they do n't irritate me and terry is actually rather funny !
claire , england i have been one of the thousands of listeners to have turned over to another station in the morning .
i would have rather seen colin and edith replace coxy .
they are original and just what is needed for that time of day .
chris moyles should carry on in the afternoon .
why change a good thing ?
coxy seems to have run out of ideas and the bbc are only moving the problem .
chris , united kingdom what a bad , bad decision .
colin and edith , now that would bring me back to radio 1 in the mornings .
debbie sheppard , uk i think they 're both brilliant , so i will still listen to both .
they are the best two on the station by far , although i do like scott mills too .
i hope sara cox does n't get down about being dropped from the breakfast show .
i think she 's absolutely hilarious and very witty , but i suppose some people are a bit prudish and that 's why they may have stopped listening .
they ought to get real cos she tells it like it is !
big up to sara !

the move comes after months of speculation that cox was to be replaced following falling audiences .
cox will replace moyles as the host of the afternoon show of the bbc 's flagship pop music station .
" i am absolutely delighted that chris has agreed to host the new breakfast show , " said radio 1 controller andy parfitt on tuesday .
mr parfitt said moyles was his " only choice " as a replacement , adding that cox had done a " great job " over the last three and a half years .
" in a market that is getting more competitive by the month , i think chris is going to be just what our audience is looking for , " he said .
sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible bbc spokesman her successor profiled moyles said : " i am really chuffed - i 've said for ages that i am the saviour of radio 1 , now it looks i am finally going to have the chance to prove it ! "
cox said she had " a great time " doing the show - but the prospect of a lie-in was " extremely appealing " .
two months ago it was revealed that the breakfast show had lost 433,000 listeners in the space of a month , although it was still drawing an audience of 6.6 million .
at the time the bbc denied reports that cox was facing being dropped because of falling audience figures .
it described as " nonsense " a newspaper story suggesting she would be sacked if listener figures did not improve in the next 10 weeks , insisting radio 1 would keep cox on the show until the end of her contract in april .
a radio 1 spokesman told bbc news online on tuesday : " sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible .
" sara will remain at radio 1 on our drivetime show , and she remains a vital part of the radio 1 line-up . "
moyles has deputised for cox and her predecessor , zoe ball , on the breakfast show since he joined radio 1 in 1997 .
rising stars colin murray and edith bowman have also recently appeared on the show as stand-ins .
ball , who is now drivetime dj on london rock station xfm , said she was looking forward to some " friendly rivalry " with cox in her new time slot .
" she may be one of my best friends but if she thinks she 's going to be taking any of my xfm listeners , she can think again , " she said .
what do you think of the decision ?
please see below for a selection of your comments .
the reason that there is a lot of ' moyles negative ' statements on here is that a majority of people find him so annoying to listen to .
if he is the saviour of radio , then i 'd rather switch to tv !
paul smith , uk thank god - sara cox is the most irritating dj ever .
moyles is very good in the afternoon and i would have preferred him to stay there and scott mills to have taken the breakfast slot .
if it was felt that mills was n't up to this he should have been given the drivetime slot and sara cox finished completely .
pete , england trust the bbc to completely mis-understand the talents of their own presenters ! ! ! !
leave moyles where he is .
remember what happened to steve wright !
put colin & edith on in the morning and drop cox completely .
surely that was the way to go .
chris is brilliant in the afternoon and moving him to the morning , in my opinion , is not a wise idea .
colin & edith , however , have proved they have the energy and fun to make a morning show work .
i hope i 'm wrong , but i doubt it !
simon , uk how pleased i was to hear cox was leaving only to be downheartened by hearing she is taking over the afternoon slot .
her voice is like nails scraping down a blackboard .
please retire her before i rip out my radio from my car and throw it out of the window .
rebecca , uk once again the radio 1 bosses have mis-read their audience .
the reason for falling audience figures for the breakfast slot is the weakness of the show format : egos and in-jokes .
answer : bring in an ego who thrives on in-jokes .
at least colin and edith know the music !
simon , uk chris moyles is just soooo awful !
i switched to capital ages ago , despite the annoying advertising .
i like to listen to music on the radio when running in the morning - but not radio one .
scott mills is great and it is a shame he cant be on the breakfast slot .
michelle , uk cox was great .
colin and edith being on was the reason i stopped listening ! steve , uk shame .
i liked sara cox and found her amusing to listen to on my drive to work .
hope she will enjoy her new show and will tune in on my way home .
do n't like chris moyles though so will stick to local radio in the morning .
it is interesting to read all the comments here though !
chris , uk only a couple of these comments refer to the real problem - the music .
surely that 's why we listen to radio in the first place ?
radio one 's playlist is too limited and the same few songs get played to death before they 're even released .
pete , england chris moyles is the best dj .
its refreshing to have someone who is different from the rest .
glad its not scott mills who sounds just like a local radio dj , and colin and edith just talk over each other far too manically like they cant believe they are on radio 1 .
personally , i do n't mind sara .
both her and chris have a unique brand of humour which does n't fit with some people with a staid attitude .
frank , uk chris moyles ?
saviour of radio 1 ?
do n't think so ... his show is stewed , overcooked and basically - boring !
in the beginning his arrogant ramblings were kind of humorous , but as soon as i started preferring scott mills i knew that moyles had had his day .
yes ... you sometimes need a translator to understand sara cox , but at least she never let her own ego get in the way of the music , which often contained some little gems .
jo whiley , mark and lard followed by cox will be a good afternoon line up ... just get rid of dave pearce and send him and the moyles show into the depths of late night programming and radio 1 will be a better place .
this may be controversial but what about ant n dec for breakfast ?
chris , cardiff , wales this is the best news i 've heard all week !
i stopped listening to radio one over a year ago because of sara cox and am thrilled to hear that moyles has been handed the crown so will be returning to the fold one the change has taken place .
i wish chris the best of luck and hope that he does n't tone things down for the new time slot .
lori smith , manchester , uk chris moyles has the humour and spark needed to make the breakfast show a hit for radio 1 , my only grumble is they left sara cox on for so long when she is clearly not suited to breakfast radio .
ian , uk completely gutted !
sara cox made every morning that little bit more bearable - hilarious , down to earth and camper than a row of tents .
with chris moyles at the helm , radio 2 has never been more appealing !
mark , london , uk i think the chris moyles is definitely a backwards step .
a stepback to the 1980s with james whale-style programming .
why is someone whose supposed talent is based on ignorance , abuse and arrogance going to be the saviour of radio 1 ?
i think trusting the anchor for a full day 's scheduling with a character such as this is desperate and narrow-minded , and now is the time for the public to speak up .
raymond murray , uk i do n't think the swap is a good idea , chris moyles is far too fond of the sound of his own voice !
i do n't actually listen to the breakfast show as i think sarah cox does n't play a good mix of music , but i definitely wo n't be listening now .
i think the best man for the job is scott mills , he 's funny and the music is a good mix of everything .
lucie homer , uk i am a big fan of moyles , so i am a little disappointed at the news he is moving to the breakfast show .
i will only be able to listen to him for 15 minutes and imagine he would be annoying at that time of the day - cox certainly is .
however , i wish him the best of luck and i am sure he will raise the ratings .
mark , uk chris moyles is a talentless , unfunny , bitter and twisted dj , so why the bbc would put him on prime is a mystery to me .
i have never met anyone who can bear more than a minute of his obnoxious drivel .
russell b , uk go moylesy !
colin & edith are great too , they might have been my first choice , but anything 's better than sara cox .
the only reason i listen to radio 1 in the mornings at the moment is because i ca n't stand the ads on commercial radio and radio 4 is n't enough to wake me up !
jennie , england i think colin and edith should get the breakfast show and moyles should stay in the afternoon .
they have done a good job standing in and chris moyles seems to suit the afternoon slot .
also , i have more chance of listening to the radio in the pm when moyles is on !
chris , uk personally i think sara cox is wicked on the breakfast show and the reason i do n't currently listen to radio 1 during drive time is because i ca n't stand chris moyles !
maybe the drop in listeners is due to the fact that she has hardly presented during the last few months .
i do n't even listen when she is away !
kate gunn , england i have a choice between radio 1 and local radio on my way to work during breakfast and from work during chris moyles ' show .
moyles is an idiot and colin and edith totally ruin the breakfast show , because all three prefer their own voices to the music .
of chris , sara and colin and edith , only sara is worth listening to and i 'll be sticking to local radio from now on in .
ben taylor , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 mark fry , england thank god they 've seen the light of day and dropped sara cox ! !
it 's just a shame they 've replaced her with the equally annoying chris moyles - why could n't they have put colin and edith in breakfast slot permanently ?
kirsten , leeds , uk sara was the only bright spot in an otherwise increasingly awful programme .
the insultingly moronic " news " -lrb- aka latest bbc festival announcement -rrb- , the boring competitions and phone-ins , the terrible play-list and habit of playing certain songs every single morning for months and months ¿ surely these are the reasons for the drop in numbers .
if chris can change all this then the show might be in with a chance .
fiona , uk thank god sara cox is going .
the woman talks too fast and is n't funny . the move ca n't come to soon .
i think colin & edith would be better than chris moyles .
elaine freeman , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both well past their sell by date .
people do n't want to listen to them any more , that 's why audience figures are falling .
moving the schedules around wo n't change anything .
i tuned out of radio 1 months ago because i was sick of them both .
david , uk i think chris is best suited where he is .
colin and edith have filled in well during cox 's recent absences .
i must admit i have found a local radio station 's breakfast presenter a " better listen " in the mornings recently .
good luck sara , seems the tide has turned against you .
it 's a shame .
dave , uk i 've felt all along that moyles ' style was more suited to a breakfast slot , and would therefore be better than coxy , and finally , a bit too late for some , radio 1 make the switch .
at least this 'll mean coxy will be up against her mate zoe ball on xfm , which should be fun ...
stevie , england i ca n't think of a better bloke to wake up to in the morning ! !
he 'll be great .
sharon , uk no !
i ca n't believe coxy is leaving and i really ca n't believe moyles will take over- two dreadful decisions .
morag , uk i 'm only disappointed they are keeping her at all !
i am one of the many who have stopped listening to the breakfast show although to be fair , it was n't just because of the host , the music sucked too !
yan g , uk this is the biggest mistake radio 1 have ever made .
moving chris , fair enough .
putting cox on in the afternoon , the reason the show was loosing listeners was because of her .
what 's she going to do to the afternoon listening figures ?
oh well guess i 'll be listening to radio 2 all day now .
lee carter , uk i 'll be surprised if moyles manages to turn around the figures based on the fact that he 's the countries most irritating dj .
i 'll be finding a new radio station to listen to in the mornings .
james , uk i wake up to sara everyday and it 's the best start in the morning .
do n't replace her !
bobbi , uk to be honest i have been turning over stations in the morning drive to work once sara came on at 7am .
i will welcome chris moyles taking over but will miss him during my drive home from work .
jon baylis , wigan , uk .
i stopped listening to radio 1 when zoe ball left .
to hear that moyles is taking over is an improvement but still wo n't bring me back .
much prefer our local station heart fm .
kelly , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 , rather than kicked into the " talentless shouty person " bucket where she belongs .
mark fry , england i listen to radio 1 on the way to and from work .
i 'm glad to see that sara cox will no longer being irritating me in the mornings !
it 's just a pity that colin and edith are n't taking over the drive time show .
good luck to chris moyles !
laura , uk what a shame , i am a loyal listener to the moyles show which fits perfectly into the afternoon .
most people i assume that listen to moyles are travelling to work at that time in the morning , or still in bed .
he will be sorely missed at 3pm ! !
sarah , england the afternoon on radio one is the best around at the moment - mark and lard followed by chris moyles .
chris is one of the funniest djs on the radio at the moment and you can understand why bosses want to try him on their primetime slot to boost falling figures .
but will he lose his spark by having to make those early morning shows - especially with his reputation for having and odd drink or two ?
andrew lowe , uk chris is the only choice for the breakfast show , but putting sara in the prime spot in the afternoon may be a mistake .
we 'll just have to wait and see ...
rob spencer , england why on earth is chris moyles taking over the breakfast show ?
he is easily the worst dj on radio 1 , he and his sidekicks spend the entire show spouting nonsense which is no more entertaining than listening to five year old boys .
the last thing i want is to have to listen to that inane rubbish first thing in the morning .
no more radio 1 for me .
alan petrie , scotland what a great move !
chris moyles is brilliant , but why have they moved sara cox to drivetime ?
could they not just replace her with scott mills .
his position at radio 1 does not reflect his level of talent .
ian rawlins , england are you sure this is wise ?
chris moyles has n't done breakfast in years .
he used to be really good , but i remember steve wright being ace in the afternoon and a flop at breakfast ...
never got on with coxy , her voice is like nails down a blackboard - surely mills in the afternoon and letting her go would have been more attractive to the audience ?
dave cartwright , uk radio 1 have missed a serious trick with this move .
why keep someone if no one is listening .
why not give edith and colin the breakfast slot as they have proved to be best thing on radio 1 .
moyles is not funny and the prospect of listening to him first thing in the morning is frightening .
so long radio 1 i fear i will no longer be listening .
mike scruton , england moyles ?
looks like radio 2 for me on the road to work in the new year .
i thought edith and colin would have been a better choice .
andy , scotland i do n't think chris is a good choice for the breakfast slot , because he is to loud and ' in your face ' for that time of the morning .
greg o 'connell , uk bad move , chris is an arse , his show annoys me , his side-kicks are ok but chris ¿ selfish / offensive attitude stinks and is something you can do without first thing in the morning .
i usually switch to a local station in the afternoon , looks like i 'll be doing it in the morning now instead !
daheidsta , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
ian , uk at last !
time to re-tune my radio back to radio 1 .
bye bye coxy .
martin ross , uk chris moyles radio style is completely suited to the afternoon show , colin and edith should have been given the breakfast show .
i do n't see how sara can stay at radio 1 after the negative publicity .
mark smith , u.k from idiot to imbecile .
radio 1 is irrelevant .
techno techno handbag disco .
iain nicholson , uk could be a great swap .
sara often says she has to leave parties early because of her show .
this way we will now get all the gossip .
not much good for her liver though .
steve c , uk i 'm very sorry to hear sara is to be axed - i will be switching off when moyles takes over - if anyone should take over it should be scott mills - at least he has some intelligence .
jeane anderson , uk sara will be sorely missed on the breakfast show , i really enjoyed listening to her over the internet every morning while i was living in germany .
chris moyles is fine for a late afternoon show but i do n't think i could stomach him first thing in the morning !
caroline , uk if any dj on radio 1 can save the breakfast show , then it 's chris moyles .
not that i do n't like sara cox , but there has been a lack lustre to the whole morning show since chris evans left .
i for one will be tuning back in to hear it .
dave pigott , uk i will miss sara in a morning , she makes driving to work so much more enjoyable !
she 's absolutely hilarious and my favourite dj by far .
maybe it 's the northern sense of humour ...
i 'm really glad she 'll still be on radio 1 .
stephanie ainscough , blackpool , england i think radio 1 has made the right decision .
chris is a great presenter at any time of the day , but he now has to prove that he is the " saviour " of radio 1 , and work his magic on the breakfast slot ! !
trace , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
i listen to radio 1 avidly every weekday ; once on my way to work , once on the way home .
mornings were getting very irritating .
i guess now i should face irritating evenings instead .
colin and edith should be present in the new line up , they 're fresh , interesting and less vulgar .
ian , uk it 's bad enough listening to tiresome fart jokes in the afternoon .
who wants to listen to it first thing in the morning ?
moyles is a loud bully who thinks he 's the king of the celebrity social scene , and talks about little more than whatever reality show is currently on tv .
was that recent bbc talent search a failure ?
it would appear so .
angry from redhill , england radio 1 is losing daytime listeners , not because of the dj 's , but because of it 's inane and repetitive playlists that focus on the top 40 and so called popular artists , rather than offering a broad and cosmopolitan mix of music .
nigel , england about time too .
moyles should have got the show when zoe ball left .
i will be switching on to radio 1 in the morning and off during the afternoon .
dave , uk i am glad that radio 1 have dropped sara cox .
i was an avid morning listener before she arrived and am afraid i switched radio stations as i found her appalling .
fiona , uk yay ! about time .
glad to see her go .
bring on colin and edith ! ! ! susan , uk shame on radio one !
sara cox is the reason i started listening to radio 1 in the mornings again .
she is sexy , genuinely witty and well worth the licence fee .
chris moyles is the reason i turn over while driving home for the opposite reasons .
he is a poor man 's chris evans with only a fraction of the talent .
still , my homeward journey will be all the better in the company of ms cox !
karl , leeds , uk leave sara in her job , chris moyles sucks !
silvio , uk great , could n't listen to her from day one .
but i can thank her for pushing me over to radio five live .
try not to let her or moyles near five live .
nigel , england chris moyles is indeed the saviour of radio 1 .
it 's about time the bosses at radio 1 spread the age of the target audience group .
although in the early stages sara was appealing it soon changed to school radio .
for almost half of the days shows the target age group is in school or college and not driving to work finding local radio more appealing .
good luck to chris moyles jarv , uk spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks ryan , uk hooray !
one form of childishness to another !
matthew revell , wolverhampton , uk i think its the best decision that radio 1 have made for some years .
he 's the best on the radio and will be able to put everyone in good step for the rest of the day .
all they need to do now is swap mark and lard around with scott mills to create a super daytime line up !
richard , plymouth , england a long time coming .
well done chris .
see ya cox abs , uk hurrah !
best news ever !
i only ever listen to radio 1 when moyles is filling in because sara cox has had less and less to say over the past two years , now she rambles on in monotone .
sometimes i ca n't even hear what she 's saying because she mumbles so much .
hurrah for chris moyles in the morning to really wake me up !
lindsay , uk yaaaayyyyyy !
at last annoying " cox-ey " is out !
no more dull stories of her celebrity friends & what she did the night before .
i 'm so happy ! andy , uk thank god she 's going , i have always found her annoying .
chris is good and will be much better than sarah - but why not give it to colin & edith ?
when they have been standing in for sarah , they have been great and by far the most enjoyable djs to listen to .
nick , uk radio 1 are replacing one annoying person with another .
neither will make me tune back to the station in the morning .
they need someone who is n't grating first thing in the morning .
paul , uk thank god sara cox is probably the worst radio dj ever .
the only problem is now the drive home is going to be torture .
ca n't they just get rid of her completely darren rees , uk ca n't help but think that it will be like twins presenting the bbc breakfast shows with moyles on radio 1 and jupitus on 6 music chris gullick , newport , south wales not a moment too soon .
i live in south dorset where the commercial alternatives are non-existent and have had to put up with her crass noise for 3 1/2 years .
even this morning she made a comment after returning from a wedding anniversary break stating ' she might be walking funny ' .
how does a parent explain that to their children ?
colin and edith should have been given the slot - their recent breakfast shows have been funny and intelligent .
mark f , uk sometimes , after an undemanding day i can just about cope with moyles , his rants and his ' style ' of bullying his sidekicks .
so no , i wo n't be able to listen at 7am .
have we really got such a dearth of talent in this country that a sexist oaf is the only option ?
lisa , uk it really does n't matter who hosts the breakfast show on this redundant radio station that speaks to no-one about anything .
it has just shown further how out of touch with what people want and need parfitt is by giving the half-wit oaf moyles any further publicity .
the bbc should be ashamed of itself .
at least radio 2 has had the sense to get rid of edmonds after a short but still too long spell on drivetime. kath rice , uk i think chris moyles will be too overpowering first thing in the morning , sara and the team are a great start to the day .
kirsty , uk great choice and well overdue .
i was disappointed that chris moyles did n't take over from zoe ball when she left but now he is getting his chance .
he is a personality and a half , i love listening to his afternoon show over here in the usa and my only regret is that i will miss his new morning show .
lynne akom , usa i think sara cox and chris moyles are , broadly speaking , as talentless as each other .
empty-headed humour and meandering drivel a second time round will surely be the last thing to draw listeners back to radio 1 .
paul tester , uk sara cox is terrible , she just mutters nonsense .
moyles is alright , but i do n't think he 's 7am material .
colin & edith did a great job over the past few weeks - why not offer them it ?
dave , uk at last !
radio 1 has been unlistenable since cox took over the breakfast slot to delight us with her droning tales of ' getting wasted ' .
moyles ai n't exactly enlightenment but at least has enough of a spark of irony to tempt me back from radio 4 !
rich , uk moyles was obviously the first choice and good luck to the fella , my journeys to the office should be a little more bearable now !
spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks while coxy was ' on-leave ? '
keep up the good work you 2 , funny , quick and too good for rise ! !
ryan , uk it 's not just the djs it is more to do with the fact that the playlist clerks pick the most rubbish music to play and it 's all talk talk talk , if you wanted that you would tape newsnight and watch that in the morning - it would be more exciting carl , uk aww cmon , there 's far too many " moyles negative " statements here , however chris is indeed the saviour of ' afternoon ' radio , and should stay there .
matt , uk chris moyles is a talentless moron who seems to believe he 's god 's gift to radio .
he would do better on hospital radio - at least there he 'd have a captive audience .
angela b , uk i will be really sad to see sara go as she has brightened my mornings and made me able to face work with a smile !
i 'm glad that colin and edith are n't going to take over as i find them really boring .
i good luck in your new show sara - i for one will definitely be listening !
ceri h-j , uk i do think cox has lost her touch on the breakfast show and it is time she stepped down , but choosing chris moyles to replace her is not the best move radio 1 have made .
moyles style is not really suited to the morning slot , especially if he starts to shout and rant like he often does in the afternoon .
and his references to life in the ' 80s and early ' 90s would be lost on most of his younger audience .
in the afternoon slot he has a much older adult audience , and they appreciate his style and humour .
unlike the breakfast slot which seems to have a core audience of school kids and young adults on their way to work .
i do n't think they will get what moyles is about most of the time .
bring on colin and edith !
kate , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both as irritating to listen to as each other - jo whiley is the only decent daytime dj and if the breakfast slot is supposedly the most important would n't it make sense to tempt her there ? !
andrea , uk i thought sara cox was pretty good - she used to keep me sane during my monday morning drive along the m4 & round the m25 - and i 'm sure chris will be fine too .
but please get colin & edith off breakfast ! !
they 're the most annoying , predictable , brainless presenters i 've ever heard - they sound like they belong on some local commercial station -lrb- no offence commercial -rrb- .
i listen to radio 1 because it promotes quality , and colin & edith are definitely not .
plus they talk over the end of songs - far too eager to hear their own voices for my liking .
anyway , that 's my rant over ! !
jane , uk i 've really enjoyed waking up to sara in the mornings ¿ she makes me laugh .
i 've listened to the radio 1 breakfast show for over 20 years , but if chris moyles takes over then i 'll move to a different station .
if colin & edith take over , i 'll stay with radio 1 .
gill pitts , england who am i supposed to listen to on the drive home from work now ?
the local radio station in exeter is just about bearable in the morning , and i 've enjoyed chris moyles since he was on the late shift at capital fm .
he was the best antidote for a boring day at work , or a long afternoon drive back up to london for the weekend !
i certainly wo n't be tuning into sara cox 's afternoons - i ca n't stand her !
stephen , uk the difference between the two djs will be obvious when they swap : cox is annoying , uncharismatic and dim-witted , while moyles 's arrogance is only affected and his jokes tongue-in-cheek .
he 's no bully - he 's just having a laugh .
good decision bbc .
stuart , uk i discovered radio 2 because of sara cox and her mind-numbing breakfast show .
i never thought i 'd ever listen to radio 2 before the age of 40 -lrb- i 'm 27 -rrb- , but terry wogan & co do n't play gangsta rap - and therefore do n't try to pretend it 's cool - they do n't irritate me and terry is actually rather funny !
claire , england i have been one of the thousands of listeners to have turned over to another station in the morning .
i would have rather seen colin and edith replace coxy .
they are original and just what is needed for that time of day .
chris moyles should carry on in the afternoon .
why change a good thing ?
coxy seems to have run out of ideas and the bbc are only moving the problem .
chris , united kingdom what a bad , bad decision .
colin and edith , now that would bring me back to radio 1 in the mornings .
debbie sheppard , uk i think they 're both brilliant , so i will still listen to both .
they are the best two on the station by far , although i do like scott mills too .
i hope sara cox does n't get down about being dropped from the breakfast show .
i think she 's absolutely hilarious and very witty , but i suppose some people are a bit prudish and that 's why they may have stopped listening .
they ought to get real cos she tells it like it is !
big up to sara !

the move comes after months of speculation that cox was to be replaced following falling audiences .
cox will replace moyles as the host of the afternoon show of the bbc 's flagship pop music station .
" i am absolutely delighted that chris has agreed to host the new breakfast show , " said radio 1 controller andy parfitt on tuesday .
mr parfitt said moyles was his " only choice " as a replacement , adding that cox had done a " great job " over the last three and a half years .
" in a market that is getting more competitive by the month , i think chris is going to be just what our audience is looking for , " he said .
sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible bbc spokesman her successor profiled moyles said : " i am really chuffed - i 've said for ages that i am the saviour of radio 1 , now it looks i am finally going to have the chance to prove it ! "
cox said she had " a great time " doing the show - but the prospect of a lie-in was " extremely appealing " .
two months ago it was revealed that the breakfast show had lost 433,000 listeners in the space of a month , although it was still drawing an audience of 6.6 million .
at the time the bbc denied reports that cox was facing being dropped because of falling audience figures .
it described as " nonsense " a newspaper story suggesting she would be sacked if listener figures did not improve in the next 10 weeks , insisting radio 1 would keep cox on the show until the end of her contract in april .
a radio 1 spokesman told bbc news online on tuesday : " sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible .
" sara will remain at radio 1 on our drivetime show , and she remains a vital part of the radio 1 line-up . "
moyles has deputised for cox and her predecessor , zoe ball , on the breakfast show since he joined radio 1 in 1997 .
rising stars colin murray and edith bowman have also recently appeared on the show as stand-ins .
ball , who is now drivetime dj on london rock station xfm , said she was looking forward to some " friendly rivalry " with cox in her new time slot .
" she may be one of my best friends but if she thinks she 's going to be taking any of my xfm listeners , she can think again , " she said .
what do you think of the decision ?
please see below for a selection of your comments .
the reason that there is a lot of ' moyles negative ' statements on here is that a majority of people find him so annoying to listen to .
if he is the saviour of radio , then i 'd rather switch to tv !
paul smith , uk thank god - sara cox is the most irritating dj ever .
moyles is very good in the afternoon and i would have preferred him to stay there and scott mills to have taken the breakfast slot .
if it was felt that mills was n't up to this he should have been given the drivetime slot and sara cox finished completely .
pete , england trust the bbc to completely mis-understand the talents of their own presenters ! ! ! !
leave moyles where he is .
remember what happened to steve wright !
put colin & edith on in the morning and drop cox completely .
surely that was the way to go .
chris is brilliant in the afternoon and moving him to the morning , in my opinion , is not a wise idea .
colin & edith , however , have proved they have the energy and fun to make a morning show work .
i hope i 'm wrong , but i doubt it !
simon , uk how pleased i was to hear cox was leaving only to be downheartened by hearing she is taking over the afternoon slot .
her voice is like nails scraping down a blackboard .
please retire her before i rip out my radio from my car and throw it out of the window .
rebecca , uk once again the radio 1 bosses have mis-read their audience .
the reason for falling audience figures for the breakfast slot is the weakness of the show format : egos and in-jokes .
answer : bring in an ego who thrives on in-jokes .
at least colin and edith know the music !
simon , uk chris moyles is just soooo awful !
i switched to capital ages ago , despite the annoying advertising .
i like to listen to music on the radio when running in the morning - but not radio one .
scott mills is great and it is a shame he cant be on the breakfast slot .
michelle , uk cox was great .
colin and edith being on was the reason i stopped listening ! steve , uk shame .
i liked sara cox and found her amusing to listen to on my drive to work .
hope she will enjoy her new show and will tune in on my way home .
do n't like chris moyles though so will stick to local radio in the morning .
it is interesting to read all the comments here though !
chris , uk only a couple of these comments refer to the real problem - the music .
surely that 's why we listen to radio in the first place ?
radio one 's playlist is too limited and the same few songs get played to death before they 're even released .
pete , england chris moyles is the best dj .
its refreshing to have someone who is different from the rest .
glad its not scott mills who sounds just like a local radio dj , and colin and edith just talk over each other far too manically like they cant believe they are on radio 1 .
personally , i do n't mind sara .
both her and chris have a unique brand of humour which does n't fit with some people with a staid attitude .
frank , uk chris moyles ?
saviour of radio 1 ?
do n't think so ... his show is stewed , overcooked and basically - boring !
in the beginning his arrogant ramblings were kind of humorous , but as soon as i started preferring scott mills i knew that moyles had had his day .
yes ... you sometimes need a translator to understand sara cox , but at least she never let her own ego get in the way of the music , which often contained some little gems .
jo whiley , mark and lard followed by cox will be a good afternoon line up ... just get rid of dave pearce and send him and the moyles show into the depths of late night programming and radio 1 will be a better place .
this may be controversial but what about ant n dec for breakfast ?
chris , cardiff , wales this is the best news i 've heard all week !
i stopped listening to radio one over a year ago because of sara cox and am thrilled to hear that moyles has been handed the crown so will be returning to the fold one the change has taken place .
i wish chris the best of luck and hope that he does n't tone things down for the new time slot .
lori smith , manchester , uk chris moyles has the humour and spark needed to make the breakfast show a hit for radio 1 , my only grumble is they left sara cox on for so long when she is clearly not suited to breakfast radio .
ian , uk completely gutted !
sara cox made every morning that little bit more bearable - hilarious , down to earth and camper than a row of tents .
with chris moyles at the helm , radio 2 has never been more appealing !
mark , london , uk i think the chris moyles is definitely a backwards step .
a stepback to the 1980s with james whale-style programming .
why is someone whose supposed talent is based on ignorance , abuse and arrogance going to be the saviour of radio 1 ?
i think trusting the anchor for a full day 's scheduling with a character such as this is desperate and narrow-minded , and now is the time for the public to speak up .
raymond murray , uk i do n't think the swap is a good idea , chris moyles is far too fond of the sound of his own voice !
i do n't actually listen to the breakfast show as i think sarah cox does n't play a good mix of music , but i definitely wo n't be listening now .
i think the best man for the job is scott mills , he 's funny and the music is a good mix of everything .
lucie homer , uk i am a big fan of moyles , so i am a little disappointed at the news he is moving to the breakfast show .
i will only be able to listen to him for 15 minutes and imagine he would be annoying at that time of the day - cox certainly is .
however , i wish him the best of luck and i am sure he will raise the ratings .
mark , uk chris moyles is a talentless , unfunny , bitter and twisted dj , so why the bbc would put him on prime is a mystery to me .
i have never met anyone who can bear more than a minute of his obnoxious drivel .
russell b , uk go moylesy !
colin & edith are great too , they might have been my first choice , but anything 's better than sara cox .
the only reason i listen to radio 1 in the mornings at the moment is because i ca n't stand the ads on commercial radio and radio 4 is n't enough to wake me up !
jennie , england i think colin and edith should get the breakfast show and moyles should stay in the afternoon .
they have done a good job standing in and chris moyles seems to suit the afternoon slot .
also , i have more chance of listening to the radio in the pm when moyles is on !
chris , uk personally i think sara cox is wicked on the breakfast show and the reason i do n't currently listen to radio 1 during drive time is because i ca n't stand chris moyles !
maybe the drop in listeners is due to the fact that she has hardly presented during the last few months .
i do n't even listen when she is away !
kate gunn , england i have a choice between radio 1 and local radio on my way to work during breakfast and from work during chris moyles ' show .
moyles is an idiot and colin and edith totally ruin the breakfast show , because all three prefer their own voices to the music .
of chris , sara and colin and edith , only sara is worth listening to and i 'll be sticking to local radio from now on in .
ben taylor , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 mark fry , england thank god they 've seen the light of day and dropped sara cox ! !
it 's just a shame they 've replaced her with the equally annoying chris moyles - why could n't they have put colin and edith in breakfast slot permanently ?
kirsten , leeds , uk sara was the only bright spot in an otherwise increasingly awful programme .
the insultingly moronic " news " -lrb- aka latest bbc festival announcement -rrb- , the boring competitions and phone-ins , the terrible play-list and habit of playing certain songs every single morning for months and months ¿ surely these are the reasons for the drop in numbers .
if chris can change all this then the show might be in with a chance .
fiona , uk thank god sara cox is going .
the woman talks too fast and is n't funny . the move ca n't come to soon .
i think colin & edith would be better than chris moyles .
elaine freeman , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both well past their sell by date .
people do n't want to listen to them any more , that 's why audience figures are falling .
moving the schedules around wo n't change anything .
i tuned out of radio 1 months ago because i was sick of them both .
david , uk i think chris is best suited where he is .
colin and edith have filled in well during cox 's recent absences .
i must admit i have found a local radio station 's breakfast presenter a " better listen " in the mornings recently .
good luck sara , seems the tide has turned against you .
it 's a shame .
dave , uk i 've felt all along that moyles ' style was more suited to a breakfast slot , and would therefore be better than coxy , and finally , a bit too late for some , radio 1 make the switch .
at least this 'll mean coxy will be up against her mate zoe ball on xfm , which should be fun ...
stevie , england i ca n't think of a better bloke to wake up to in the morning ! !
he 'll be great .
sharon , uk no !
i ca n't believe coxy is leaving and i really ca n't believe moyles will take over- two dreadful decisions .
morag , uk i 'm only disappointed they are keeping her at all !
i am one of the many who have stopped listening to the breakfast show although to be fair , it was n't just because of the host , the music sucked too !
yan g , uk this is the biggest mistake radio 1 have ever made .
moving chris , fair enough .
putting cox on in the afternoon , the reason the show was loosing listeners was because of her .
what 's she going to do to the afternoon listening figures ?
oh well guess i 'll be listening to radio 2 all day now .
lee carter , uk i 'll be surprised if moyles manages to turn around the figures based on the fact that he 's the countries most irritating dj .
i 'll be finding a new radio station to listen to in the mornings .
james , uk i wake up to sara everyday and it 's the best start in the morning .
do n't replace her !
bobbi , uk to be honest i have been turning over stations in the morning drive to work once sara came on at 7am .
i will welcome chris moyles taking over but will miss him during my drive home from work .
jon baylis , wigan , uk .
i stopped listening to radio 1 when zoe ball left .
to hear that moyles is taking over is an improvement but still wo n't bring me back .
much prefer our local station heart fm .
kelly , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 , rather than kicked into the " talentless shouty person " bucket where she belongs .
mark fry , england i listen to radio 1 on the way to and from work .
i 'm glad to see that sara cox will no longer being irritating me in the mornings !
it 's just a pity that colin and edith are n't taking over the drive time show .
good luck to chris moyles !
laura , uk what a shame , i am a loyal listener to the moyles show which fits perfectly into the afternoon .
most people i assume that listen to moyles are travelling to work at that time in the morning , or still in bed .
he will be sorely missed at 3pm ! !
sarah , england the afternoon on radio one is the best around at the moment - mark and lard followed by chris moyles .
chris is one of the funniest djs on the radio at the moment and you can understand why bosses want to try him on their primetime slot to boost falling figures .
but will he lose his spark by having to make those early morning shows - especially with his reputation for having and odd drink or two ?
andrew lowe , uk chris is the only choice for the breakfast show , but putting sara in the prime spot in the afternoon may be a mistake .
we 'll just have to wait and see ...
rob spencer , england why on earth is chris moyles taking over the breakfast show ?
he is easily the worst dj on radio 1 , he and his sidekicks spend the entire show spouting nonsense which is no more entertaining than listening to five year old boys .
the last thing i want is to have to listen to that inane rubbish first thing in the morning .
no more radio 1 for me .
alan petrie , scotland what a great move !
chris moyles is brilliant , but why have they moved sara cox to drivetime ?
could they not just replace her with scott mills .
his position at radio 1 does not reflect his level of talent .
ian rawlins , england are you sure this is wise ?
chris moyles has n't done breakfast in years .
he used to be really good , but i remember steve wright being ace in the afternoon and a flop at breakfast ...
never got on with coxy , her voice is like nails down a blackboard - surely mills in the afternoon and letting her go would have been more attractive to the audience ?
dave cartwright , uk radio 1 have missed a serious trick with this move .
why keep someone if no one is listening .
why not give edith and colin the breakfast slot as they have proved to be best thing on radio 1 .
moyles is not funny and the prospect of listening to him first thing in the morning is frightening .
so long radio 1 i fear i will no longer be listening .
mike scruton , england moyles ?
looks like radio 2 for me on the road to work in the new year .
i thought edith and colin would have been a better choice .
andy , scotland i do n't think chris is a good choice for the breakfast slot , because he is to loud and ' in your face ' for that time of the morning .
greg o 'connell , uk bad move , chris is an arse , his show annoys me , his side-kicks are ok but chris ¿ selfish / offensive attitude stinks and is something you can do without first thing in the morning .
i usually switch to a local station in the afternoon , looks like i 'll be doing it in the morning now instead !
daheidsta , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
ian , uk at last !
time to re-tune my radio back to radio 1 .
bye bye coxy .
martin ross , uk chris moyles radio style is completely suited to the afternoon show , colin and edith should have been given the breakfast show .
i do n't see how sara can stay at radio 1 after the negative publicity .
mark smith , u.k from idiot to imbecile .
radio 1 is irrelevant .
techno techno handbag disco .
iain nicholson , uk could be a great swap .
sara often says she has to leave parties early because of her show .
this way we will now get all the gossip .
not much good for her liver though .
steve c , uk i 'm very sorry to hear sara is to be axed - i will be switching off when moyles takes over - if anyone should take over it should be scott mills - at least he has some intelligence .
jeane anderson , uk sara will be sorely missed on the breakfast show , i really enjoyed listening to her over the internet every morning while i was living in germany .
chris moyles is fine for a late afternoon show but i do n't think i could stomach him first thing in the morning !
caroline , uk if any dj on radio 1 can save the breakfast show , then it 's chris moyles .
not that i do n't like sara cox , but there has been a lack lustre to the whole morning show since chris evans left .
i for one will be tuning back in to hear it .
dave pigott , uk i will miss sara in a morning , she makes driving to work so much more enjoyable !
she 's absolutely hilarious and my favourite dj by far .
maybe it 's the northern sense of humour ...
i 'm really glad she 'll still be on radio 1 .
stephanie ainscough , blackpool , england i think radio 1 has made the right decision .
chris is a great presenter at any time of the day , but he now has to prove that he is the " saviour " of radio 1 , and work his magic on the breakfast slot ! !
trace , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
i listen to radio 1 avidly every weekday ; once on my way to work , once on the way home .
mornings were getting very irritating .
i guess now i should face irritating evenings instead .
colin and edith should be present in the new line up , they 're fresh , interesting and less vulgar .
ian , uk it 's bad enough listening to tiresome fart jokes in the afternoon .
who wants to listen to it first thing in the morning ?
moyles is a loud bully who thinks he 's the king of the celebrity social scene , and talks about little more than whatever reality show is currently on tv .
was that recent bbc talent search a failure ?
it would appear so .
angry from redhill , england radio 1 is losing daytime listeners , not because of the dj 's , but because of it 's inane and repetitive playlists that focus on the top 40 and so called popular artists , rather than offering a broad and cosmopolitan mix of music .
nigel , england about time too .
moyles should have got the show when zoe ball left .
i will be switching on to radio 1 in the morning and off during the afternoon .
dave , uk i am glad that radio 1 have dropped sara cox .
i was an avid morning listener before she arrived and am afraid i switched radio stations as i found her appalling .
fiona , uk yay ! about time .
glad to see her go .
bring on colin and edith ! ! ! susan , uk shame on radio one !
sara cox is the reason i started listening to radio 1 in the mornings again .
she is sexy , genuinely witty and well worth the licence fee .
chris moyles is the reason i turn over while driving home for the opposite reasons .
he is a poor man 's chris evans with only a fraction of the talent .
still , my homeward journey will be all the better in the company of ms cox !
karl , leeds , uk leave sara in her job , chris moyles sucks !
silvio , uk great , could n't listen to her from day one .
but i can thank her for pushing me over to radio five live .
try not to let her or moyles near five live .
nigel , england chris moyles is indeed the saviour of radio 1 .
it 's about time the bosses at radio 1 spread the age of the target audience group .
although in the early stages sara was appealing it soon changed to school radio .
for almost half of the days shows the target age group is in school or college and not driving to work finding local radio more appealing .
good luck to chris moyles jarv , uk spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks ryan , uk hooray !
one form of childishness to another !
matthew revell , wolverhampton , uk i think its the best decision that radio 1 have made for some years .
he 's the best on the radio and will be able to put everyone in good step for the rest of the day .
all they need to do now is swap mark and lard around with scott mills to create a super daytime line up !
richard , plymouth , england a long time coming .
well done chris .
see ya cox abs , uk hurrah !
best news ever !
i only ever listen to radio 1 when moyles is filling in because sara cox has had less and less to say over the past two years , now she rambles on in monotone .
sometimes i ca n't even hear what she 's saying because she mumbles so much .
hurrah for chris moyles in the morning to really wake me up !
lindsay , uk yaaaayyyyyy !
at last annoying " cox-ey " is out !
no more dull stories of her celebrity friends & what she did the night before .
i 'm so happy ! andy , uk thank god she 's going , i have always found her annoying .
chris is good and will be much better than sarah - but why not give it to colin & edith ?
when they have been standing in for sarah , they have been great and by far the most enjoyable djs to listen to .
nick , uk radio 1 are replacing one annoying person with another .
neither will make me tune back to the station in the morning .
they need someone who is n't grating first thing in the morning .
paul , uk thank god sara cox is probably the worst radio dj ever .
the only problem is now the drive home is going to be torture .
ca n't they just get rid of her completely darren rees , uk ca n't help but think that it will be like twins presenting the bbc breakfast shows with moyles on radio 1 and jupitus on 6 music chris gullick , newport , south wales not a moment too soon .
i live in south dorset where the commercial alternatives are non-existent and have had to put up with her crass noise for 3 1/2 years .
even this morning she made a comment after returning from a wedding anniversary break stating ' she might be walking funny ' .
how does a parent explain that to their children ?
colin and edith should have been given the slot - their recent breakfast shows have been funny and intelligent .
mark f , uk sometimes , after an undemanding day i can just about cope with moyles , his rants and his ' style ' of bullying his sidekicks .
so no , i wo n't be able to listen at 7am .
have we really got such a dearth of talent in this country that a sexist oaf is the only option ?
lisa , uk it really does n't matter who hosts the breakfast show on this redundant radio station that speaks to no-one about anything .
it has just shown further how out of touch with what people want and need parfitt is by giving the half-wit oaf moyles any further publicity .
the bbc should be ashamed of itself .
at least radio 2 has had the sense to get rid of edmonds after a short but still too long spell on drivetime. kath rice , uk i think chris moyles will be too overpowering first thing in the morning , sara and the team are a great start to the day .
kirsty , uk great choice and well overdue .
i was disappointed that chris moyles did n't take over from zoe ball when she left but now he is getting his chance .
he is a personality and a half , i love listening to his afternoon show over here in the usa and my only regret is that i will miss his new morning show .
lynne akom , usa i think sara cox and chris moyles are , broadly speaking , as talentless as each other .
empty-headed humour and meandering drivel a second time round will surely be the last thing to draw listeners back to radio 1 .
paul tester , uk sara cox is terrible , she just mutters nonsense .
moyles is alright , but i do n't think he 's 7am material .
colin & edith did a great job over the past few weeks - why not offer them it ?
dave , uk at last !
radio 1 has been unlistenable since cox took over the breakfast slot to delight us with her droning tales of ' getting wasted ' .
moyles ai n't exactly enlightenment but at least has enough of a spark of irony to tempt me back from radio 4 !
rich , uk moyles was obviously the first choice and good luck to the fella , my journeys to the office should be a little more bearable now !
spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks while coxy was ' on-leave ? '
keep up the good work you 2 , funny , quick and too good for rise ! !
ryan , uk it 's not just the djs it is more to do with the fact that the playlist clerks pick the most rubbish music to play and it 's all talk talk talk , if you wanted that you would tape newsnight and watch that in the morning - it would be more exciting carl , uk aww cmon , there 's far too many " moyles negative " statements here , however chris is indeed the saviour of ' afternoon ' radio , and should stay there .
matt , uk chris moyles is a talentless moron who seems to believe he 's god 's gift to radio .
he would do better on hospital radio - at least there he 'd have a captive audience .
angela b , uk i will be really sad to see sara go as she has brightened my mornings and made me able to face work with a smile !
i 'm glad that colin and edith are n't going to take over as i find them really boring .
i good luck in your new show sara - i for one will definitely be listening !
ceri h-j , uk i do think cox has lost her touch on the breakfast show and it is time she stepped down , but choosing chris moyles to replace her is not the best move radio 1 have made .
moyles style is not really suited to the morning slot , especially if he starts to shout and rant like he often does in the afternoon .
and his references to life in the ' 80s and early ' 90s would be lost on most of his younger audience .
in the afternoon slot he has a much older adult audience , and they appreciate his style and humour .
unlike the breakfast slot which seems to have a core audience of school kids and young adults on their way to work .
i do n't think they will get what moyles is about most of the time .
bring on colin and edith !
kate , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both as irritating to listen to as each other - jo whiley is the only decent daytime dj and if the breakfast slot is supposedly the most important would n't it make sense to tempt her there ? !
andrea , uk i thought sara cox was pretty good - she used to keep me sane during my monday morning drive along the m4 & round the m25 - and i 'm sure chris will be fine too .
but please get colin & edith off breakfast ! !
they 're the most annoying , predictable , brainless presenters i 've ever heard - they sound like they belong on some local commercial station -lrb- no offence commercial -rrb- .
i listen to radio 1 because it promotes quality , and colin & edith are definitely not .
plus they talk over the end of songs - far too eager to hear their own voices for my liking .
anyway , that 's my rant over ! !
jane , uk i 've really enjoyed waking up to sara in the mornings ¿ she makes me laugh .
i 've listened to the radio 1 breakfast show for over 20 years , but if chris moyles takes over then i 'll move to a different station .
if colin & edith take over , i 'll stay with radio 1 .
gill pitts , england who am i supposed to listen to on the drive home from work now ?
the local radio station in exeter is just about bearable in the morning , and i 've enjoyed chris moyles since he was on the late shift at capital fm .
he was the best antidote for a boring day at work , or a long afternoon drive back up to london for the weekend !
i certainly wo n't be tuning into sara cox 's afternoons - i ca n't stand her !
stephen , uk the difference between the two djs will be obvious when they swap : cox is annoying , uncharismatic and dim-witted , while moyles 's arrogance is only affected and his jokes tongue-in-cheek .
he 's no bully - he 's just having a laugh .
good decision bbc .
stuart , uk i discovered radio 2 because of sara cox and her mind-numbing breakfast show .
i never thought i 'd ever listen to radio 2 before the age of 40 -lrb- i 'm 27 -rrb- , but terry wogan & co do n't play gangsta rap - and therefore do n't try to pretend it 's cool - they do n't irritate me and terry is actually rather funny !
claire , england i have been one of the thousands of listeners to have turned over to another station in the morning .
i would have rather seen colin and edith replace coxy .
they are original and just what is needed for that time of day .
chris moyles should carry on in the afternoon .
why change a good thing ?
coxy seems to have run out of ideas and the bbc are only moving the problem .
chris , united kingdom what a bad , bad decision .
colin and edith , now that would bring me back to radio 1 in the mornings .
debbie sheppard , uk i think they 're both brilliant , so i will still listen to both .
they are the best two on the station by far , although i do like scott mills too .
i hope sara cox does n't get down about being dropped from the breakfast show .
i think she 's absolutely hilarious and very witty , but i suppose some people are a bit prudish and that 's why they may have stopped listening .
they ought to get real cos she tells it like it is !
big up to sara !

the move comes after months of speculation that cox was to be replaced following falling audiences .
cox will replace moyles as the host of the afternoon show of the bbc 's flagship pop music station .
" i am absolutely delighted that chris has agreed to host the new breakfast show , " said radio 1 controller andy parfitt on tuesday .
mr parfitt said moyles was his " only choice " as a replacement , adding that cox had done a " great job " over the last three and a half years .
" in a market that is getting more competitive by the month , i think chris is going to be just what our audience is looking for , " he said .
sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible bbc spokesman her successor profiled moyles said : " i am really chuffed - i 've said for ages that i am the saviour of radio 1 , now it looks i am finally going to have the chance to prove it ! "
cox said she had " a great time " doing the show - but the prospect of a lie-in was " extremely appealing " .
two months ago it was revealed that the breakfast show had lost 433,000 listeners in the space of a month , although it was still drawing an audience of 6.6 million .
at the time the bbc denied reports that cox was facing being dropped because of falling audience figures .
it described as " nonsense " a newspaper story suggesting she would be sacked if listener figures did not improve in the next 10 weeks , insisting radio 1 would keep cox on the show until the end of her contract in april .
a radio 1 spokesman told bbc news online on tuesday : " sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible .
" sara will remain at radio 1 on our drivetime show , and she remains a vital part of the radio 1 line-up . "
moyles has deputised for cox and her predecessor , zoe ball , on the breakfast show since he joined radio 1 in 1997 .
rising stars colin murray and edith bowman have also recently appeared on the show as stand-ins .
ball , who is now drivetime dj on london rock station xfm , said she was looking forward to some " friendly rivalry " with cox in her new time slot .
" she may be one of my best friends but if she thinks she 's going to be taking any of my xfm listeners , she can think again , " she said .
what do you think of the decision ?
please see below for a selection of your comments .
the reason that there is a lot of ' moyles negative ' statements on here is that a majority of people find him so annoying to listen to .
if he is the saviour of radio , then i 'd rather switch to tv !
paul smith , uk thank god - sara cox is the most irritating dj ever .
moyles is very good in the afternoon and i would have preferred him to stay there and scott mills to have taken the breakfast slot .
if it was felt that mills was n't up to this he should have been given the drivetime slot and sara cox finished completely .
pete , england trust the bbc to completely mis-understand the talents of their own presenters ! ! ! !
leave moyles where he is .
remember what happened to steve wright !
put colin & edith on in the morning and drop cox completely .
surely that was the way to go .
chris is brilliant in the afternoon and moving him to the morning , in my opinion , is not a wise idea .
colin & edith , however , have proved they have the energy and fun to make a morning show work .
i hope i 'm wrong , but i doubt it !
simon , uk how pleased i was to hear cox was leaving only to be downheartened by hearing she is taking over the afternoon slot .
her voice is like nails scraping down a blackboard .
please retire her before i rip out my radio from my car and throw it out of the window .
rebecca , uk once again the radio 1 bosses have mis-read their audience .
the reason for falling audience figures for the breakfast slot is the weakness of the show format : egos and in-jokes .
answer : bring in an ego who thrives on in-jokes .
at least colin and edith know the music !
simon , uk chris moyles is just soooo awful !
i switched to capital ages ago , despite the annoying advertising .
i like to listen to music on the radio when running in the morning - but not radio one .
scott mills is great and it is a shame he cant be on the breakfast slot .
michelle , uk cox was great .
colin and edith being on was the reason i stopped listening ! steve , uk shame .
i liked sara cox and found her amusing to listen to on my drive to work .
hope she will enjoy her new show and will tune in on my way home .
do n't like chris moyles though so will stick to local radio in the morning .
it is interesting to read all the comments here though !
chris , uk only a couple of these comments refer to the real problem - the music .
surely that 's why we listen to radio in the first place ?
radio one 's playlist is too limited and the same few songs get played to death before they 're even released .
pete , england chris moyles is the best dj .
its refreshing to have someone who is different from the rest .
glad its not scott mills who sounds just like a local radio dj , and colin and edith just talk over each other far too manically like they cant believe they are on radio 1 .
personally , i do n't mind sara .
both her and chris have a unique brand of humour which does n't fit with some people with a staid attitude .
frank , uk chris moyles ?
saviour of radio 1 ?
do n't think so ... his show is stewed , overcooked and basically - boring !
in the beginning his arrogant ramblings were kind of humorous , but as soon as i started preferring scott mills i knew that moyles had had his day .
yes ... you sometimes need a translator to understand sara cox , but at least she never let her own ego get in the way of the music , which often contained some little gems .
jo whiley , mark and lard followed by cox will be a good afternoon line up ... just get rid of dave pearce and send him and the moyles show into the depths of late night programming and radio 1 will be a better place .
this may be controversial but what about ant n dec for breakfast ?
chris , cardiff , wales this is the best news i 've heard all week !
i stopped listening to radio one over a year ago because of sara cox and am thrilled to hear that moyles has been handed the crown so will be returning to the fold one the change has taken place .
i wish chris the best of luck and hope that he does n't tone things down for the new time slot .
lori smith , manchester , uk chris moyles has the humour and spark needed to make the breakfast show a hit for radio 1 , my only grumble is they left sara cox on for so long when she is clearly not suited to breakfast radio .
ian , uk completely gutted !
sara cox made every morning that little bit more bearable - hilarious , down to earth and camper than a row of tents .
with chris moyles at the helm , radio 2 has never been more appealing !
mark , london , uk i think the chris moyles is definitely a backwards step .
a stepback to the 1980s with james whale-style programming .
why is someone whose supposed talent is based on ignorance , abuse and arrogance going to be the saviour of radio 1 ?
i think trusting the anchor for a full day 's scheduling with a character such as this is desperate and narrow-minded , and now is the time for the public to speak up .
raymond murray , uk i do n't think the swap is a good idea , chris moyles is far too fond of the sound of his own voice !
i do n't actually listen to the breakfast show as i think sarah cox does n't play a good mix of music , but i definitely wo n't be listening now .
i think the best man for the job is scott mills , he 's funny and the music is a good mix of everything .
lucie homer , uk i am a big fan of moyles , so i am a little disappointed at the news he is moving to the breakfast show .
i will only be able to listen to him for 15 minutes and imagine he would be annoying at that time of the day - cox certainly is .
however , i wish him the best of luck and i am sure he will raise the ratings .
mark , uk chris moyles is a talentless , unfunny , bitter and twisted dj , so why the bbc would put him on prime is a mystery to me .
i have never met anyone who can bear more than a minute of his obnoxious drivel .
russell b , uk go moylesy !
colin & edith are great too , they might have been my first choice , but anything 's better than sara cox .
the only reason i listen to radio 1 in the mornings at the moment is because i ca n't stand the ads on commercial radio and radio 4 is n't enough to wake me up !
jennie , england i think colin and edith should get the breakfast show and moyles should stay in the afternoon .
they have done a good job standing in and chris moyles seems to suit the afternoon slot .
also , i have more chance of listening to the radio in the pm when moyles is on !
chris , uk personally i think sara cox is wicked on the breakfast show and the reason i do n't currently listen to radio 1 during drive time is because i ca n't stand chris moyles !
maybe the drop in listeners is due to the fact that she has hardly presented during the last few months .
i do n't even listen when she is away !
kate gunn , england i have a choice between radio 1 and local radio on my way to work during breakfast and from work during chris moyles ' show .
moyles is an idiot and colin and edith totally ruin the breakfast show , because all three prefer their own voices to the music .
of chris , sara and colin and edith , only sara is worth listening to and i 'll be sticking to local radio from now on in .
ben taylor , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 mark fry , england thank god they 've seen the light of day and dropped sara cox ! !
it 's just a shame they 've replaced her with the equally annoying chris moyles - why could n't they have put colin and edith in breakfast slot permanently ?
kirsten , leeds , uk sara was the only bright spot in an otherwise increasingly awful programme .
the insultingly moronic " news " -lrb- aka latest bbc festival announcement -rrb- , the boring competitions and phone-ins , the terrible play-list and habit of playing certain songs every single morning for months and months ¿ surely these are the reasons for the drop in numbers .
if chris can change all this then the show might be in with a chance .
fiona , uk thank god sara cox is going .
the woman talks too fast and is n't funny . the move ca n't come to soon .
i think colin & edith would be better than chris moyles .
elaine freeman , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both well past their sell by date .
people do n't want to listen to them any more , that 's why audience figures are falling .
moving the schedules around wo n't change anything .
i tuned out of radio 1 months ago because i was sick of them both .
david , uk i think chris is best suited where he is .
colin and edith have filled in well during cox 's recent absences .
i must admit i have found a local radio station 's breakfast presenter a " better listen " in the mornings recently .
good luck sara , seems the tide has turned against you .
it 's a shame .
dave , uk i 've felt all along that moyles ' style was more suited to a breakfast slot , and would therefore be better than coxy , and finally , a bit too late for some , radio 1 make the switch .
at least this 'll mean coxy will be up against her mate zoe ball on xfm , which should be fun ...
stevie , england i ca n't think of a better bloke to wake up to in the morning ! !
he 'll be great .
sharon , uk no !
i ca n't believe coxy is leaving and i really ca n't believe moyles will take over- two dreadful decisions .
morag , uk i 'm only disappointed they are keeping her at all !
i am one of the many who have stopped listening to the breakfast show although to be fair , it was n't just because of the host , the music sucked too !
yan g , uk this is the biggest mistake radio 1 have ever made .
moving chris , fair enough .
putting cox on in the afternoon , the reason the show was loosing listeners was because of her .
what 's she going to do to the afternoon listening figures ?
oh well guess i 'll be listening to radio 2 all day now .
lee carter , uk i 'll be surprised if moyles manages to turn around the figures based on the fact that he 's the countries most irritating dj .
i 'll be finding a new radio station to listen to in the mornings .
james , uk i wake up to sara everyday and it 's the best start in the morning .
do n't replace her !
bobbi , uk to be honest i have been turning over stations in the morning drive to work once sara came on at 7am .
i will welcome chris moyles taking over but will miss him during my drive home from work .
jon baylis , wigan , uk .
i stopped listening to radio 1 when zoe ball left .
to hear that moyles is taking over is an improvement but still wo n't bring me back .
much prefer our local station heart fm .
kelly , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 , rather than kicked into the " talentless shouty person " bucket where she belongs .
mark fry , england i listen to radio 1 on the way to and from work .
i 'm glad to see that sara cox will no longer being irritating me in the mornings !
it 's just a pity that colin and edith are n't taking over the drive time show .
good luck to chris moyles !
laura , uk what a shame , i am a loyal listener to the moyles show which fits perfectly into the afternoon .
most people i assume that listen to moyles are travelling to work at that time in the morning , or still in bed .
he will be sorely missed at 3pm ! !
sarah , england the afternoon on radio one is the best around at the moment - mark and lard followed by chris moyles .
chris is one of the funniest djs on the radio at the moment and you can understand why bosses want to try him on their primetime slot to boost falling figures .
but will he lose his spark by having to make those early morning shows - especially with his reputation for having and odd drink or two ?
andrew lowe , uk chris is the only choice for the breakfast show , but putting sara in the prime spot in the afternoon may be a mistake .
we 'll just have to wait and see ...
rob spencer , england why on earth is chris moyles taking over the breakfast show ?
he is easily the worst dj on radio 1 , he and his sidekicks spend the entire show spouting nonsense which is no more entertaining than listening to five year old boys .
the last thing i want is to have to listen to that inane rubbish first thing in the morning .
no more radio 1 for me .
alan petrie , scotland what a great move !
chris moyles is brilliant , but why have they moved sara cox to drivetime ?
could they not just replace her with scott mills .
his position at radio 1 does not reflect his level of talent .
ian rawlins , england are you sure this is wise ?
chris moyles has n't done breakfast in years .
he used to be really good , but i remember steve wright being ace in the afternoon and a flop at breakfast ...
never got on with coxy , her voice is like nails down a blackboard - surely mills in the afternoon and letting her go would have been more attractive to the audience ?
dave cartwright , uk radio 1 have missed a serious trick with this move .
why keep someone if no one is listening .
why not give edith and colin the breakfast slot as they have proved to be best thing on radio 1 .
moyles is not funny and the prospect of listening to him first thing in the morning is frightening .
so long radio 1 i fear i will no longer be listening .
mike scruton , england moyles ?
looks like radio 2 for me on the road to work in the new year .
i thought edith and colin would have been a better choice .
andy , scotland i do n't think chris is a good choice for the breakfast slot , because he is to loud and ' in your face ' for that time of the morning .
greg o 'connell , uk bad move , chris is an arse , his show annoys me , his side-kicks are ok but chris ¿ selfish / offensive attitude stinks and is something you can do without first thing in the morning .
i usually switch to a local station in the afternoon , looks like i 'll be doing it in the morning now instead !
daheidsta , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
ian , uk at last !
time to re-tune my radio back to radio 1 .
bye bye coxy .
martin ross , uk chris moyles radio style is completely suited to the afternoon show , colin and edith should have been given the breakfast show .
i do n't see how sara can stay at radio 1 after the negative publicity .
mark smith , u.k from idiot to imbecile .
radio 1 is irrelevant .
techno techno handbag disco .
iain nicholson , uk could be a great swap .
sara often says she has to leave parties early because of her show .
this way we will now get all the gossip .
not much good for her liver though .
steve c , uk i 'm very sorry to hear sara is to be axed - i will be switching off when moyles takes over - if anyone should take over it should be scott mills - at least he has some intelligence .
jeane anderson , uk sara will be sorely missed on the breakfast show , i really enjoyed listening to her over the internet every morning while i was living in germany .
chris moyles is fine for a late afternoon show but i do n't think i could stomach him first thing in the morning !
caroline , uk if any dj on radio 1 can save the breakfast show , then it 's chris moyles .
not that i do n't like sara cox , but there has been a lack lustre to the whole morning show since chris evans left .
i for one will be tuning back in to hear it .
dave pigott , uk i will miss sara in a morning , she makes driving to work so much more enjoyable !
she 's absolutely hilarious and my favourite dj by far .
maybe it 's the northern sense of humour ...
i 'm really glad she 'll still be on radio 1 .
stephanie ainscough , blackpool , england i think radio 1 has made the right decision .
chris is a great presenter at any time of the day , but he now has to prove that he is the " saviour " of radio 1 , and work his magic on the breakfast slot ! !
trace , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
i listen to radio 1 avidly every weekday ; once on my way to work , once on the way home .
mornings were getting very irritating .
i guess now i should face irritating evenings instead .
colin and edith should be present in the new line up , they 're fresh , interesting and less vulgar .
ian , uk it 's bad enough listening to tiresome fart jokes in the afternoon .
who wants to listen to it first thing in the morning ?
moyles is a loud bully who thinks he 's the king of the celebrity social scene , and talks about little more than whatever reality show is currently on tv .
was that recent bbc talent search a failure ?
it would appear so .
angry from redhill , england radio 1 is losing daytime listeners , not because of the dj 's , but because of it 's inane and repetitive playlists that focus on the top 40 and so called popular artists , rather than offering a broad and cosmopolitan mix of music .
nigel , england about time too .
moyles should have got the show when zoe ball left .
i will be switching on to radio 1 in the morning and off during the afternoon .
dave , uk i am glad that radio 1 have dropped sara cox .
i was an avid morning listener before she arrived and am afraid i switched radio stations as i found her appalling .
fiona , uk yay ! about time .
glad to see her go .
bring on colin and edith ! ! ! susan , uk shame on radio one !
sara cox is the reason i started listening to radio 1 in the mornings again .
she is sexy , genuinely witty and well worth the licence fee .
chris moyles is the reason i turn over while driving home for the opposite reasons .
he is a poor man 's chris evans with only a fraction of the talent .
still , my homeward journey will be all the better in the company of ms cox !
karl , leeds , uk leave sara in her job , chris moyles sucks !
silvio , uk great , could n't listen to her from day one .
but i can thank her for pushing me over to radio five live .
try not to let her or moyles near five live .
nigel , england chris moyles is indeed the saviour of radio 1 .
it 's about time the bosses at radio 1 spread the age of the target audience group .
although in the early stages sara was appealing it soon changed to school radio .
for almost half of the days shows the target age group is in school or college and not driving to work finding local radio more appealing .
good luck to chris moyles jarv , uk spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks ryan , uk hooray !
one form of childishness to another !
matthew revell , wolverhampton , uk i think its the best decision that radio 1 have made for some years .
he 's the best on the radio and will be able to put everyone in good step for the rest of the day .
all they need to do now is swap mark and lard around with scott mills to create a super daytime line up !
richard , plymouth , england a long time coming .
well done chris .
see ya cox abs , uk hurrah !
best news ever !
i only ever listen to radio 1 when moyles is filling in because sara cox has had less and less to say over the past two years , now she rambles on in monotone .
sometimes i ca n't even hear what she 's saying because she mumbles so much .
hurrah for chris moyles in the morning to really wake me up !
lindsay , uk yaaaayyyyyy !
at last annoying " cox-ey " is out !
no more dull stories of her celebrity friends & what she did the night before .
i 'm so happy ! andy , uk thank god she 's going , i have always found her annoying .
chris is good and will be much better than sarah - but why not give it to colin & edith ?
when they have been standing in for sarah , they have been great and by far the most enjoyable djs to listen to .
nick , uk radio 1 are replacing one annoying person with another .
neither will make me tune back to the station in the morning .
they need someone who is n't grating first thing in the morning .
paul , uk thank god sara cox is probably the worst radio dj ever .
the only problem is now the drive home is going to be torture .
ca n't they just get rid of her completely darren rees , uk ca n't help but think that it will be like twins presenting the bbc breakfast shows with moyles on radio 1 and jupitus on 6 music chris gullick , newport , south wales not a moment too soon .
i live in south dorset where the commercial alternatives are non-existent and have had to put up with her crass noise for 3 1/2 years .
even this morning she made a comment after returning from a wedding anniversary break stating ' she might be walking funny ' .
how does a parent explain that to their children ?
colin and edith should have been given the slot - their recent breakfast shows have been funny and intelligent .
mark f , uk sometimes , after an undemanding day i can just about cope with moyles , his rants and his ' style ' of bullying his sidekicks .
so no , i wo n't be able to listen at 7am .
have we really got such a dearth of talent in this country that a sexist oaf is the only option ?
lisa , uk it really does n't matter who hosts the breakfast show on this redundant radio station that speaks to no-one about anything .
it has just shown further how out of touch with what people want and need parfitt is by giving the half-wit oaf moyles any further publicity .
the bbc should be ashamed of itself .
at least radio 2 has had the sense to get rid of edmonds after a short but still too long spell on drivetime. kath rice , uk i think chris moyles will be too overpowering first thing in the morning , sara and the team are a great start to the day .
kirsty , uk great choice and well overdue .
i was disappointed that chris moyles did n't take over from zoe ball when she left but now he is getting his chance .
he is a personality and a half , i love listening to his afternoon show over here in the usa and my only regret is that i will miss his new morning show .
lynne akom , usa i think sara cox and chris moyles are , broadly speaking , as talentless as each other .
empty-headed humour and meandering drivel a second time round will surely be the last thing to draw listeners back to radio 1 .
paul tester , uk sara cox is terrible , she just mutters nonsense .
moyles is alright , but i do n't think he 's 7am material .
colin & edith did a great job over the past few weeks - why not offer them it ?
dave , uk at last !
radio 1 has been unlistenable since cox took over the breakfast slot to delight us with her droning tales of ' getting wasted ' .
moyles ai n't exactly enlightenment but at least has enough of a spark of irony to tempt me back from radio 4 !
rich , uk moyles was obviously the first choice and good luck to the fella , my journeys to the office should be a little more bearable now !
spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks while coxy was ' on-leave ? '
keep up the good work you 2 , funny , quick and too good for rise ! !
ryan , uk it 's not just the djs it is more to do with the fact that the playlist clerks pick the most rubbish music to play and it 's all talk talk talk , if you wanted that you would tape newsnight and watch that in the morning - it would be more exciting carl , uk aww cmon , there 's far too many " moyles negative " statements here , however chris is indeed the saviour of ' afternoon ' radio , and should stay there .
matt , uk chris moyles is a talentless moron who seems to believe he 's god 's gift to radio .
he would do better on hospital radio - at least there he 'd have a captive audience .
angela b , uk i will be really sad to see sara go as she has brightened my mornings and made me able to face work with a smile !
i 'm glad that colin and edith are n't going to take over as i find them really boring .
i good luck in your new show sara - i for one will definitely be listening !
ceri h-j , uk i do think cox has lost her touch on the breakfast show and it is time she stepped down , but choosing chris moyles to replace her is not the best move radio 1 have made .
moyles style is not really suited to the morning slot , especially if he starts to shout and rant like he often does in the afternoon .
and his references to life in the ' 80s and early ' 90s would be lost on most of his younger audience .
in the afternoon slot he has a much older adult audience , and they appreciate his style and humour .
unlike the breakfast slot which seems to have a core audience of school kids and young adults on their way to work .
i do n't think they will get what moyles is about most of the time .
bring on colin and edith !
kate , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both as irritating to listen to as each other - jo whiley is the only decent daytime dj and if the breakfast slot is supposedly the most important would n't it make sense to tempt her there ? !
andrea , uk i thought sara cox was pretty good - she used to keep me sane during my monday morning drive along the m4 & round the m25 - and i 'm sure chris will be fine too .
but please get colin & edith off breakfast ! !
they 're the most annoying , predictable , brainless presenters i 've ever heard - they sound like they belong on some local commercial station -lrb- no offence commercial -rrb- .
i listen to radio 1 because it promotes quality , and colin & edith are definitely not .
plus they talk over the end of songs - far too eager to hear their own voices for my liking .
anyway , that 's my rant over ! !
jane , uk i 've really enjoyed waking up to sara in the mornings ¿ she makes me laugh .
i 've listened to the radio 1 breakfast show for over 20 years , but if chris moyles takes over then i 'll move to a different station .
if colin & edith take over , i 'll stay with radio 1 .
gill pitts , england who am i supposed to listen to on the drive home from work now ?
the local radio station in exeter is just about bearable in the morning , and i 've enjoyed chris moyles since he was on the late shift at capital fm .
he was the best antidote for a boring day at work , or a long afternoon drive back up to london for the weekend !
i certainly wo n't be tuning into sara cox 's afternoons - i ca n't stand her !
stephen , uk the difference between the two djs will be obvious when they swap : cox is annoying , uncharismatic and dim-witted , while moyles 's arrogance is only affected and his jokes tongue-in-cheek .
he 's no bully - he 's just having a laugh .
good decision bbc .
stuart , uk i discovered radio 2 because of sara cox and her mind-numbing breakfast show .
i never thought i 'd ever listen to radio 2 before the age of 40 -lrb- i 'm 27 -rrb- , but terry wogan & co do n't play gangsta rap - and therefore do n't try to pretend it 's cool - they do n't irritate me and terry is actually rather funny !
claire , england i have been one of the thousands of listeners to have turned over to another station in the morning .
i would have rather seen colin and edith replace coxy .
they are original and just what is needed for that time of day .
chris moyles should carry on in the afternoon .
why change a good thing ?
coxy seems to have run out of ideas and the bbc are only moving the problem .
chris , united kingdom what a bad , bad decision .
colin and edith , now that would bring me back to radio 1 in the mornings .
debbie sheppard , uk i think they 're both brilliant , so i will still listen to both .
they are the best two on the station by far , although i do like scott mills too .
i hope sara cox does n't get down about being dropped from the breakfast show .
i think she 's absolutely hilarious and very witty , but i suppose some people are a bit prudish and that 's why they may have stopped listening .
they ought to get real cos she tells it like it is !
big up to sara !

the move comes after months of speculation that cox was to be replaced following falling audiences .
cox will replace moyles as the host of the afternoon show of the bbc 's flagship pop music station .
" i am absolutely delighted that chris has agreed to host the new breakfast show , " said radio 1 controller andy parfitt on tuesday .
mr parfitt said moyles was his " only choice " as a replacement , adding that cox had done a " great job " over the last three and a half years .
" in a market that is getting more competitive by the month , i think chris is going to be just what our audience is looking for , " he said .
sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible bbc spokesman her successor profiled moyles said : " i am really chuffed - i 've said for ages that i am the saviour of radio 1 , now it looks i am finally going to have the chance to prove it ! "
cox said she had " a great time " doing the show - but the prospect of a lie-in was " extremely appealing " .
two months ago it was revealed that the breakfast show had lost 433,000 listeners in the space of a month , although it was still drawing an audience of 6.6 million .
at the time the bbc denied reports that cox was facing being dropped because of falling audience figures .
it described as " nonsense " a newspaper story suggesting she would be sacked if listener figures did not improve in the next 10 weeks , insisting radio 1 would keep cox on the show until the end of her contract in april .
a radio 1 spokesman told bbc news online on tuesday : " sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible .
" sara will remain at radio 1 on our drivetime show , and she remains a vital part of the radio 1 line-up . "
moyles has deputised for cox and her predecessor , zoe ball , on the breakfast show since he joined radio 1 in 1997 .
rising stars colin murray and edith bowman have also recently appeared on the show as stand-ins .
ball , who is now drivetime dj on london rock station xfm , said she was looking forward to some " friendly rivalry " with cox in her new time slot .
" she may be one of my best friends but if she thinks she 's going to be taking any of my xfm listeners , she can think again , " she said .
what do you think of the decision ?
please see below for a selection of your comments .
the reason that there is a lot of ' moyles negative ' statements on here is that a majority of people find him so annoying to listen to .
if he is the saviour of radio , then i 'd rather switch to tv !
paul smith , uk thank god - sara cox is the most irritating dj ever .
moyles is very good in the afternoon and i would have preferred him to stay there and scott mills to have taken the breakfast slot .
if it was felt that mills was n't up to this he should have been given the drivetime slot and sara cox finished completely .
pete , england trust the bbc to completely mis-understand the talents of their own presenters ! ! ! !
leave moyles where he is .
remember what happened to steve wright !
put colin & edith on in the morning and drop cox completely .
surely that was the way to go .
chris is brilliant in the afternoon and moving him to the morning , in my opinion , is not a wise idea .
colin & edith , however , have proved they have the energy and fun to make a morning show work .
i hope i 'm wrong , but i doubt it !
simon , uk how pleased i was to hear cox was leaving only to be downheartened by hearing she is taking over the afternoon slot .
her voice is like nails scraping down a blackboard .
please retire her before i rip out my radio from my car and throw it out of the window .
rebecca , uk once again the radio 1 bosses have mis-read their audience .
the reason for falling audience figures for the breakfast slot is the weakness of the show format : egos and in-jokes .
answer : bring in an ego who thrives on in-jokes .
at least colin and edith know the music !
simon , uk chris moyles is just soooo awful !
i switched to capital ages ago , despite the annoying advertising .
i like to listen to music on the radio when running in the morning - but not radio one .
scott mills is great and it is a shame he cant be on the breakfast slot .
michelle , uk cox was great .
colin and edith being on was the reason i stopped listening ! steve , uk shame .
i liked sara cox and found her amusing to listen to on my drive to work .
hope she will enjoy her new show and will tune in on my way home .
do n't like chris moyles though so will stick to local radio in the morning .
it is interesting to read all the comments here though !
chris , uk only a couple of these comments refer to the real problem - the music .
surely that 's why we listen to radio in the first place ?
radio one 's playlist is too limited and the same few songs get played to death before they 're even released .
pete , england chris moyles is the best dj .
its refreshing to have someone who is different from the rest .
glad its not scott mills who sounds just like a local radio dj , and colin and edith just talk over each other far too manically like they cant believe they are on radio 1 .
personally , i do n't mind sara .
both her and chris have a unique brand of humour which does n't fit with some people with a staid attitude .
frank , uk chris moyles ?
saviour of radio 1 ?
do n't think so ... his show is stewed , overcooked and basically - boring !
in the beginning his arrogant ramblings were kind of humorous , but as soon as i started preferring scott mills i knew that moyles had had his day .
yes ... you sometimes need a translator to understand sara cox , but at least she never let her own ego get in the way of the music , which often contained some little gems .
jo whiley , mark and lard followed by cox will be a good afternoon line up ... just get rid of dave pearce and send him and the moyles show into the depths of late night programming and radio 1 will be a better place .
this may be controversial but what about ant n dec for breakfast ?
chris , cardiff , wales this is the best news i 've heard all week !
i stopped listening to radio one over a year ago because of sara cox and am thrilled to hear that moyles has been handed the crown so will be returning to the fold one the change has taken place .
i wish chris the best of luck and hope that he does n't tone things down for the new time slot .
lori smith , manchester , uk chris moyles has the humour and spark needed to make the breakfast show a hit for radio 1 , my only grumble is they left sara cox on for so long when she is clearly not suited to breakfast radio .
ian , uk completely gutted !
sara cox made every morning that little bit more bearable - hilarious , down to earth and camper than a row of tents .
with chris moyles at the helm , radio 2 has never been more appealing !
mark , london , uk i think the chris moyles is definitely a backwards step .
a stepback to the 1980s with james whale-style programming .
why is someone whose supposed talent is based on ignorance , abuse and arrogance going to be the saviour of radio 1 ?
i think trusting the anchor for a full day 's scheduling with a character such as this is desperate and narrow-minded , and now is the time for the public to speak up .
raymond murray , uk i do n't think the swap is a good idea , chris moyles is far too fond of the sound of his own voice !
i do n't actually listen to the breakfast show as i think sarah cox does n't play a good mix of music , but i definitely wo n't be listening now .
i think the best man for the job is scott mills , he 's funny and the music is a good mix of everything .
lucie homer , uk i am a big fan of moyles , so i am a little disappointed at the news he is moving to the breakfast show .
i will only be able to listen to him for 15 minutes and imagine he would be annoying at that time of the day - cox certainly is .
however , i wish him the best of luck and i am sure he will raise the ratings .
mark , uk chris moyles is a talentless , unfunny , bitter and twisted dj , so why the bbc would put him on prime is a mystery to me .
i have never met anyone who can bear more than a minute of his obnoxious drivel .
russell b , uk go moylesy !
colin & edith are great too , they might have been my first choice , but anything 's better than sara cox .
the only reason i listen to radio 1 in the mornings at the moment is because i ca n't stand the ads on commercial radio and radio 4 is n't enough to wake me up !
jennie , england i think colin and edith should get the breakfast show and moyles should stay in the afternoon .
they have done a good job standing in and chris moyles seems to suit the afternoon slot .
also , i have more chance of listening to the radio in the pm when moyles is on !
chris , uk personally i think sara cox is wicked on the breakfast show and the reason i do n't currently listen to radio 1 during drive time is because i ca n't stand chris moyles !
maybe the drop in listeners is due to the fact that she has hardly presented during the last few months .
i do n't even listen when she is away !
kate gunn , england i have a choice between radio 1 and local radio on my way to work during breakfast and from work during chris moyles ' show .
moyles is an idiot and colin and edith totally ruin the breakfast show , because all three prefer their own voices to the music .
of chris , sara and colin and edith , only sara is worth listening to and i 'll be sticking to local radio from now on in .
ben taylor , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 mark fry , england thank god they 've seen the light of day and dropped sara cox ! !
it 's just a shame they 've replaced her with the equally annoying chris moyles - why could n't they have put colin and edith in breakfast slot permanently ?
kirsten , leeds , uk sara was the only bright spot in an otherwise increasingly awful programme .
the insultingly moronic " news " -lrb- aka latest bbc festival announcement -rrb- , the boring competitions and phone-ins , the terrible play-list and habit of playing certain songs every single morning for months and months ¿ surely these are the reasons for the drop in numbers .
if chris can change all this then the show might be in with a chance .
fiona , uk thank god sara cox is going .
the woman talks too fast and is n't funny . the move ca n't come to soon .
i think colin & edith would be better than chris moyles .
elaine freeman , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both well past their sell by date .
people do n't want to listen to them any more , that 's why audience figures are falling .
moving the schedules around wo n't change anything .
i tuned out of radio 1 months ago because i was sick of them both .
david , uk i think chris is best suited where he is .
colin and edith have filled in well during cox 's recent absences .
i must admit i have found a local radio station 's breakfast presenter a " better listen " in the mornings recently .
good luck sara , seems the tide has turned against you .
it 's a shame .
dave , uk i 've felt all along that moyles ' style was more suited to a breakfast slot , and would therefore be better than coxy , and finally , a bit too late for some , radio 1 make the switch .
at least this 'll mean coxy will be up against her mate zoe ball on xfm , which should be fun ...
stevie , england i ca n't think of a better bloke to wake up to in the morning ! !
he 'll be great .
sharon , uk no !
i ca n't believe coxy is leaving and i really ca n't believe moyles will take over- two dreadful decisions .
morag , uk i 'm only disappointed they are keeping her at all !
i am one of the many who have stopped listening to the breakfast show although to be fair , it was n't just because of the host , the music sucked too !
yan g , uk this is the biggest mistake radio 1 have ever made .
moving chris , fair enough .
putting cox on in the afternoon , the reason the show was loosing listeners was because of her .
what 's she going to do to the afternoon listening figures ?
oh well guess i 'll be listening to radio 2 all day now .
lee carter , uk i 'll be surprised if moyles manages to turn around the figures based on the fact that he 's the countries most irritating dj .
i 'll be finding a new radio station to listen to in the mornings .
james , uk i wake up to sara everyday and it 's the best start in the morning .
do n't replace her !
bobbi , uk to be honest i have been turning over stations in the morning drive to work once sara came on at 7am .
i will welcome chris moyles taking over but will miss him during my drive home from work .
jon baylis , wigan , uk .
i stopped listening to radio 1 when zoe ball left .
to hear that moyles is taking over is an improvement but still wo n't bring me back .
much prefer our local station heart fm .
kelly , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 , rather than kicked into the " talentless shouty person " bucket where she belongs .
mark fry , england i listen to radio 1 on the way to and from work .
i 'm glad to see that sara cox will no longer being irritating me in the mornings !
it 's just a pity that colin and edith are n't taking over the drive time show .
good luck to chris moyles !
laura , uk what a shame , i am a loyal listener to the moyles show which fits perfectly into the afternoon .
most people i assume that listen to moyles are travelling to work at that time in the morning , or still in bed .
he will be sorely missed at 3pm ! !
sarah , england the afternoon on radio one is the best around at the moment - mark and lard followed by chris moyles .
chris is one of the funniest djs on the radio at the moment and you can understand why bosses want to try him on their primetime slot to boost falling figures .
but will he lose his spark by having to make those early morning shows - especially with his reputation for having and odd drink or two ?
andrew lowe , uk chris is the only choice for the breakfast show , but putting sara in the prime spot in the afternoon may be a mistake .
we 'll just have to wait and see ...
rob spencer , england why on earth is chris moyles taking over the breakfast show ?
he is easily the worst dj on radio 1 , he and his sidekicks spend the entire show spouting nonsense which is no more entertaining than listening to five year old boys .
the last thing i want is to have to listen to that inane rubbish first thing in the morning .
no more radio 1 for me .
alan petrie , scotland what a great move !
chris moyles is brilliant , but why have they moved sara cox to drivetime ?
could they not just replace her with scott mills .
his position at radio 1 does not reflect his level of talent .
ian rawlins , england are you sure this is wise ?
chris moyles has n't done breakfast in years .
he used to be really good , but i remember steve wright being ace in the afternoon and a flop at breakfast ...
never got on with coxy , her voice is like nails down a blackboard - surely mills in the afternoon and letting her go would have been more attractive to the audience ?
dave cartwright , uk radio 1 have missed a serious trick with this move .
why keep someone if no one is listening .
why not give edith and colin the breakfast slot as they have proved to be best thing on radio 1 .
moyles is not funny and the prospect of listening to him first thing in the morning is frightening .
so long radio 1 i fear i will no longer be listening .
mike scruton , england moyles ?
looks like radio 2 for me on the road to work in the new year .
i thought edith and colin would have been a better choice .
andy , scotland i do n't think chris is a good choice for the breakfast slot , because he is to loud and ' in your face ' for that time of the morning .
greg o 'connell , uk bad move , chris is an arse , his show annoys me , his side-kicks are ok but chris ¿ selfish / offensive attitude stinks and is something you can do without first thing in the morning .
i usually switch to a local station in the afternoon , looks like i 'll be doing it in the morning now instead !
daheidsta , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
ian , uk at last !
time to re-tune my radio back to radio 1 .
bye bye coxy .
martin ross , uk chris moyles radio style is completely suited to the afternoon show , colin and edith should have been given the breakfast show .
i do n't see how sara can stay at radio 1 after the negative publicity .
mark smith , u.k from idiot to imbecile .
radio 1 is irrelevant .
techno techno handbag disco .
iain nicholson , uk could be a great swap .
sara often says she has to leave parties early because of her show .
this way we will now get all the gossip .
not much good for her liver though .
steve c , uk i 'm very sorry to hear sara is to be axed - i will be switching off when moyles takes over - if anyone should take over it should be scott mills - at least he has some intelligence .
jeane anderson , uk sara will be sorely missed on the breakfast show , i really enjoyed listening to her over the internet every morning while i was living in germany .
chris moyles is fine for a late afternoon show but i do n't think i could stomach him first thing in the morning !
caroline , uk if any dj on radio 1 can save the breakfast show , then it 's chris moyles .
not that i do n't like sara cox , but there has been a lack lustre to the whole morning show since chris evans left .
i for one will be tuning back in to hear it .
dave pigott , uk i will miss sara in a morning , she makes driving to work so much more enjoyable !
she 's absolutely hilarious and my favourite dj by far .
maybe it 's the northern sense of humour ...
i 'm really glad she 'll still be on radio 1 .
stephanie ainscough , blackpool , england i think radio 1 has made the right decision .
chris is a great presenter at any time of the day , but he now has to prove that he is the " saviour " of radio 1 , and work his magic on the breakfast slot ! !
trace , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
i listen to radio 1 avidly every weekday ; once on my way to work , once on the way home .
mornings were getting very irritating .
i guess now i should face irritating evenings instead .
colin and edith should be present in the new line up , they 're fresh , interesting and less vulgar .
ian , uk it 's bad enough listening to tiresome fart jokes in the afternoon .
who wants to listen to it first thing in the morning ?
moyles is a loud bully who thinks he 's the king of the celebrity social scene , and talks about little more than whatever reality show is currently on tv .
was that recent bbc talent search a failure ?
it would appear so .
angry from redhill , england radio 1 is losing daytime listeners , not because of the dj 's , but because of it 's inane and repetitive playlists that focus on the top 40 and so called popular artists , rather than offering a broad and cosmopolitan mix of music .
nigel , england about time too .
moyles should have got the show when zoe ball left .
i will be switching on to radio 1 in the morning and off during the afternoon .
dave , uk i am glad that radio 1 have dropped sara cox .
i was an avid morning listener before she arrived and am afraid i switched radio stations as i found her appalling .
fiona , uk yay ! about time .
glad to see her go .
bring on colin and edith ! ! ! susan , uk shame on radio one !
sara cox is the reason i started listening to radio 1 in the mornings again .
she is sexy , genuinely witty and well worth the licence fee .
chris moyles is the reason i turn over while driving home for the opposite reasons .
he is a poor man 's chris evans with only a fraction of the talent .
still , my homeward journey will be all the better in the company of ms cox !
karl , leeds , uk leave sara in her job , chris moyles sucks !
silvio , uk great , could n't listen to her from day one .
but i can thank her for pushing me over to radio five live .
try not to let her or moyles near five live .
nigel , england chris moyles is indeed the saviour of radio 1 .
it 's about time the bosses at radio 1 spread the age of the target audience group .
although in the early stages sara was appealing it soon changed to school radio .
for almost half of the days shows the target age group is in school or college and not driving to work finding local radio more appealing .
good luck to chris moyles jarv , uk spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks ryan , uk hooray !
one form of childishness to another !
matthew revell , wolverhampton , uk i think its the best decision that radio 1 have made for some years .
he 's the best on the radio and will be able to put everyone in good step for the rest of the day .
all they need to do now is swap mark and lard around with scott mills to create a super daytime line up !
richard , plymouth , england a long time coming .
well done chris .
see ya cox abs , uk hurrah !
best news ever !
i only ever listen to radio 1 when moyles is filling in because sara cox has had less and less to say over the past two years , now she rambles on in monotone .
sometimes i ca n't even hear what she 's saying because she mumbles so much .
hurrah for chris moyles in the morning to really wake me up !
lindsay , uk yaaaayyyyyy !
at last annoying " cox-ey " is out !
no more dull stories of her celebrity friends & what she did the night before .
i 'm so happy ! andy , uk thank god she 's going , i have always found her annoying .
chris is good and will be much better than sarah - but why not give it to colin & edith ?
when they have been standing in for sarah , they have been great and by far the most enjoyable djs to listen to .
nick , uk radio 1 are replacing one annoying person with another .
neither will make me tune back to the station in the morning .
they need someone who is n't grating first thing in the morning .
paul , uk thank god sara cox is probably the worst radio dj ever .
the only problem is now the drive home is going to be torture .
ca n't they just get rid of her completely darren rees , uk ca n't help but think that it will be like twins presenting the bbc breakfast shows with moyles on radio 1 and jupitus on 6 music chris gullick , newport , south wales not a moment too soon .
i live in south dorset where the commercial alternatives are non-existent and have had to put up with her crass noise for 3 1/2 years .
even this morning she made a comment after returning from a wedding anniversary break stating ' she might be walking funny ' .
how does a parent explain that to their children ?
colin and edith should have been given the slot - their recent breakfast shows have been funny and intelligent .
mark f , uk sometimes , after an undemanding day i can just about cope with moyles , his rants and his ' style ' of bullying his sidekicks .
so no , i wo n't be able to listen at 7am .
have we really got such a dearth of talent in this country that a sexist oaf is the only option ?
lisa , uk it really does n't matter who hosts the breakfast show on this redundant radio station that speaks to no-one about anything .
it has just shown further how out of touch with what people want and need parfitt is by giving the half-wit oaf moyles any further publicity .
the bbc should be ashamed of itself .
at least radio 2 has had the sense to get rid of edmonds after a short but still too long spell on drivetime. kath rice , uk i think chris moyles will be too overpowering first thing in the morning , sara and the team are a great start to the day .
kirsty , uk great choice and well overdue .
i was disappointed that chris moyles did n't take over from zoe ball when she left but now he is getting his chance .
he is a personality and a half , i love listening to his afternoon show over here in the usa and my only regret is that i will miss his new morning show .
lynne akom , usa i think sara cox and chris moyles are , broadly speaking , as talentless as each other .
empty-headed humour and meandering drivel a second time round will surely be the last thing to draw listeners back to radio 1 .
paul tester , uk sara cox is terrible , she just mutters nonsense .
moyles is alright , but i do n't think he 's 7am material .
colin & edith did a great job over the past few weeks - why not offer them it ?
dave , uk at last !
radio 1 has been unlistenable since cox took over the breakfast slot to delight us with her droning tales of ' getting wasted ' .
moyles ai n't exactly enlightenment but at least has enough of a spark of irony to tempt me back from radio 4 !
rich , uk moyles was obviously the first choice and good luck to the fella , my journeys to the office should be a little more bearable now !
spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks while coxy was ' on-leave ? '
keep up the good work you 2 , funny , quick and too good for rise ! !
ryan , uk it 's not just the djs it is more to do with the fact that the playlist clerks pick the most rubbish music to play and it 's all talk talk talk , if you wanted that you would tape newsnight and watch that in the morning - it would be more exciting carl , uk aww cmon , there 's far too many " moyles negative " statements here , however chris is indeed the saviour of ' afternoon ' radio , and should stay there .
matt , uk chris moyles is a talentless moron who seems to believe he 's god 's gift to radio .
he would do better on hospital radio - at least there he 'd have a captive audience .
angela b , uk i will be really sad to see sara go as she has brightened my mornings and made me able to face work with a smile !
i 'm glad that colin and edith are n't going to take over as i find them really boring .
i good luck in your new show sara - i for one will definitely be listening !
ceri h-j , uk i do think cox has lost her touch on the breakfast show and it is time she stepped down , but choosing chris moyles to replace her is not the best move radio 1 have made .
moyles style is not really suited to the morning slot , especially if he starts to shout and rant like he often does in the afternoon .
and his references to life in the ' 80s and early ' 90s would be lost on most of his younger audience .
in the afternoon slot he has a much older adult audience , and they appreciate his style and humour .
unlike the breakfast slot which seems to have a core audience of school kids and young adults on their way to work .
i do n't think they will get what moyles is about most of the time .
bring on colin and edith !
kate , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both as irritating to listen to as each other - jo whiley is the only decent daytime dj and if the breakfast slot is supposedly the most important would n't it make sense to tempt her there ? !
andrea , uk i thought sara cox was pretty good - she used to keep me sane during my monday morning drive along the m4 & round the m25 - and i 'm sure chris will be fine too .
but please get colin & edith off breakfast ! !
they 're the most annoying , predictable , brainless presenters i 've ever heard - they sound like they belong on some local commercial station -lrb- no offence commercial -rrb- .
i listen to radio 1 because it promotes quality , and colin & edith are definitely not .
plus they talk over the end of songs - far too eager to hear their own voices for my liking .
anyway , that 's my rant over ! !
jane , uk i 've really enjoyed waking up to sara in the mornings ¿ she makes me laugh .
i 've listened to the radio 1 breakfast show for over 20 years , but if chris moyles takes over then i 'll move to a different station .
if colin & edith take over , i 'll stay with radio 1 .
gill pitts , england who am i supposed to listen to on the drive home from work now ?
the local radio station in exeter is just about bearable in the morning , and i 've enjoyed chris moyles since he was on the late shift at capital fm .
he was the best antidote for a boring day at work , or a long afternoon drive back up to london for the weekend !
i certainly wo n't be tuning into sara cox 's afternoons - i ca n't stand her !
stephen , uk the difference between the two djs will be obvious when they swap : cox is annoying , uncharismatic and dim-witted , while moyles 's arrogance is only affected and his jokes tongue-in-cheek .
he 's no bully - he 's just having a laugh .
good decision bbc .
stuart , uk i discovered radio 2 because of sara cox and her mind-numbing breakfast show .
i never thought i 'd ever listen to radio 2 before the age of 40 -lrb- i 'm 27 -rrb- , but terry wogan & co do n't play gangsta rap - and therefore do n't try to pretend it 's cool - they do n't irritate me and terry is actually rather funny !
claire , england i have been one of the thousands of listeners to have turned over to another station in the morning .
i would have rather seen colin and edith replace coxy .
they are original and just what is needed for that time of day .
chris moyles should carry on in the afternoon .
why change a good thing ?
coxy seems to have run out of ideas and the bbc are only moving the problem .
chris , united kingdom what a bad , bad decision .
colin and edith , now that would bring me back to radio 1 in the mornings .
debbie sheppard , uk i think they 're both brilliant , so i will still listen to both .
they are the best two on the station by far , although i do like scott mills too .
i hope sara cox does n't get down about being dropped from the breakfast show .
i think she 's absolutely hilarious and very witty , but i suppose some people are a bit prudish and that 's why they may have stopped listening .
they ought to get real cos she tells it like it is !
big up to sara !
lizzy , uk e-mail this to a friend printable version vote who should host the radio 1 breakfast show ?

the move comes after months of speculation that cox was to be replaced following falling audiences .
cox will replace moyles as the host of the afternoon show of the bbc 's flagship pop music station .
" i am absolutely delighted that chris has agreed to host the new breakfast show , " said radio 1 controller andy parfitt on tuesday .
mr parfitt said moyles was his " only choice " as a replacement , adding that cox had done a " great job " over the last three and a half years .
" in a market that is getting more competitive by the month , i think chris is going to be just what our audience is looking for , " he said . "
sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible " bbc spokesman moyles said : " i am really chuffed - i 've said for ages that i am the saviour of radio 1 , now it looks i am finally going to have the chance to prove it ! "
cox said she had " a great time " doing the show - but the prospect of a lie-in was " extremely appealing " .
two months ago it was revealed that the breakfast show had lost 433,000 listeners in the space of a month , although it was still drawing an audience of 6.6 million .
at the time the bbc denied reports that cox was facing being dropped because of falling audience figures .
it described as " nonsense " a newspaper story suggesting she would be sacked if listener figures did not improve in the next 10 weeks , insisting radio 1 would keep cox on the show until the end of her contract in april .
a radio 1 spokesman told bbc news online on tuesday : " sara has been at the breakfast show for three-and-a-half years in an increasingly competitive environment , and we need to stay as competitive as possible .
" sara will remain at radio 1 on our drivetime show , and she remains a vital part of the radio 1 line-up . "
moyles has deputised for cox and her predecessor , zoe ball , on the breakfast show since he joined radio 1 in 1997 .
rising stars colin murray and edith bowman have also recently appeared on the show as stand-ins .
ball , who is now drivetime dj on london rock station xfm , said she was looking forward to some " friendly rivalry " with cox in her new time slot .
" she may be one of my best friends but if she thinks she 's going to be taking any of my xfm listeners , she can think again , " she said .
what do you think of the decision ?
please see below for a selection of your comments .
the reason that there is a lot of ' moyles negative ' statements on here is that a majority of people find him so annoying to listen to .
if he is the saviour of radio , then i 'd rather switch to tv !
paul smith , uk thank god - sara cox is the most irritating dj ever .
moyles is very good in the afternoon and i would have preferred him to stay there and scott mills to have taken the breakfast slot .
if it was felt that mills was n't up to this he should have been given the drivetime slot and sara cox finished completely .
pete , england trust the bbc to completely mis-understand the talents of their own presenters ! ! ! !
leave moyles where he is .
remember what happened to steve wright !
put colin & edith on in the morning and drop cox completely .
surely that was the way to go .
chris is brilliant in the afternoon and moving him to the morning , in my opinion , is not a wise idea .
colin & edith , however , have proved they have the energy and fun to make a morning show work .
i hope i 'm wrong , but i doubt it !
simon , uk how pleased i was to hear cox was leaving only to be downheartened by hearing she is taking over the afternoon slot .
her voice is like nails scraping down a blackboard .
please retire her before i rip out my radio from my car and throw it out of the window .
rebecca , uk once again the radio 1 bosses have mis-read their audience .
the reason for falling audience figures for the breakfast slot is the weakness of the show format : egos and in-jokes .
answer : bring in an ego who thrives on in-jokes .
at least colin and edith know the music !
simon , uk chris moyles is just soooo awful !
i switched to capital ages ago , despite the annoying advertising .
i like to listen to music on the radio when running in the morning - but not radio one .
scott mills is great and it is a shame he cant be on the breakfast slot .
michelle , uk cox was great .
colin and edith being on was the reason i stopped listening ! steve , uk shame .
i liked sara cox and found her amusing to listen to on my drive to work .
hope she will enjoy her new show and will tune in on my way home .
do n't like chris moyles though so will stick to local radio in the morning .
it is interesting to read all the comments here though !
chris , uk only a couple of these comments refer to the real problem - the music .
surely that 's why we listen to radio in the first place ?
radio one 's playlist is too limited and the same few songs get played to death before they 're even released .
pete , england chris moyles is the best dj .
its refreshing to have someone who is different from the rest .
glad its not scott mills who sounds just like a local radio dj , and colin and edith just talk over each other far too manically like they cant believe they are on radio 1 .
personally , i do n't mind sara .
both her and chris have a unique brand of humour which does n't fit with some people with a staid attitude .
frank , uk chris moyles ?
saviour of radio 1 ?
do n't think so ... his show is stewed , overcooked and basically - boring !
in the beginning his arrogant ramblings were kind of humorous , but as soon as i started preferring scott mills i knew that moyles had had his day .
yes ... you sometimes need a translator to understand sara cox , but at least she never let her own ego get in the way of the music , which often contained some little gems .
jo whiley , mark and lard followed by cox will be a good afternoon line up ... just get rid of dave pearce and send him and the moyles show into the depths of late night programming and radio 1 will be a better place .
this may be controversial but what about ant n dec for breakfast ?
chris , cardiff , wales this is the best news i 've heard all week !
i stopped listening to radio one over a year ago because of sara cox and am thrilled to hear that moyles has been handed the crown so will be returning to the fold one the change has taken place .
i wish chris the best of luck and hope that he does n't tone things down for the new time slot .
lori smith , manchester , uk chris moyles has the humour and spark needed to make the breakfast show a hit for radio 1 , my only grumble is they left sara cox on for so long when she is clearly not suited to breakfast radio .
ian , uk completely gutted !
sara cox made every morning that little bit more bearable - hilarious , down to earth and camper than a row of tents .
with chris moyles at the helm , radio 2 has never been more appealing !
mark , london , uk i think the chris moyles is definitely a backwards step .
a stepback to the 1980s with james whale-style programming .
why is someone whose supposed talent is based on ignorance , abuse and arrogance going to be the saviour of radio 1 ?
i think trusting the anchor for a full day 's scheduling with a character such as this is desperate and narrow-minded , and now is the time for the public to speak up .
raymond murray , uk i do n't think the swap is a good idea , chris moyles is far too fond of the sound of his own voice !
i do n't actually listen to the breakfast show as i think sarah cox does n't play a good mix of music , but i definitely wo n't be listening now .
i think the best man for the job is scott mills , he 's funny and the music is a good mix of everything .
lucie homer , uk i am a big fan of moyles , so i am a little disappointed at the news he is moving to the breakfast show .
i will only be able to listen to him for 15 minutes and imagine he would be annoying at that time of the day - cox certainly is .
however , i wish him the best of luck and i am sure he will raise the ratings .
mark , uk chris moyles is a talentless , unfunny , bitter and twisted dj , so why the bbc would put him on prime is a mystery to me .
i have never met anyone who can bear more than a minute of his obnoxious drivel .
russell b , uk go moylesy !
colin & edith are great too , they might have been my first choice , but anything 's better than sara cox .
the only reason i listen to radio 1 in the mornings at the moment is because i ca n't stand the ads on commercial radio and radio 4 is n't enough to wake me up !
jennie , england i think colin and edith should get the breakfast show and moyles should stay in the afternoon .
they have done a good job standing in and chris moyles seems to suit the afternoon slot .
also , i have more chance of listening to the radio in the pm when moyles is on !
chris , uk personally i think sara cox is wicked on the breakfast show and the reason i do n't currently listen to radio 1 during drive time is because i ca n't stand chris moyles !
maybe the drop in listeners is due to the fact that she has hardly presented during the last few months .
i do n't even listen when she is away !
kate gunn , england i have a choice between radio 1 and local radio on my way to work during breakfast and from work during chris moyles ' show .
moyles is an idiot and colin and edith totally ruin the breakfast show , because all three prefer their own voices to the music .
of chris , sara and colin and edith , only sara is worth listening to and i 'll be sticking to local radio from now on in .
ben taylor , uk " about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 " mark fry , england thank god they 've seen the light of day and dropped sara cox ! !
it 's just a shame they 've replaced her with the equally annoying chris moyles - why could n't they have put colin and edith in breakfast slot permanently ?
kirsten , leeds , uk sara was the only bright spot in an otherwise increasingly awful programme .
the insultingly moronic " news " -lrb- aka latest bbc festival announcement -rrb- , the boring competitions and phone-ins , the terrible play-list and habit of playing certain songs every single morning for months and months ¿ surely these are the reasons for the drop in numbers .
if chris can change all this then the show might be in with a chance .
fiona , uk thank god sara cox is going .
the woman talks too fast and is n't funny . the move ca n't come to soon .
i think colin & edith would be better than chris moyles .
elaine freeman , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both well past their sell by date .
people do n't want to listen to them any more , that 's why audience figures are falling .
moving the schedules around wo n't change anything .
i tuned out of radio 1 months ago because i was sick of them both .
david , uk i think chris is best suited where he is .
colin and edith have filled in well during cox 's recent absences .
i must admit i have found a local radio station 's breakfast presenter a " better listen " in the mornings recently .
good luck sara , seems the tide has turned against you .
it 's a shame .
dave , uk i 've felt all along that moyles ' style was more suited to a breakfast slot , and would therefore be better than coxy , and finally , a bit too late for some , radio 1 make the switch .
at least this 'll mean coxy will be up against her mate zoe ball on xfm , which should be fun ...
stevie , england i ca n't think of a better bloke to wake up to in the morning ! !
he 'll be great .
sharon , uk no !
i ca n't believe coxy is leaving and i really ca n't believe moyles will take over- two dreadful decisions .
morag , uk i 'm only disappointed they are keeping her at all !
i am one of the many who have stopped listening to the breakfast show although to be fair , it was n't just because of the host , the music sucked too !
yan g , uk this is the biggest mistake radio 1 have ever made .
moving chris , fair enough .
putting cox on in the afternoon , the reason the show was loosing listeners was because of her .
what 's she going to do to the afternoon listening figures ?
oh well guess i 'll be listening to radio 2 all day now .
lee carter , uk i 'll be surprised if moyles manages to turn around the figures based on the fact that he 's the countries most irritating dj .
i 'll be finding a new radio station to listen to in the mornings .
james , uk i wake up to sara everyday and it 's the best start in the morning .
do n't replace her !
bobbi , uk to be honest i have been turning over stations in the morning drive to work once sara came on at 7am .
i will welcome chris moyles taking over but will miss him during my drive home from work .
jon baylis , wigan , uk .
i stopped listening to radio 1 when zoe ball left .
to hear that moyles is taking over is an improvement but still wo n't bring me back .
much prefer our local station heart fm .
kelly , uk about two years too late .
only a shame she 's been given another show on radio 1 , rather than kicked into the " talentless shouty person " bucket where she belongs .
mark fry , england i listen to radio 1 on the way to and from work .
i 'm glad to see that sara cox will no longer being irritating me in the mornings !
it 's just a pity that colin and edith are n't taking over the drive time show .
good luck to chris moyles !
laura , uk what a shame , i am a loyal listener to the moyles show which fits perfectly into the afternoon .
most people i assume that listen to moyles are travelling to work at that time in the morning , or still in bed .
he will be sorely missed at 3pm ! !
sarah , england the afternoon on radio one is the best around at the moment - mark and lard followed by chris moyles .
chris is one of the funniest djs on the radio at the moment and you can understand why bosses want to try him on their primetime slot to boost falling figures .
but will he lose his spark by having to make those early morning shows - especially with his reputation for having and odd drink or two ?
andrew lowe , uk chris is the only choice for the breakfast show , but putting sara in the prime spot in the afternoon may be a mistake .
we 'll just have to wait and see ...
rob spencer , england why on earth is chris moyles taking over the breakfast show ?
he is easily the worst dj on radio 1 , he and his sidekicks spend the entire show spouting nonsense which is no more entertaining than listening to five year old boys .
the last thing i want is to have to listen to that inane rubbish first thing in the morning .
no more radio 1 for me .
alan petrie , scotland what a great move !
chris moyles is brilliant , but why have they moved sara cox to drivetime ?
could they not just replace her with scott mills .
his position at radio 1 does not reflect his level of talent .
ian rawlins , england are you sure this is wise ?
chris moyles has n't done breakfast in years .
he used to be really good , but i remember steve wright being ace in the afternoon and a flop at breakfast ...
never got on with coxy , her voice is like nails down a blackboard - surely mills in the afternoon and letting her go would have been more attractive to the audience ?
dave cartwright , uk radio 1 have missed a serious trick with this move .
why keep someone if no one is listening .
why not give edith and colin the breakfast slot as they have proved to be best thing on radio 1 .
moyles is not funny and the prospect of listening to him first thing in the morning is frightening .
so long radio 1 i fear i will no longer be listening .
mike scruton , england moyles ?
looks like radio 2 for me on the road to work in the new year .
i thought edith and colin would have been a better choice .
andy , scotland i do n't think chris is a good choice for the breakfast slot , because he is to loud and ' in your face ' for that time of the morning .
greg o 'connell , uk bad move , chris is an arse , his show annoys me , his side-kicks are ok but chris ¿ selfish / offensive attitude stinks and is something you can do without first thing in the morning .
i usually switch to a local station in the afternoon , looks like i 'll be doing it in the morning now instead !
daheidsta , uk " if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ? "
ian , uk at last !
time to re-tune my radio back to radio 1 .
bye bye coxy .
martin ross , uk chris moyles radio style is completely suited to the afternoon show , colin and edith should have been given the breakfast show .
i do n't see how sara can stay at radio 1 after the negative publicity .
mark smith , u.k from idiot to imbecile .
radio 1 is irrelevant .
techno techno handbag disco .
iain nicholson , uk could be a great swap .
sara often says she has to leave parties early because of her show .
this way we will now get all the gossip .
not much good for her liver though .
steve c , uk i 'm very sorry to hear sara is to be axed - i will be switching off when moyles takes over - if anyone should take over it should be scott mills - at least he has some intelligence .
jeane anderson , uk sara will be sorely missed on the breakfast show , i really enjoyed listening to her over the internet every morning while i was living in germany .
chris moyles is fine for a late afternoon show but i do n't think i could stomach him first thing in the morning !
caroline , uk if any dj on radio 1 can save the breakfast show , then it 's chris moyles .
not that i do n't like sara cox , but there has been a lack lustre to the whole morning show since chris evans left .
i for one will be tuning back in to hear it .
dave pigott , uk i will miss sara in a morning , she makes driving to work so much more enjoyable !
she 's absolutely hilarious and my favourite dj by far .
maybe it 's the northern sense of humour ...
i 'm really glad she 'll still be on radio 1 .
stephanie ainscough , blackpool , england i think radio 1 has made the right decision .
chris is a great presenter at any time of the day , but he now has to prove that he is the " saviour " of radio 1 , and work his magic on the breakfast slot ! !
trace , uk if sara has lost listeners in the morning wo n't she now do just the same in the drive time slot ?
i listen to radio 1 avidly every weekday ; once on my way to work , once on the way home .
mornings were getting very irritating .
i guess now i should face irritating evenings instead .
colin and edith should be present in the new line up , they 're fresh , interesting and less vulgar .
ian , uk it 's bad enough listening to tiresome fart jokes in the afternoon .
who wants to listen to it first thing in the morning ?
moyles is a loud bully who thinks he 's the king of the celebrity social scene , and talks about little more than whatever reality show is currently on tv .
was that recent bbc talent search a failure ?
it would appear so .
angry from redhill , england radio 1 is losing daytime listeners , not because of the dj 's , but because of it 's inane and repetitive playlists that focus on the top 40 and so called popular artists , rather than offering a broad and cosmopolitan mix of music .
nigel , england about time too .
moyles should have got the show when zoe ball left .
i will be switching on to radio 1 in the morning and off during the afternoon .
dave , uk i am glad that radio 1 have dropped sara cox .
i was an avid morning listener before she arrived and am afraid i switched radio stations as i found her appalling .
fiona , uk yay ! about time .
glad to see her go .
bring on colin and edith ! ! ! susan , uk shame on radio one !
sara cox is the reason i started listening to radio 1 in the mornings again .
she is sexy , genuinely witty and well worth the licence fee .
chris moyles is the reason i turn over while driving home for the opposite reasons .
he is a poor man 's chris evans with only a fraction of the talent .
still , my homeward journey will be all the better in the company of ms cox !
karl , leeds , uk leave sara in her job , chris moyles sucks !
silvio , uk great , could n't listen to her from day one .
but i can thank her for pushing me over to radio five live .
try not to let her or moyles near five live .
nigel , england chris moyles is indeed the saviour of radio 1 .
it 's about time the bosses at radio 1 spread the age of the target audience group .
although in the early stages sara was appealing it soon changed to school radio .
for almost half of the days shows the target age group is in school or college and not driving to work finding local radio more appealing .
good luck to chris moyles jarv , uk " spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks " ryan , uk hooray !
one form of childishness to another !
matthew revell , wolverhampton , uk i think its the best decision that radio 1 have made for some years .
he 's the best on the radio and will be able to put everyone in good step for the rest of the day .
all they need to do now is swap mark and lard around with scott mills to create a super daytime line up !
richard , plymouth , england a long time coming .
well done chris .
see ya cox abs , uk hurrah !
best news ever !
i only ever listen to radio 1 when moyles is filling in because sara cox has had less and less to say over the past two years , now she rambles on in monotone .
sometimes i ca n't even hear what she 's saying because she mumbles so much .
hurrah for chris moyles in the morning to really wake me up !
lindsay , uk yaaaayyyyyy !
at last annoying " cox-ey " is out !
no more dull stories of her celebrity friends & what she did the night before .
i 'm so happy ! andy , uk thank god she 's going , i have always found her annoying .
chris is good and will be much better than sarah - but why not give it to colin & edith ?
when they have been standing in for sarah , they have been great and by far the most enjoyable djs to listen to .
nick , uk radio 1 are replacing one annoying person with another .
neither will make me tune back to the station in the morning .
they need someone who is n't grating first thing in the morning .
paul , uk thank god sara cox is probably the worst radio dj ever .
the only problem is now the drive home is going to be torture .
ca n't they just get rid of her completely darren rees , uk ca n't help but think that it will be like twins presenting the bbc breakfast shows with moyles on radio 1 and jupitus on 6 music chris gullick , newport , south wales not a moment too soon .
i live in south dorset where the commercial alternatives are non-existent and have had to put up with her crass noise for 3 1/2 years .
even this morning she made a comment after returning from a wedding anniversary break stating ' she might be walking funny ' .
how does a parent explain that to their children ?
colin and edith should have been given the slot - their recent breakfast shows have been funny and intelligent .
mark f , uk sometimes , after an undemanding day i can just about cope with moyles , his rants and his ' style ' of bullying his sidekicks .
so no , i wo n't be able to listen at 7am .
have we really got such a dearth of talent in this country that a sexist oaf is the only option ?
lisa , uk it really does n't matter who hosts the breakfast show on this redundant radio station that speaks to no-one about anything .
it has just shown further how out of touch with what people want and need parfitt is by giving the half-wit oaf moyles any further publicity .
the bbc should be ashamed of itself .
at least radio 2 has had the sense to get rid of edmonds after a short but still too long spell on drivetime. kath rice , uk i think chris moyles will be too overpowering first thing in the morning , sara and the team are a great start to the day .
kirsty , uk great choice and well overdue .
i was disappointed that chris moyles did n't take over from zoe ball when she left but now he is getting his chance .
he is a personality and a half , i love listening to his afternoon show over here in the usa and my only regret is that i will miss his new morning show .
lynne akom , usa i think sara cox and chris moyles are , broadly speaking , as talentless as each other .
empty-headed humour and meandering drivel a second time round will surely be the last thing to draw listeners back to radio 1 .
paul tester , uk sara cox is terrible , she just mutters nonsense .
moyles is alright , but i do n't think he 's 7am material .
colin & edith did a great job over the past few weeks - why not offer them it ?
dave , uk at last !
radio 1 has been unlistenable since cox took over the breakfast slot to delight us with her droning tales of ' getting wasted ' .
moyles ai n't exactly enlightenment but at least has enough of a spark of irony to tempt me back from radio 4 !
rich , uk moyles was obviously the first choice and good luck to the fella , my journeys to the office should be a little more bearable now !
spare a thought for colin and edith however , who i feel have done a cracking job in the past few weeks while coxy was ' on-leave ? '
keep up the good work you 2 , funny , quick and too good for rise ! !
ryan , uk it 's not just the djs it is more to do with the fact that the playlist clerks pick the most rubbish music to play and it 's all talk talk talk , if you wanted that you would tape newsnight and watch that in the morning - it would be more exciting carl , uk aww cmon , there 's far too many " moyles negative " statements here , however chris is indeed the saviour of ' afternoon ' radio , and should stay there .
matt , uk chris moyles is a talentless moron who seems to believe he 's god 's gift to radio .
he would do better on hospital radio - at least there he 'd have a captive audience .
angela b , uk i will be really sad to see sara go as she has brightened my mornings and made me able to face work with a smile !
i 'm glad that colin and edith are n't going to take over as i find them really boring .
i good luck in your new show sara - i for one will definitely be listening !
ceri h-j , uk i do think cox has lost her touch on the breakfast show and it is time she stepped down , but choosing chris moyles to replace her is not the best move radio 1 have made .
moyles style is not really suited to the morning slot , especially if he starts to shout and rant like he often does in the afternoon .
and his references to life in the ' 80s and early ' 90s would be lost on most of his younger audience .
in the afternoon slot he has a much older adult audience , and they appreciate his style and humour .
unlike the breakfast slot which seems to have a core audience of school kids and young adults on their way to work .
i do n't think they will get what moyles is about most of the time .
bring on colin and edith !
kate , uk sara cox and chris moyles are both as irritating to listen to as each other - jo whiley is the only decent daytime dj and if the breakfast slot is supposedly the most important would n't it make sense to tempt her there ? !
andrea , uk i thought sara cox was pretty good - she used to keep me sane during my monday morning drive along the m4 & round the m25 - and i 'm sure chris will be fine too .
but please get colin & edith off breakfast ! !
they 're the most annoying , predictable , brainless presenters i 've ever heard - they sound like they belong on some local commercial station -lrb- no offence commercial -rrb- .
i listen to radio 1 because it promotes quality , and colin & edith are definitely not .
plus they talk over the end of songs - far too eager to hear their own voices for my liking .
anyway , that 's my rant over ! !
jane , uk i 've really enjoyed waking up to sara in the mornings ¿ she makes me laugh .
i 've listened to the radio 1 breakfast show for over 20 years , but if chris moyles takes over then i 'll move to a different station .
if colin & edith take over , i 'll stay with radio 1 .
gill pitts , england who am i supposed to listen to on the drive home from work now ?
the local radio station in exeter is just about bearable in the morning , and i 've enjoyed chris moyles since he was on the late shift at capital fm .
he was the best antidote for a boring day at work , or a long afternoon drive back up to london for the weekend !
i certainly wo n't be tuning into sara cox 's afternoons - i ca n't stand her !
stephen , uk the difference between the two djs will be obvious when they swap : cox is annoying , uncharismatic and dim-witted , while moyles 's arrogance is only affected and his jokes tongue-in-cheek .
he 's no bully - he 's just having a laugh .
good decision bbc .
stuart , uk i discovered radio 2 because of sara cox and her mind-numbing breakfast show .
i never thought i 'd ever listen to radio 2 before the age of 40 -lrb- i 'm 27 -rrb- , but terry wogan & co do n't play gangsta rap - and therefore do n't try to pretend it 's cool - they do n't irritate me and terry is actually rather funny !
claire , england i have been one of the thousands of listeners to have turned over to another station in the morning .
i would have rather seen colin and edith replace coxy .
they are original and just what is needed for that time of day .
chris moyles should carry on in the afternoon .
why change a good thing ?
coxy seems to have run out of ideas and the bbc are only moving the problem .
chris , united kingdom what a bad , bad decision .
colin and edith , now that would bring me back to radio 1 in the mornings .
debbie sheppard , uk i think they 're both brilliant , so i will still listen to both .
they are the best two on the station by far , although i do like scott mills too .
i hope sara cox does n't get down about being dropped from the breakfast show .
i think she 's absolutely hilarious and very witty , but i suppose some people are a bit prudish and that 's why they may have stopped listening .
they ought to get real cos she tells it like it is !
big up to sara !
