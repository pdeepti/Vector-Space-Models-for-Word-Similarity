but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .

later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .

" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

2000 .
trotz grosser fortschritte , vor allem in polen , sieht verheugen bei keinem kandidatenland bereits die fuer den beitritt zur europaeischen union notwendige reife , sagte verheugen am dienstag , 20 .
feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.02.2003 instant aging with a wearable time machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feel like 70 already ?
a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .

2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.02.2003 instant aging with a wearable time machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feel like 70 already ?
a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .

after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .
memories of the warsaw pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , and now the eu tells us what we should think and say , " he said .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .
it could only become serious for the bank if a settlement with kirch is much larger than anticipated , traders said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire .
timeline of a downfall the eleventh-hour fight to save kirch group , drowning in debt , began in earnest in december 2001 but ended only five months later .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 humanitarian organizations prepare for war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid agencies are readying themselves for the human costs of a war in iraq .
germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?
often there is very little understanding of the completely different culture in these countries . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links international red cross - site in english 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .
memories of the warsaw pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , and now the eu tells us what we should think and say , " he said .
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .

during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .

this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 chirac comments send a jolt through eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the u.s. : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder french president jacques chirac had a few words of advice for countries about to join the european union .
in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

trotz grosser fortschritte , vor allem in polen , sieht verheugen bei keinem kandidatenland bereits die fuer den beitritt zur europaeischen union notwendige reife , sagte verheugen am dienstag , 20 .
feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .

-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .

chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .

chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.02.2003 deutsche bank chief loses in battle of corporate giants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's rolf breuer : guilty as charged a munich court has ruled that deutsche bank executive rolf breuer is liable for public comments he made in 2002 on the financial health of the kirch media group .
damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .
it could only become serious for the bank if a settlement with kirch is much larger than anticipated , traders said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 humanitarian organizations prepare for war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid agencies are readying themselves for the human costs of a war in iraq .
germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?
often there is very little understanding of the completely different culture in these countries . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links international red cross - site in english 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .

commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .

-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 humanitarian organizations prepare for war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid agencies are readying themselves for the human costs of a war in iraq .
germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .

in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong criticism of eu candidates : french president jacques chirac at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .
but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .

later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .

" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .
it could only become serious for the bank if a settlement with kirch is much larger than anticipated , traders said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.02.2003 instant aging with a wearable time machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feel like 70 already ?
a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 humanitarian organizations prepare for war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid agencies are readying themselves for the human costs of a war in iraq .
germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?
often there is very little understanding of the completely different culture in these countries . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links international red cross - site in english 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : expansion in focus image is everything for the eu adding ten more storeys to the eu ’ s tower of babel paying -lrb- a lot -rrb- for eu membership eu finds common ground on iraq current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 chirac ruffles eu feathers with tirade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unity in diversity ? - the headquarters of the european commission in brussels french president chirac 's controversial comments directed towards eu candidate countries have sparked much debate within the eu , with some officials evoking memories of the historical warsaw pact . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members .
but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .
memories of the warsaw pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , and now the eu tells us what we should think and say , " he said .
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .
but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.02.2003 instant aging with a wearable time machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feel like 70 already ?
a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .

" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .
memories of the warsaw pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , and now the eu tells us what we should think and say , " he said .
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 humanitarian organizations prepare for war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid agencies are readying themselves for the human costs of a war in iraq .
germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?
often there is very little understanding of the completely different culture in these countries . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links international red cross - site in english 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 chirac comments send a jolt through eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics of the u.s. : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder french president jacques chirac had a few words of advice for countries about to join the european union .
in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.02.2003 instant aging with a wearable time machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feel like 70 already ?
a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong criticism of eu candidates : french president jacques chirac at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .
but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?
often there is very little understanding of the completely different culture in these countries . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links international red cross - site in english 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .
it could only become serious for the bank if a settlement with kirch is much larger than anticipated , traders said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire .

since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .

-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .

" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .
it could only become serious for the bank if a settlement with kirch is much larger than anticipated , traders said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?
often there is very little understanding of the completely different culture in these countries . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links international red cross - site in english 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .
it could only become serious for the bank if a settlement with kirch is much larger than anticipated , traders said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : expansion in focus image is everything for the eu adding ten more storeys to the eu ’ s tower of babel paying -lrb- a lot -rrb- for eu membership eu finds common ground on iraq current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 chirac ruffles eu feathers with tirade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unity in diversity ? - the headquarters of the european commission in brussels french president chirac 's controversial comments directed towards eu candidate countries have sparked much debate within the eu , with some officials evoking memories of the historical warsaw pact . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members .
but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .
memories of the warsaw pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , and now the eu tells us what we should think and say , " he said .
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .
but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?
often there is very little understanding of the completely different culture in these countries . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links international red cross - site in english 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong criticism of eu candidates : french president jacques chirac at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .
but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .

several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , and now the eu tells us what we should think and say , " he said .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

trotz grosser fortschritte , vor allem in polen , sieht verheugen bei keinem kandidatenland bereits die fuer den beitritt zur europaeischen union notwendige reife , sagte verheugen am dienstag , 20 .
feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu-kommissar fuer osterweiterung guenter verheugen bei einer pressekonferenz in warschau am 23 .

trotz grosser fortschritte , vor allem in polen , sieht verheugen bei keinem kandidatenland bereits die fuer den beitritt zur europaeischen union notwendige reife , sagte verheugen am dienstag , 20 .
feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .

since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

trotz grosser fortschritte , vor allem in polen , sieht verheugen bei keinem kandidatenland bereits die fuer den beitritt zur europaeischen union notwendige reife , sagte verheugen am dienstag , 20 .
feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .

chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .

but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .

this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 guilty verdict in hamburg terror trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq is the first convicted terrorist with ties to sept .
11 judges in a hamburg court on wednesday convicted mounir el motassadeq of at least four charges in the world 's first trial relating to the sept .
11 , 2001 , terror attacks on new york and washington . the judges of hamburg 's higher regional court sentenced mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan student , to 15 years in prison on at least four charges including accessory to murder in 3,045 cases , membership in a terrorist organization , attempted murder and five cases of causing grievous bodily injury .
the trial had been a test case for prosecutors pursuing terrorists with suspected ties to the sept .
11 terror attacks .
in the days leading up to the end of the trial , defense attorneys had been calling for their client 's acquittal .
but on wednesday , chief judge albrecht metz sided with the prosecution saying they had proven that 28-year-old motassadeq had participated in the planning of the attacks and had been a member of the hamburg terror cell that planned and carried them out .
during the trial , prosecutors sought to prove that motassadeq was the group 's treasurer , managing bank accounts for members of the terror cell and covering their tracks .
piecing together witness testimony and law enforcement investigation reports , chief prosecutor walter hemberger revealed a mosaic of evidence demonstrating that motassadeq was deeply integrated into the terror cell led by mohammed atta , one of the sept .
11 hijackers .
bits and pieces of evidence however , testimony from nearly 30 witnesses failed to prove beyond a doubt that the plaintiff was aware of his friends ’ plans or that he supported them .
still , the judges found enough evidence to convict him .
motassadeq admitted that marwan al shehhi - who later flew a jet into the world trade center - authorized him to access his bank account .
in his absence , motassadeq paid bills for al shehhi , registered him at the university and liquidated his apartment .
in september 2000 , motassadeq transferred money from the account to ramzi binalshibh , who is alleged to have been the main contact point between the hamburg cell and al qaeda .
the transaction was intended to pay for al shehhi ’ s flight lessons .
besides al shehhi , motassadeq also knew mohammed atta and ziad jarrah , all friends in the same hamburg terror cell before they hijacked the planes that crashed into the world trade center and in pennsylvania .
prosecutors sought to show that motassadeq ’ s religious beliefs became more radical with time .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .
while deutsche bank stocks fell slightly after the ruling became public , bond investors seemed to largely shrug off the news .
it could only become serious for the bank if a settlement with kirch is much larger than anticipated , traders said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leo kirch seeks to settle score with springer the beleaguered media mogul blames long-standing rival axel springer verlag for setting off the chain of events that brought down his empire .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

trotz grosser fortschritte , vor allem in polen , sieht verheugen bei keinem kandidatenland bereits die fuer den beitritt zur europaeischen union notwendige reife , sagte verheugen am dienstag , 20 .
feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .
" at first it was funny in a way , like you 're in some kind of halloween costume , " said lisa neundorfer , a marketing researcher who has tried out the suit .
" but then you realize how cut off you are from your environment .
suddenly you have a whole new perspective on things . "
changing demographic the age explorer is more than just a strange toy to encourage inter-generational understanding , it is also a tool for business , allowing marketers and product developers to get a feel for the experiences and limitations of the elderly , a market which is growing by leaps and bounds .
while 10 percent of the world 's population is now over 60 , according to a united nations forecast , that percentage is expected to grow to 22 percent within the next two decades .
in germany , a country with one of the lowest birthrates in the western world at just 1.3 children per woman , the population is graying at rapid pace .
in 30 years , demographers predict one-half of the german populace will be over 50 years old .
the buying power of this segment of the population in also on the increase and discretionary income is highest in the over-50 group .
companies are slowly starting to realize that the senior market is soon to be a very lucrative one .
" the baby boomers are geting older and they are very important for the economy because they have the money and they want to consume , " said vera heuser of the german direct marketing association , which has carried out studies about the demographic changes going on in germany .
it makes sense for companies to understand members of the senior population if they want to develop product and services that are appropriate for them .
" however , usually people in adverstising or marketing are very young , so they can not imagine how it feels if you are older and what kinds of problems older people have , " said heuser .
she cites the tiny buttons on cellular phones or the increasingly complexity of video recorders as the kinds of product features that make them largely inaccessible to older people .
new understanding for grandma the age explorer aims to change that .
hanna meyer-hentschel began developing it with the help of gerontologists after a swiss firm asked for advice on making its shops more accessible to the elderly .
now meyer-hentschel says more and more companies , such as car and appliance makers or travel companies , are sending their young hotshots to get a taste of what life 's like for grandma and grandpa .
her company is working on the third generation of the suit which takes age simulation to the next step .
age explorer iii will be able to mimic certain mental conditions among the elderly , like confusion or interrupted thought processes .
put enough people into the thing , according to one wearer , and it might just spark a renewed hunt for the legendary fountain of youth . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

damages could run into hundreds of millions of euros . the case pitted germany 's largest bank against the country 's one-time most powerful media conglomerate , which last year collapsed into ruins .
according to kirch 's founder and head , leo kirch , it was rolf breuer - former deutsche bank chairman and current supervisory board head - and his comments made in a television interview last year , which caused the downfall .
in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to leo kirch -lrb- photo -rrb- , breuer 's comments helped precipitate the collapse of his media empire and amounted to a serious betrayal of business secrets as well as an unauthorized disclosure of the kirch group 's credit lines .
kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .
" we are convinced that the judgement is flawed in several respects , " peter heckel , lawyer for deutsche bank , told reuters .
" we are still confident of the final conclusion . "
several german legal experts said they were surprised by the court 's ruling and predicted the chances were good that deutsch bank would see it overturned on appeal .
bad week for deutsche bank the judgement against the german banking giant comes just two days after prosecutors in düsseldorf charged management board head josef ackermann of breaching shareholders ' trust by awarding excessive payoffs to managers of telecommunications company mannesmann when it was bought by vodaphone in 2000 .
ackermann was a member of the mannesmann supervisory board at the time .
if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .
he became a symbol of corporate germany 's transformation in the 1990s , when the country 's banks broke with tradition and showed reluctance to bail out large companies in trouble .

in the interview with bloomberg television in february 2002 , breuer had questioned the the financial stability of the kirch group , which was buckling at the time under a massive debt load and looking for ways to pay its creditors .

kirch opened proceedings against breuer in may , suing him and deutsche bank for € 100 million , saying breuer 's comments had caused other banks to refuse him badly needed credit to stave off insolvency .
on tuesday , a munich judge sided with kirch , ruling that breuer is liable for his statements and should pay damages .
the court said it would rule on the amount of compensation at a later date .
sources close to kirch said he could raise his damage claims to " more realistic " levels " that could reach into the billions .
" death blow " kirch 's lawyers argued in front of the court that breuer 's statements constituted a " death blow " for the then-struggling media empire , which has since gone into insolvency .
breuer had been asked in the interview two months before the kirch insolvency , whether banks were willing to come to the aid of the struggling media group .
" what one is reading and hearing is that the financial sector is not prepared to supply further funds or outside resources , " breuer said at the time .
that , according to judge helmut lieber , was a clear offense against confidentiality agreements between client and bank .
for their part , deutsche bank 's lawyers argued that breuer 's comments contained nothing that was not already widely known in the financial community .
they have vowed to appeal .

if tuesday 's ruling is upheld , it could signal the end of breuer 's high-profile career in german banking .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

trotz grosser fortschritte , vor allem in polen , sieht verheugen bei keinem kandidatenland bereits die fuer den beitritt zur europaeischen union notwendige reife , sagte verheugen am dienstag , 20 .
feb .
2001 , in schwerin .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in reaction , some officials are talking about the warsaw pact again . wednesday 's trip to poland was a routine matter for irish foreign minister brian cowen , part of a series of visits irish leaders are making to current and future european union members . but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on the fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with chirac .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact , the dead soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .

trotz grosser fortschritte , vor allem in polen , sieht verheugen bei keinem kandidatenland bereits die fuer den beitritt zur europaeischen union notwendige reife , sagte verheugen am dienstag , 20 .

-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- -zu apd6034- günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the argument over chirac 's comments was the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , a matter that france and germany are working to stop .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be taken in mind in all political statements . "
gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make good , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap said in an interview with dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the usa too fast , " she said .
in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , " he said .
" and now the eu tells us what we should think and say . "
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .

but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .
by speaking out , chirac may have been trying to teach them a lesson , apap told dw-world .
" he was urging them to conform to the eu and not follow the u.s. too fast , " she said .
memories of the warsaw pact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen in the newspaper interview , verheugen also put the eastern european support into a historic perspective .
several member candidates " have told me that earlier the soviet union dictated the course , and now the eu tells us what we should think and say , " he said .
at the same time , he expressed his understanding for chirac 's comments .
" chirac expressed a disappointment that many people in brussels and elsewhere share , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .

but the visit gained new meaning after french president jacques chirac admonished incoming members of the union for failing to " keep quiet " in the international squabble with the u.s. government over a possible war against iraq and after his defense minister turned a routine news conference into a lecture hall , where she admonished poland for " pouring oil on fire " by supporting president george w. bush .
since he was in warsaw , cowen decided to discuss the european dispute as well .
after meeting with polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , cowen made his position clear .
" we think that all means must be used to find a peaceful solution to this conflict but also that nations must show unity and support for the united states given the dangerous regime in iraq , " he said .
commissioners bothered by comments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirs patten chirac 's comments have sparked much heated debate within the eu .
other politicians used stronger words to express their dissatisfaction with him .
chris patten , the european commissioner for external relations , said the new nations were not joining the warsaw pact - the defunct soviet alliance to which many of them once belonged .
they are actually joining " a club for equals and everyone has to be listened to , " patten said .
günter verheugen , the commissioner responsible for eu expansion , also criticized chirac .
" there can be no rule of silence , " verheugen said in an interview published on wednesday in the newspaper die welt .
the furore over chirac 's comments marks the latest dispute to arise over the possible u.s.-led invasion of iraq , an event that france and germany are working to prevent .
chirac made his comments late monday after the 15 leaders of the european union were finally able to end a public dispute over the question by issuing a compromise statement in which they said that " force should be used only as a last resort " and that u.n. inspectors needed more time to search for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
chirac delivers his message afterward , chirac criticized some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 for their support of bush .
" it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet , " chirac said .
three of these countries in the group are poland , hungary and the czech republic .
these three were among eight european countries that published an open declaration of support for the united states last month .
chirac also directed his criticism at romania and bulgaria , two countries that are set to gain eu membership in the second wave of expansion .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
on tuesday , chirac 's defense minister , michele aillot-marie , expressed her displeasure with poland during a news conference she held with poland 's defense minister , jerzy szmajdzinski , and a high-ranking german defense official , walter kolbow .
" i think , " aillot-marie said , " that one can expect the countries that want to join the european union to maintain a certain circumspection and neutrality .
outsiders should never pour oil on the fire . "
in response , szmajdzinski suggested that politicians should watch their words .
" when too many words are said , it is difficult later on to take back these words , " he said .
" that should be kept in mind in all political statements . "
in paris , the spokesman for chirac was unavailable for comment wednesday on the president 's statements because he was attending a summit on africa .
in an editorial , the french daily le monde said that the divisions within the union were well-entrenched before chirac made his statements and the public should not be shocked by them . it also reminded france that everyone was well aware of the eastern european countries ' pro-american tendencies well before the enlargement process was finalized .
but le monde added that france should recognize the need to listen to others , particularly the european union 's new states , if it intends to shed the recent tag of " old europe " awarded by the united states .
chirac seen as breaking tradition gerd langguth , a professor at the university in bonn , suggested in an interview with dw-world that the poles had good reason to be upset .
chirac " really broke with the tradition " of the eu in his statements , langguth said .
under this tradition , the european union strives to maintain a balance , considering the interests of the big , like germany , and the small , like luxembourg .
" i think french diplomats will soon be making an effort to make amends , " langguth said .
chirac directed his criticism at a group that will eventually become france 's potential political rivals as the european union expands from 15 members to more than 25 members .
" with expansion , france 's role will be reduced , " langguth said .
" france will be pushed to the edge . "
joanna apap of the center for european policy studies in brussels put the dispute in a historical perspective .
by supporting the united states , apap said , the eastern europeans are also responding to their ingrained " view of liberty , " a view that was shaped during the cold war when these countries were part of the warsaw pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 humanitarian organizations prepare for war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german aid agencies are readying themselves for the human costs of a war in iraq .
germany may have ruled out the participation of its troops in the eventuality of a war in iraq , but numerous german citizens will be involved in the humanitarian effort . as german chancellor gerhard schröder continues to stand by his anti-war stance and eu leaders resolve to use force only as a “ last resort ” in the current iraq crisis , humanitarian organizations in germany are preparing for what they see as the worst case scenario . germany ready to provide humanitarian aid with fears that a conflict in the gulf will cause considerable deaths and severe damage to iraq ’ s infrastructure as well as unleash a flood of refugees to neighbouring countries , the international red cross , including the german branch , has already begun stockpiling blankets , tents and non-perishable foodstuffs . in germany , volunteer aid workers are standing by .
in munich , the 12-strong team at “ muslime helfen ” - an aid organization specifically set up to help muslims in plight across the world - has already sent a project worker to iraq as part of their planning for providing humanitarian aid in the event of war .
the agency - set up in 1985 and which often works in cooperation with international muslim aid - was part of a wave of german aid organizations and peace initiatives who travelled to iraq in the past weeks . but gaining access to iraq can not be taken for granted .
“ of course it ’ s difficult in general to get into iraq , but we managed it this time , ” muslime helfen aid worker , claudia kreitl told dw-world . the german arm of the red cross - “ rotes kreuz ” - is also preparing to send volunteers to iraq , where the organization has been active for over 20 years .
“ of the 40,000 currently employed by the german red cross , 1,000 are trained for overseas aid work , ” rotes kreuz spokesman , lubbo roawer , told dw-world .
in afghanistan , around 30 germans took part in the humanitarian aid effort after the ruling taliban were ousted by allied forces in 2001 and roawer says it is likely that germans will take part in any humanitarian efforts in iraq . but german aid workers to iraq won ’ t go as german citizens , although the anti-war stance taken by the german government means that simply being german may make the aid worker ’ s job easier .
“ they wear a badge indicating they are part of the international red cross , otherwise it would raise problems with the neutrality of the international red cross , ” he said .
“ -lrb- but -rrb- germans are welcomed as aid workers there .
i would imagine that if the head of the red cross delegation in iraq was named , say ‘ john smith ’ - from a country which is one of the protagonists of the war - then he ’ d probably be perceived as some kind of spy or something , ” he said . civilians suffering under sanctions civilians in iraq are suffering greatly according to aid agencies .
since u.n. sanctions were enforced against iraq in 1990 when iraqi troops invaded kuwait , goods which are deemed to have potential military uses are banned from entering the country . “ even chlorine tablets are on the banned list , ” claudia kreitl said .
“ it ’ s the first thing we take when we deliver aid to iraq . ”
chlorine is vital for making water drinkable in a country where sanitation is at best primitive .
in iraq , infant deaths and diarrhoea are rife . war is not the answer but although aid agencies agree that living under the hussein regime has made life intolerable for many iraqis , some do not believe that the u.s. strategy to remove the regime and install a new government is the long term answer in iraq . “ you really have to ask yourself what the real motivation for this war is - whether it ’ s really about freeing the iraqi people from the hussein regime ” kreitl said . “ there are plenty of other countries in which the situation is just as bad and you don ’ t find western countries saying they want to go and liberate them as well , ” kreitl said .
“ in afghanistan , for example , you have to ask yourself , will the government that has been put in place hold fast in the long term ?
often there is very little understanding of the completely different culture in these countries . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links international red cross - site in english 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.02.2003 eu leaders resolve dispute over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong criticism of eu candidates : french president jacques chirac at an emergency summit , the 15 european union leaders laid aside their differences over iraq .
but france 's president had harsh words for some membership candidates who have supported the united states over the issue . in the end , german foreign minister joschka fischer was right .
the leaders of the european union were able late monday to merge what fischer called their starkly contrasting positions into a common commitment on the disarmament of iraq and a possible u.s.-led invasion of saddam hussein 's country .
in a statement that chancellor gerhard schröder called a classic compromise , the 15 leaders offered words of support for the leading opponents in the debate .
in a signal to schröder and french president jacques chirac , the statement stressed the need to pursue a peaceful course aimed at disarming iraq .
in a signal to british prime minister tony blair , it acknowledged that force might be necessary to enforce a u.n. resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
" war is not inevitable , " the statement said .
" force should be used only as a last resort . "
both positions gain support the declaration continued in a similar tone , endorsing both positions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " we reiterate our full support for the ongoing work of the u.n. inspectors , " it said , reflecting a stance taken by schröder .
" they must be given the time and resources that the united nations security council believes they need . "
later , it used tougher language indicating that the european union was prepared to back blair on the use of force .
" baghdad should have no illusions : it must disarm and cooperate immediately and fully .
iraq has a final opportunity to resolve the crisis peacefully .
the iraqi regime alone will be responsible for the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and does not take this last chance , " the declaration said .
chirac expresses displeasure the harmonious conclusion was interrupted by harsh criticism that french president chirac directed at some of the 10 countries that are to join the eu in the first wave of expansion in 2004 .
at issue was their endorsement of president george w. bush 's aggressive approach to the iraqi issue .
in response , chirac said : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . "
chirac had particular criticism for romania and bulgaria , two of the three countries that hope to be considered for eu membership in the second wave of expansion that will follow later .
" if they wanted to lessen their chances of joining europe , then they could not have found a better way , " chirac said .
romanian prime minister adrian nastase said chirac was apparently venting his anger at the united states on the eastern european countries .
" when i have an argument with my wife , i yell at my sons .
that is apparently the problem that mr. chirac has with the americans and romanians and bulgarians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek premier costas simitis the 13 potential new members were not invited to the summit .
but prime minister costas simitis of greece , which holds the rotating eu presidency , met with them on tuesday to discuss the declaration .
" we must reduce the differences between us , and the central and eastern european countries , " simitis said .
during the session , simitis was able to win the 13 countries support for the declaration .
the eu leaders were called together in an emergency summit by greece as the divide over iraq began to grow within the union last month .
schröder , a public opponent of a possible war , fueled the argument when he said germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
blair then countered with a public declaration supporting the united states that was signed by him and seven other european leaders .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the appeal , which appeared in the wall street journal europe and other european newspapers .
the signing countries included poland , hungary and the czech republic , three of the 10 nations that are in the first wave of eu expansion .
nato caught in argument the conflict spread to the north atlantic treaty organization this month as well , when germany , france and belgium set off one of the alliance 's worst crises by vetoing a u.s. effort to begin military preparations to help turkey , the alliance member that borders iraq .
this dispute was settled late sunday in part by an alliance pledge to support the u.n. effort to disarm iraq peacefully .
after the talks were over , schröder and blair indicated they had not changed their minds about the right approach to disarming iraq .
schröder said he had worked to weaken parts of the declaration that said such things as time is quickly running out .
" that would have been totally unacceptable to us , " schröder said .
blair said afterward that if iraq could not be disarmed peacefully " it has to be done by force . "
schröder also said he had not backed away from his push for a peaceful resolution by endorsing a statement that accepted the use of force as a last resort .
" we have used force as part of our involvement in enduring freedom -lrb- the u.s.-led fight against terrorism -rrb- and in the balkans , " schröder said .
" that is difficult for everyone .
as a matter of principle , we have not been able to rule it out and have never ruled it out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.02.2003 instant aging with a wearable time machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feel like 70 already ?
a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .

a firm in germany has developed a suit that enables the young and fit to see what it 's like to be old and frail .
those trying on the " age explorer " get a foretaste of life at 70 . in the youth-oriented culture of today , there is often a marked lack of sympathy for members of society over 65 .
as the world continues to be predominantly driven by all things " young " , the limitations brought about by old age - arthritis , stiffness , loss of hearing , and a general slowing down - are often met with little understanding , or even outright contempt .
not so for the guinea pigs who submit themselves for a turn in the age explorer , a kind of instant-aging suit developed by the meyer-hentschel consulting firm in the german city of saarbrücken .
ten minutes spent in the age explorer is enough to imbue instant sympathy with the elderly even in the most adamant ageist .
" younger people who try on the suit say , finally , i understand why older people act the way they do , " said hanne meyer-hentschel , the suit 's creator .
instant arthritis the age explorer brings about this generational appreciation by propelling its wearers decades into the future by simulating how the body might behave at the age of 70 .
the suit 's red overalls have 13 pounds of weights sewn into them and pads strapped to the elbows and knees stiffen those joints .
walking across a large room wearing the suit becomes a slow , exhausting experience .
the thick , red age explorer gloves have a velcro-like substance sewn into them : putting them on brings about instant arthritis , since any pressure applied to the hand feels like a thousand tiny needles digging into one 's flesh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as if that were n't enough , headphones , similar to the ear protection airport baggage handlers wear , take away a good deal of one 's hearing .
a welder 's mask-like face shield robs the subject of his peripheral vision , its yellow glass leaves the world looking strange and blurred .
" it 's all about the physical changes that we 're all going to face sooner or later to some degree , " said beate baltes of meyer-hentschel , who babysits those getting their first taste of old age .
not everyone who reaches 70 is going to have arthritis or failing eyesight , but the age explorer is meant to simulate a possible future in which things one takes for granted today will not be quite as self-evident .
not so easy anymore simple things like picking up a napkin out of a stack takes age explorer wearers intense concentration , and about two minutes .
pulling a wallet out of a back pocket with newly arthritic hands becomes a painful and frustrating experience .
once that 's accomplished , dispair can be the next emotion to set in when trying to recognize or pick up the different coins there .
after an tedious , tiring walk across a large room , most of the newly aged are ready for a break on a comfortable sofa .
but while taking a seat is welcome , the difficulty in getting back up on one 's feet again almost makes the sitting not worth the trouble .

the white cross of st andrew 's should ideally have an azure background - pantone 300 in the international colour code - to be precise .
the recommendation follows a long-running debate on an issue which has had people in a flap for several years .
msps on holyrood 's education , culture and sport committee stressed they were merely offering advice .
committee convener karen gillon said : " we should not try to restrict the flags that are flown at football or rugby matches , but there is a suggested colour , pantone 300 , and we should accept that is the correct colour .
all i ever asked for was a strong recommendation from parliament that they should recommend pantone 300 and this is what they have done george reid flag campaigner " it is a voluntary code , not a statutory code and people will not have to throw into the bin a flag they 've already got , " the labour msp for clydesdale added .
retired accountant george reid , from edinburgh , submitted a petition to the public petitions committee in 2000 on the issue .
the education committee considered the petition but decided it was not a devolved matter and msps were powerless to act .
however , scotland 's heraldic authority , the lord lyon king of arms , suggested it was within holyrood 's powers and mr reid petitioned holyrood a second time .
mr reid , 77 , was in the parliament to hear the matter agreed on tuesday .
he said : " i am delighted at the decision .
all i have ever asked for was a strong recommendation from parliament that they should recommend pantone 300 and this is what they have done .
" i hope it 's going to be endorsed . "
mr reid said his petition also urged the flying of the flag and he hoped the publication of a flag-flying code by the st andrew 's society and the saltire society would be further encouragement .
gil paterson , nationalist msp for central scotland region , said the recommendation would now go to the scottish executive .
he said : " it 's a good decision .
it has taken a bit longer than i would have thought , but sometimes good decisions take a bit longer . "

a new series on radio scotland will examine how changing weather patterns will affect our everyday lives .
there is a huge amount of information available on climate change , but a new series called fresh air will attempt to make it more user friendly .
friends of the earth scotland and wwf scotland welcomed the project as a step in the right direction .
climate change will mean more unpredictable weather , more storms and rising seas dr dan barlow foe scotland bbc radio scotland commissioned a report called after the flood which examines the impact and nature of climate change .
the report found climate change is already happening and is human induced .
cutting harmful emissions is the only way to slow it down , it concluded .
fresh air will look at the impact more flooding and less snow will have on the environment .
' stimulate debate ' everything from people 's health to housing will be affected .
scottish tourism could suffer from an expansion of the midge population and the ski-ing industry is likely to be damaged .
there could even be implications for sports like golf and football .
dr dan barlow , foe scotland 's head of research , said it was important to take assertive action .
he said : " climate change will mean more unpredictable weather , more storms and rising seas , leading to floods , drought and failed harvests .
flash floods are becoming more common " it is essential that we urgently take action to reduce emissions of climate change gases from all areas of scottish life . "
he added : " we are delighted that the bbc recognises the significance of climate change and are keen to promote understanding and stimulate debate on this subject . "
wwf scotland 's head of policy , dr richard dixon said despite climate change being the biggest global threat , the scottish executive had not taken it seriously .
he said : " despite progress on renewable energy and energy use in the home , policies on transport , agriculture and economic development are all taking us in the wrong direction .
" even the executive 's promise to aim for 40 % of electricity from renewables by 2020 is looking uncertain after the westminster government 's retreat from a similar uk target . "
fresh air runs for six weeks on bbc radio scotland beginning on wednesday 19 february at 1130 gmt .

they want consumers not to buy prawns until supermarkets can prove they have been caught without harming the environment and local communities .
we badly want eu trawlers to be obliged to operate to eu standards wherever they 're fishing annabelle aish , ejf they also argue for an independent , internationally accepted system of certification and monitoring of prawn production .
the arguments against the present practice of prawn trawling come from the environmental justice foundation -lrb- ejf -rrb- , a uk-based organisation which tries to link environmental problems , human rights and social need .
massive waste it has published a report , squandering the seas , which says trawling for prawns -lrb- known interchangeably as shrimps -rrb- , " is threatening ecological integrity and food security around the world " .
the report 's main findings include : trawlers catch up to 20 kilograms of other species for every one kg of prawns they take they are responsible for one-third of the world 's discarded catch , although they produce less than 2 % of global seafood local fish catches can decline sharply in areas where trawlers operate the trawls cause significant damage to seabed life .
steve trent , ejf 's director , said : " this waste , to feed a luxury market here in the uk and other developed nations , is totally unacceptable when so many in poorer countries are going hungry .
destructive alternative " just how much is the rest of the world paying for our prawn sandwiches ? "
seahorses are under great pressure -lrb- image : project seahorse -rrb- the report says the ratio of bycatch -lrb- other species caught accidentally -rrb- to prawns is typically 5:1 in temperate seas , and 10:1 in the tropics .
but it says in some fisheries the ratio can be 20:1 .
most of the bycatch is simply thrown back into the sea dead or dying , it says .
this harms the stocks on which local fishing communities depend , and deprives poor people of a key source of protein .
it says prawn farming is no substitute , with the farmed fish needing to be fed more than twice their own weight in wild-caught fish before they are big enough to sell .
the report says : " vast areas of mangrove forest have been destroyed to make way for shrimp pond construction , seriously affecting the coastal ecology of many tropical nations . "
voracious appetite often , it says , the trawlers are heavily-subsidised foreign vessels : the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- underwrites up to 46 % of the costs of trawlers fishing for prawns off guinea-bissau in west africa .
the eu is the world 's largest prawn importer : it bought 378,375 tonnes from abroad in 2000 .
turtles : victims of the prawn fishery -lrb- image : wpsi / operation kachapa / wildaid -rrb- within the eu , the uk is the third largest importer .
in 2000 it caught 2,100 tonnes of prawns in its own waters , but imported 77,900 tonnes -lrb- both fished and farmed -rrb- from elsewhere .
annabelle aish of ejf , the report 's main author , told bbc news online : " prawn trawling often denies local fishermen the right to earn a living and to feed their families .
" the boats discard species that have sustained communities for centuries .
levelling up " we badly want eu trawlers to be obliged to operate to eu standards wherever they 're fishing .
" that would mean they 'd have to use bycatch reduction devices , which really do work . "
ejf also wants consumers to avoid buying prawns until supermarkets can prove they have been sustainably caught .
brendan may , chief executive of the marine stewardship council , told bbc news online : " there are some good prawn fisheries , but we welcome this report .
" anything which draws people 's attention to the environmental cost of the fish they eat is very helpful . "
