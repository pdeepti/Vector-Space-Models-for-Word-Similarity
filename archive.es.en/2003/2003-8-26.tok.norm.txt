volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .
analysts expect the company to introduce more variations on the basic design , such as a sport-utility vehicle and a roadster .
new versions of the skoda octavia and seat leon , based on the golf , are also expected to follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw places big bet on china german automaker volkswagen plans a massive investment push in china that will nearly double its production there .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "

others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "
competition for mcdonalds ?
others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .
analysts expect the company to introduce more variations on the basic design , such as a sport-utility vehicle and a roadster .

turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .

" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .
analysts expect the company to introduce more variations on the basic design , such as a sport-utility vehicle and a roadster .
new versions of the skoda octavia and seat leon , based on the golf , are also expected to follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw places big bet on china german automaker volkswagen plans a massive investment push in china that will nearly double its production there .

hück told reuters he had been assured by his regional union chief , baden-württemberg district manager berthold huber , that structural changes would be introduced in the union .
the surprise announcement averts a looming power struggle at germany ’ s largest industrial trade union , plagued in recent months by a series of unsuccessful strikes over working hours and bitter infighting for the reins that led to the resignation of union chief klaus zwickel .
hück had announced his candidacy as a form of protest against alleged maneuvers by incumbent ig metall boss jürgen peters to install as many of his supporters as possible in places of power on the union ’ s executive board .
ig metall plans to elect its new supervisory board over the coming weekend . more briefs 26.08.2003 -pipe- berlin 's catholic diocese bankrupt 26.08.2003 -pipe- telekom and virgin said near settlement on joint venture 26.08.2003 -pipe- fourth ifo index rise indicates recovery 25.08.2003 -pipe- munich re 's ergo to shed foreign businesses 25.08.2003 -pipe- german retailers want relaxed opening hours 25.08.2003 -pipe- vw unveils new generation of golf 25.08.2003 -pipe- cigarette makers set to hike prices 22.08.2003 -pipe- pension contributions set to rise radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .

others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .
analysts expect the company to introduce more variations on the basic design , such as a sport-utility vehicle and a roadster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2003 turks troubled by possibility of tripe ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish fast food faces eu scrutiny as the country scrambles to get into the bloc .
as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .

however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .

the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .

analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2003 turks troubled by possibility of tripe ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish fast food faces eu scrutiny as the country scrambles to get into the bloc .
as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "
competition for mcdonalds ?
others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .
but as ankara continues on its path toward europe , the debate over kokorec is likely to simmer in the pans of fast food bars and homes across the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kebab company plans döner domination the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience - courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "
competition for mcdonalds ?
others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .
but as ankara continues on its path toward europe , the debate over kokorec is likely to simmer in the pans of fast food bars and homes across the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kebab company plans döner domination the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience - courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier .

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .
analysts expect the company to introduce more variations on the basic design , such as a sport-utility vehicle and a roadster .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "
competition for mcdonalds ?
others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.08.2003 volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carrying the hopes of an entire company on its hatchback : the new golf .
volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .
analysts expect the company to introduce more variations on the basic design , such as a sport-utility vehicle and a roadster .
new versions of the skoda octavia and seat leon , based on the golf , are also expected to follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw places big bet on china german automaker volkswagen plans a massive investment push in china that will nearly double its production there .

but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "
competition for mcdonalds ?
others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .
analysts expect the company to introduce more variations on the basic design , such as a sport-utility vehicle and a roadster .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .
if things weren ’ t bad enough , the falling market share of the formerly dependable golf and its sedan -lrb- saloon -rrb- sister the passat combined with the negative impact of the strong euro and the depressed state of the global auto market towards the middle of this year to drive second-quarter profits down by a whopping 50 percent . model variations to follow in a bid to cover all eventualities in such a fickle market , the launch of the new golf is expected to be followed by a number of new designs from vw which could pick up the slack if the company ’ s estimates are overly optimistic .
analysts expect the company to introduce more variations on the basic design , such as a sport-utility vehicle and a roadster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.08.2003 turks troubled by possibility of tripe ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish fast food faces eu scrutiny as the country scrambles to get into the bloc .
as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "
competition for mcdonalds ?
others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .
but as ankara continues on its path toward europe , the debate over kokorec is likely to simmer in the pans of fast food bars and homes across the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kebab company plans döner domination the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience - courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier .

volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain . volkswagen ag , europe 's largest carmaker , revealed its ambitious sales targets for the latest incarnation of its popular golf hatchback range on monday , outlining the company ’ s plan to sell 135,000 fifth-generation golfs in 2003 following the car ’ s launch in october . vw also forecasts selling more than 600,000 units in 2004 in an attempt to revive the fortunes of the ageing product range and reclaim the model ’ s position as the best-selling car in europe . volkswagen ’ s chief executive bernd pischetsrieder , the man who has pledged rigid cost cuts to battle falling sales since taking the helm last year , said the newest golf was “ technically and visually the biggest step forward ” since its first launch in 1974 . more than just popularity at stake it ’ s clear that the car manufacturer is hoping that the new model will do more than just replace its usurpers as europe ’ s hottest hatchback and must also hope that its confidence is not misplaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder .
“ the golf has set standards .
every golf generation is and has been a trendsetter .
it carries the attributes of dynamic travel , security and a timeless aesthetic , ” said pischetsrieder -lrb- picture -rrb- among the smoke and glittering lights of the unveiling ceremony . the long-awaited new golf will go on sale in october after being shown at the frankfurt car show next month .
the latest model , criticized by some for being ‘ bland ’ , is expected to have a peak volume of 2.4 million units compared with 1.8 million units of its predecessor .
considering the effect the car has had on the financial health of vw over its lifetime , much is riding on the new car ’ s ability to attract customers . integral to vw success the golf generates about 15 percent of group sales and profits , and analysts view sales of the new model as a crucial test as to whether vw can regain the lead in a sector it once ruled .
in its heyday , the golf sold about one million units a year , with total sales since its birth topping an estimated 22 million cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with lower production cost , vw expects higher profits on the golf . " naturally the golf is generating a lot of hope for vw , " said jürgen pieper , analyst at bankhaus metzler , in an interview with the financial times deutschland . with ever more efficient production techniques in place , vw expects to reduce production costs of the new golf by at least 10 percent .
analysts say that this should boost its profit margin to at least 5 percent compared to the group average of 4 percent . however , competition in the sector once dominated by the golf is fierce .
vw can no longer rely solely on the car ’ s reputation as europe ’ s best selling-car to unload units .
that mantle was passed to the rival peugeot ’ s 206 model in 2001 .
since then , the popularity of the golf has waned and the subsequent effect on its maker has been predictably detrimental . sales down in first half of 2003 in the first six months of 2003 , sales of the golf have fallen 18 percent in western europe , the car ’ s largest market , according to figures provided by automotive news europe .
the effect of that decrease contributed to sales in western european decreasing by 4.8 per cent with sales of all volkswagen brands dropping 7.5 per cent overall .

as their country works its way towards european union accession negotiations , more and more turks fear a popular tripe dish banned in western europe could meet the same fate at home . be it in the marketplace of bustling ankara or along the bosporus in istanbul , turks love to snack on greasy kokorec , a sandwich stuffed with lamb tripe that has placed the european union candidate country under the crosshairs of brussels regulators .
as part of its efforts to qualify for eu membership , turkey has passed legislation making its government more transparent and democratic .
the government has also abolished the death penalty .
but few in turkey expected to have to change their diet in order to stay on track for economic and political integration with europe .
but under policies put in place in the european union that ban the sale of animal intestines , livers , eyes , brains , spleens and other delicate parts that are difficult to cook safely and can contain concentrations of disease in an effort to combat mad cow disease and other livestock maladies , turkish officials may be forced to ban the ubiquitous dish .
turks have plenty to fear – brussels already banned the same specialty in greece , where it is known as kokoretsi .
but the long arm of european law has had little impact on the greek tradition of eating kokoretsi during orthodox easter .
tradition vs. eu prosperity rumors about an imminent ban have triggered an outcry across turkey , where consumers fear that the path to eu membership may compromise national traditions .
turkish leaders have said they want to apply all eu political standards to national law by 2004 in order to expedite membership .
at least one turkish province has already implemented a ban in an effort to bring itself in line with eu regulations .
in izmir , in western turkey , officials banned street vendors from selling kokorec , döner kebaps and turkish meatballs .
under the law , the province fines snack bars about € 50 if they are caught selling the specialties .
frequent offenders can be shut down by the local health authority .
turkish public health researchers are also sounding the alarm .
they warn that kokorec sold at street snack bars contains high levels of unhealthy bacteria .
researchers at the turkey ’ s uludag university found in a recent study that many restaurants failed to adhere to hygienic standards when preparing the dish .
" the research unveiled the intestines used in kokorec production are not well cleaned and they included bacteria , " researcher seran temelli told the turkish daily news .
turks : " get used to it " but public resistance is mounting in a country where love for the sautéed and spicy innards is akin to the american obsession with the hamburger .
one pop singer even wrote a song about the spiced innards specialty , with lyrics calling the eu " strangers " who have come between turks and their kokorec .
" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "

others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .

" europe had better get used to kokorec , " said mehmet aztekin , head of the ankara association of restaurateurs , according to the internet news site eu business .
" because there won ’ t be any going back . "
he said any kind of ban on kokorec , which some have rumored could come as quickly as jan .
2004 , would be " absolutely impossible . "
" everyday i eat two or three portions , " hüseyan dogan , a cook at an istanbul restaurant that serves kokorec , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" and i ’ ve never been sick . "
competition for mcdonalds ?
others are so distraught by the idea of a life without kokorec , they ’ ve stooped to peddling conspiracy theories .
suat kaya , who runs a snack bar serving kokorec near the main train station in instanbul , believes washington is pressuring ankara to put the brakes on the selling of kokorec . " they ’ re afraid our kokorec will become competition for mcdonalds , " kaya warned the süddeutsche zeitung .
for now , turks can continue to enjoy their kokorec .
earlier this month , the turkish interior ministry denied a rumored plan to pull licenses from cooks who continue to sell it .
but as ankara continues on its path toward europe , the debate over kokorec is likely to simmer in the pans of fast food bars and homes across the country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german kebab company plans döner domination the döner kebab has filled many a hungry belly and is now set to reach a new audience - courtesy of germany ’ s largest supplier .

an alliance of campaign groups have made a joint plea for local authorities to put on record their opposition to gm .
they also want them to ban any gm ingredients from their catering , including school meals .
the demand comes shortly before the uk government is due to report on the results of its public debate on the issue .

" it 's clear to us that our farmers will enjoy a marketing advantage by promoting our food as being gm-free - a status that will strike a chord with concerned consumers throughout the world . "
the anti-gm route ask the eu to exempt their areas from gm consent keep services like school meals free of gm ingredients ensure land is not used for gm crops the groups have written to all welsh councils and national park authorities outlining what action they could take .
the campaigners want other councils to follow the lead of areas such as pembrokeshire , flintshire and denbighshire , which have already passed resolutions opposing gm crops .
a number of english councils have done the same .

" until proper research , including full clinical trials , has been carried out , we can not afford to gamble with the health of the nation . "
rhian connick , head of the national federation of women 's institutes in wales said its members were worried that too little was known about the impact of gm .
" wi members have still to be assured that gm crops and food are safe and until proper research has been completed then wales should remain gm free , " she said .

property website hometrack said the average price of a house in england and wales held steady at £ 135,200 during the month , with buyers remaining in a cautious mood .
but the company said there were tentative signs of a rebound in the property market , with the number of new buyers climbing by 1.5 % from july , and completed transactions rising 5 % .
in another sign of underlying strength , the percentage of the original asking price achieved by sellers stabilised at 94.5 % .
and while house price growth was flat in the uk as a whole , prices rose in the north and west , with cumbria , merseyside and mid-wales leading the way .
" while house prices remain flat this month as a whole , this hides a turning tide within the regions , " said hometrack housing economist john wriglesworth .
crash fears ' unfounded ' " house price falls in the southern counties are diminishing both by number and extent .
meanwhile , the northern counties are showing clearer signs of house price revival . "
the hometrack survey tallies with the latest research from the royal institute of chartered surveyors , which last week said prices were rising in some regions , while enquiries from new buyers were also up .
the uk 's most closely watched monthly property market surveys , compiled by the halifax and nationwide building societies , have painted a picture of sharply declining house price inflation this year amid a dearth of first-time buyers .
while the trend has remained upwards for the uk as a whole thanks to continued strong growth in the north , former property market hotspots in london and the south east have stagnated or fallen slightly .
the slowdown in house price growth , which comes after five years of double digit gains , has stirred fears of a property market crash of the kind which rocked homeowners - and the wider economy - in the early 1990s .
but hometrack 's john wriglesworth played down fears of a collapse in house prices .
" worries of a housing market crash are now proving to have no intelligent foundation , " he said .
further evidence that the property market remains in fundamentally good health came on tuesday from housebuilder persimmon , which said pre-tax profits for the first six months of 2003 climbed nearly 30 % on the year to £ 157m .
the firm said it had insulated itelf from the localised slowdown in london by focusing on high-growth regions in then north .

a recent survey showed 15 schools in kent had radio masts on their premises .
kent county council brought banned new masts on its land two years ago - but opposition labour members have now called for the existing ones to be removed too .
councillor mike eddy , leader of the labour group on kent county council , said it was important to protect pupils ' safety .
very cautious he said the council must do more to encourage the governing bodies of schools not to renew existing contracts with telecommunications companies .
but conservative councillor paul carter , cabinet member for education standards and pupil services , said the council had already taken a " very cautious " approach when it banned new masts in 2001 .
he said : " as soon as that directive went out , no new radio masts have been erected on school properties .
" we have 15 schools that have existing radio masts and when those contracts expire , they will not be renewed . "

his picture is widely available and his biography , those bits we are allowed to know about , is well documented .
he was first exposed to the glare of publicity during last summer 's hutton inquiry into the death of weapons scientist dr david kelly .
pictures of him arriving at the royal courts of justice to give evidence on his role in overseeing the government 's dossier on iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction were flashed around the world .
yet as head of mi6 mr scarlett will , in accordance with long-held convention , not be making public appearances , or giving interviews .
nevertheless publicity is precisely what his appointment will get as it immediately prompted something of a political row with the lib dems saying it was " highly controversial " and the tories branding it " inappropriate " .
mate ?
that is in part because of mr scarlett 's defence of the government 's iraq weapons dossier during lord hutton 's inquiry .
it does not help either that tony blair 's former spindoctor , alastair campbell , apparently refers to mr scarlett as " mate " .
in fact , many believed his chances of becoming the head of mi6 had effectively come to an end when his evidence at hutton played such a key part in the government 's defence of how it portrayed intelligence information when it made the case for war with iraq .
then , mr scarlett was chairman of the joint intelligence committee , a body which includes all the chiefs of all the intelligence agencies , and was responsible for the september dossier .
its main job , under normal circumstances , is to provide the prime minister with a weekly briefing on the security threats facing the uk and to advise the cabinet secretary on the funding needs of the intelligence agencies .
during the course of the hutton inquiry , mr scarlett was criticised for agreeing to make key last minute changes in the dossier because number 10 chief of staff jonathan powell feared it would play into the hands of anti-war groups .
concerns were also raised that the jic ignored warnings that the iraq weapons claims were " over-egged " .
russian speaker prior to his exposure to the unfamiliar glare of the media , mr scarlett spent 30 years working for the secret intelligence service , otherwise known as mi6 , and ended up as one of its five directors .
a fluent russian speaker , he joined mi6 in 1970 and during his early career served in nairobi , moscow , and paris .
he went on to be in charge of britain 's station in moscow .
on retiring in september 2001 , he was appointed chairman of the cabinet office joint intelligence committee -lrb- jic -rrb- , being in the job just a week when al-qaeda mounted its 11 september attacks on new york and washington .
mr scarlett let it be known that he approved of the september dossier 's contents , denying claims that downing street had interfered with it and exaggerated the threat posed by iraq .
he sent a note to sir david omand , the cabinet office security and intelligence co-ordinator , in which he said that dr kelly needed " a proper security-style interview " to clarify apparent inconsistencies in his statement about his meeting with gilligan .
he is married with three daughters and a son .
he was educated at epsom college and magdalen college , oxford , where he obtained a first-class degree in history .
he lists his interests in who 's who as history , medieval churches and family .

his picture is widely available and his biography , those bits we are allowed to know about , is well documented .
he was first exposed to the glare of publicity during last summer 's hutton inquiry into the death of weapons scientist dr david kelly .
pictures of him arriving at the royal courts of justice to give evidence on his role in overseeing the government 's dossier on iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction were flashed around the world .
yet as head of mi6 mr scarlett will , in accordance with long-held convention , not be making public appearances , or giving interviews .
nevertheless publicity is precisely what his appointment will get as it immediately prompted something of a political row with the lib dems saying it was " highly controversial " and the tories branding it " inappropriate " .
mate ?
that is in part because of mr scarlett 's defence of the government 's iraq weapons dossier during lord hutton 's inquiry .
it does not help either that tony blair 's former spindoctor , alastair campbell , apparently refers to mr scarlett as " mate " .
in fact , many believed his chances of becoming the head of mi6 had effectively come to an end when his evidence at hutton played such a key part in the government 's defence of how it portrayed intelligence information when it made the case for war with iraq .
then , mr scarlett was chairman of the joint intelligence committee , a body which includes all the chiefs of all the intelligence agencies , and was responsible for the september dossier .
its main job , under normal circumstances , is to provide the prime minister with a weekly briefing on the security threats facing the uk and to advise the cabinet secretary on the funding needs of the intelligence agencies .
during the course of the hutton inquiry , mr scarlett was criticised for agreeing to make key last minute changes in the dossier because number 10 chief of staff jonathan powell feared it would play into the hands of anti-war groups .
concerns were also raised that the jic ignored warnings that the iraq weapons claims were " over-egged " .
russian speaker prior to his exposure to the unfamiliar glare of the media , mr scarlett spent 30 years working for the secret intelligence service , otherwise known as mi6 , and ended up as one of its five directors .
a fluent russian speaker , he joined mi6 in 1970 and during his early career served in nairobi , moscow , and paris .
he went on to be in charge of britain 's station in moscow .
on retiring in september 2001 , he was appointed chairman of the cabinet office joint intelligence committee -lrb- jic -rrb- , being in the job just a week when al-qaeda mounted its 11 september attacks on new york and washington .
mr scarlett let it be known that he approved of the september dossier 's contents , denying claims that downing street had interfered with it and exaggerated the threat posed by iraq .
he sent a note to sir david omand , the cabinet office security and intelligence co-ordinator , in which he said that dr kelly needed " a proper security-style interview " to clarify apparent inconsistencies in his statement about his meeting with gilligan .
he is married with three daughters and a son .
he was educated at epsom college and magdalen college , oxford , where he obtained a first-class degree in history .
he lists his interests in who 's who as history , medieval churches and family .

the united states is holding talks with hungary about using taszar air base to train iraqis in police skills in the coming months , but no final agreement had been reached .
news of the move comes with the bush administration under increasing domestic pressure to ease the burden on existing forces in iraq .
on monday , the death toll for us troops in " post-war " iraq rose to 138 - the same number of troops killed in the conflict up to 1 may , when president bush declared an end to combat operations .
the us army used the taszar base earlier this year to train more than 100 exiled iraqis as guides , translators and for other non-combat tasks with the coalition forces which invaded iraq in march .
us officials have set the goal of training and deploying 65,000 iraqi police officers around the country , a spokeswoman for the coalition provisional authority in baghdad told reuters news agency .
about 37,000 iraqi police officers are already working in iraq , the spokeswoman said , meaning thousands more could require training at taszar , if hungary agrees to the arrangement ' iraqi face ' on security hungary 's government is receptive to the idea but is still waiting for a formal request from washington , the hungarian foreign ministry told associated press .
" of course , any official request would have to be considered further by the government , but something of this nature could help save the taszar base from closure , " spokesman tamas toth said .
us defence secretary donald rumsfeld has said iraqis are being trained at an accelerated pace to put " an iraqi face " on the security forces .
" it may well be that a number of them will be trained outside the country , " mr rumsfeld said on monday .
earlier this month , the former new york police chief who has been put in charge of rebuilding iraq 's police force said he was making good progress in controlling crime .
bernard kerik - who was appointed to run the interior ministry - said police had recently broken up four gangs involved in kidnapping iraqi civilians for ransom .
