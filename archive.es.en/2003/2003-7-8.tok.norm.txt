at an event called “ scoolday , ” the german military kicked off its first ever country-wide recruitment campaign for its officer-training program .
the bundeswehr ’ s new secret weapon : pop-starlet sex appeal . in the military , there is a long tradition of sending pop stars to entertain troops who are serving their countries in wartime .
but the german army has put a twist on the practice , bringing in one of the country ’ s hottest pop properties – singer-actress jeanette biedermann – in a move to recruit more officer candidates . the bundeswehr , as germany ’ s army is called , is worried about the future of its officers ’ corps .
some 14,000 young men and women apply for 2,200 open positions each year – but those in charge say they are concerned about attracting good-quality applicants . “ we have very good people , but we don ’ t know how the application situation will develop over the next six years , ” conceded press officer lieutenant colonel heinz-wolfgang spranger to german television ard .
and the number of applicants for officer training school – a 12-year-long training path which requires applicants to have a high-school diploma - is “ declining a bit . ” a new military especially in the areas of high-tech and computers , the “ bund ” is looking for qualified people , said major general jan oerding . “ we have to compete with the private sector . ” the face of the german military is changing : from a cold-war era dinosaur whose main goal was defending its eastern borders from attack , to a nato member highly active in various peacekeeping operations .
indeed , germany has some 8,500 troops deployed overseas , coming in only behind the united states in the number of soldiers serving abroad .
and the death of five peacekeeping soldiers in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month is a further reminder that a stint in the german military is not the secure career that it was in the peaceful , post-world war ii decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , military officials have gone on the offensive to avoid what they see could someday become a dire situation .
they have started a first-of-its-kind advertising campaign to get german youth interested in a career as a military officer . part of this campaign is the “ scoolday ” information fair – the -lrb- mis -rrb- spelling is intentional – which kicked off on monday in karlsruhe . about 500 students were allowed to skip classes and ogle tanks , amored vehicles , helicopters and bazookas . siren song top on the list of enticements , however , was a free concert given by pierced pop idol jeanette biedermann , germany ’ s answer to britney spears .
lieutenant colonel spranger praised the blonde berliner : " jeanette offered to come .
she is a really hot property , and a magnet for today ’ s youth . ” on monday , the 22-year-old actress-turned-pop singer certainly was a draw for many of the young men who showed up . tarik azir , a student at the tulla technical school in karlsruhe , had come just to see her . “ she is good looking and can sing well , ” said the 15 year old , who was aiming a bazooka a target .
however , the bundeswehr may have to come up with more than just the pop starlet to solve its problems .
azir said he still does n't intend to pursue a career in the military and " would rather not ” shoot the bazooka . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de overseas missions now bundeswehr 's priority germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .

at an event called “ scoolday , ” the german military kicked off its first ever country-wide recruitment campaign for its officer-training program .
the bundeswehr ’ s new secret weapon : pop-starlet sex appeal . in the military , there is a long tradition of sending pop stars to entertain troops who are serving their countries in wartime .
but the german army has put a twist on the practice , bringing in one of the country ’ s hottest pop properties – singer-actress jeanette biedermann – in a move to recruit more officer candidates . the bundeswehr , as germany ’ s army is called , is worried about the future of its officers ’ corps .
some 14,000 young men and women apply for 2,200 open positions each year – but those in charge say they are concerned about attracting good-quality applicants . “ we have very good people , but we don ’ t know how the application situation will develop over the next six years , ” conceded press officer lieutenant colonel heinz-wolfgang spranger to german television ard .
and the number of applicants for officer training school – a 12-year-long training path which requires applicants to have a high-school diploma - is “ declining a bit . ” a new military especially in the areas of high-tech and computers , the “ bund ” is looking for qualified people , said major general jan oerding . “ we have to compete with the private sector . ” the face of the german military is changing : from a cold-war era dinosaur whose main goal was defending its eastern borders from attack , to a nato member highly active in various peacekeeping operations .
indeed , germany has some 8,500 troops deployed overseas , coming in only behind the united states in the number of soldiers serving abroad .
and the death of five peacekeeping soldiers in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month is a further reminder that a stint in the german military is not the secure career that it was in the peaceful , post-world war ii decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , military officials have gone on the offensive to avoid what they see could someday become a dire situation .
they have started a first-of-its-kind advertising campaign to get german youth interested in a career as a military officer . part of this campaign is the “ scoolday ” information fair – the -lrb- mis -rrb- spelling is intentional – which kicked off on monday in karlsruhe . about 500 students were allowed to skip classes and ogle tanks , amored vehicles , helicopters and bazookas . siren song top on the list of enticements , however , was a free concert given by pierced pop idol jeanette biedermann , germany ’ s answer to britney spears .
lieutenant colonel spranger praised the blonde berliner : " jeanette offered to come .
she is a really hot property , and a magnet for today ’ s youth . ” on monday , the 22-year-old actress-turned-pop singer certainly was a draw for many of the young men who showed up . tarik azir , a student at the tulla technical school in karlsruhe , had come just to see her . “ she is good looking and can sing well , ” said the 15 year old , who was aiming a bazooka a target .
however , the bundeswehr may have to come up with more than just the pop starlet to solve its problems .

at an event called “ scoolday , ” the german military kicked off its first ever country-wide recruitment campaign for its officer-training program .
the bundeswehr ’ s new secret weapon : pop-starlet sex appeal . in the military , there is a long tradition of sending pop stars to entertain troops who are serving their countries in wartime .
but the german army has put a twist on the practice , bringing in one of the country ’ s hottest pop properties – singer-actress jeanette biedermann – in a move to recruit more officer candidates . the bundeswehr , as germany ’ s army is called , is worried about the future of its officers ’ corps .
some 14,000 young men and women apply for 2,200 open positions each year – but those in charge say they are concerned about attracting good-quality applicants . “ we have very good people , but we don ’ t know how the application situation will develop over the next six years , ” conceded press officer lieutenant colonel heinz-wolfgang spranger to german television ard .
and the number of applicants for officer training school – a 12-year-long training path which requires applicants to have a high-school diploma - is “ declining a bit . ” a new military especially in the areas of high-tech and computers , the “ bund ” is looking for qualified people , said major general jan oerding . “ we have to compete with the private sector . ” the face of the german military is changing : from a cold-war era dinosaur whose main goal was defending its eastern borders from attack , to a nato member highly active in various peacekeeping operations .
indeed , germany has some 8,500 troops deployed overseas , coming in only behind the united states in the number of soldiers serving abroad .

they have started a first-of-its-kind advertising campaign to get german youth interested in a career as a military officer . part of this campaign is the “ scoolday ” information fair – the -lrb- mis -rrb- spelling is intentional – which kicked off on monday in karlsruhe . about 500 students were allowed to skip classes and ogle tanks , amored vehicles , helicopters and bazookas . siren song top on the list of enticements , however , was a free concert given by pierced pop idol jeanette biedermann , germany ’ s answer to britney spears .
lieutenant colonel spranger praised the blonde berliner : " jeanette offered to come .
she is a really hot property , and a magnet for today ’ s youth . ” on monday , the 22-year-old actress-turned-pop singer certainly was a draw for many of the young men who showed up . tarik azir , a student at the tulla technical school in karlsruhe , had come just to see her . “ she is good looking and can sing well , ” said the 15 year old , who was aiming a bazooka a target .

at an event called “ scoolday , ” the german military kicked off its first ever country-wide recruitment campaign for its officer-training program .
the bundeswehr ’ s new secret weapon : pop-starlet sex appeal . in the military , there is a long tradition of sending pop stars to entertain troops who are serving their countries in wartime .
but the german army has put a twist on the practice , bringing in one of the country ’ s hottest pop properties – singer-actress jeanette biedermann – in a move to recruit more officer candidates . the bundeswehr , as germany ’ s army is called , is worried about the future of its officers ’ corps .
some 14,000 young men and women apply for 2,200 open positions each year – but those in charge say they are concerned about attracting good-quality applicants . “ we have very good people , but we don ’ t know how the application situation will develop over the next six years , ” conceded press officer lieutenant colonel heinz-wolfgang spranger to german television ard .
and the number of applicants for officer training school – a 12-year-long training path which requires applicants to have a high-school diploma - is “ declining a bit . ” a new military especially in the areas of high-tech and computers , the “ bund ” is looking for qualified people , said major general jan oerding . “ we have to compete with the private sector . ” the face of the german military is changing : from a cold-war era dinosaur whose main goal was defending its eastern borders from attack , to a nato member highly active in various peacekeeping operations .
indeed , germany has some 8,500 troops deployed overseas , coming in only behind the united states in the number of soldiers serving abroad .
and the death of five peacekeeping soldiers in a suicide bombing in afghanistan last month is a further reminder that a stint in the german military is not the secure career that it was in the peaceful , post-world war ii decades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now , military officials have gone on the offensive to avoid what they see could someday become a dire situation .
they have started a first-of-its-kind advertising campaign to get german youth interested in a career as a military officer . part of this campaign is the “ scoolday ” information fair – the -lrb- mis -rrb- spelling is intentional – which kicked off on monday in karlsruhe . about 500 students were allowed to skip classes and ogle tanks , amored vehicles , helicopters and bazookas . siren song top on the list of enticements , however , was a free concert given by pierced pop idol jeanette biedermann , germany ’ s answer to britney spears .
lieutenant colonel spranger praised the blonde berliner : " jeanette offered to come .
she is a really hot property , and a magnet for today ’ s youth . ” on monday , the 22-year-old actress-turned-pop singer certainly was a draw for many of the young men who showed up . tarik azir , a student at the tulla technical school in karlsruhe , had come just to see her . “ she is good looking and can sing well , ” said the 15 year old , who was aiming a bazooka a target .
however , the bundeswehr may have to come up with more than just the pop starlet to solve its problems .
azir said he still does n't intend to pursue a career in the military and " would rather not ” shoot the bazooka . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de overseas missions now bundeswehr 's priority germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern .

consumer affairs minister renate künast has announced an initiative to take on a growing problem in german society – child and teen obesity . “ every third child , and every fifth teenager , is massively overweight , ” künast told a german television program on tuesday . the minister wants to see to it that german children learn to eat better , and get more exercise . according to künast , the increase in obesity is due to two factors : the soaring growth of the fast food industry over the past 20 years , and a lack of exercise resulting from the increase in computers and television sets in the home . society pays the obesity epidemic is more than just a question of looks – it is also very costly for the german health care system , künast said at the opening tuesday of the “ children and nutrition ” congress in berlin .
the meeting , which included representatives of the consumer affairs ministry , the german parents ’ association , the german sports league , scientists and business leaders , is the government ’ s first step at tackling the problem head on . speaking at the berlin conference , pediatrician kurt stübing warned that poor childhood nutrition can set the stage for severe psychological and somatic disorders .

consumer affairs minister renate künast has announced an initiative to take on a growing problem in german society – child and teen obesity . “ every third child , and every fifth teenager , is massively overweight , ” künast told a german television program on tuesday . the minister wants to see to it that german children learn to eat better , and get more exercise . according to künast , the increase in obesity is due to two factors : the soaring growth of the fast food industry over the past 20 years , and a lack of exercise resulting from the increase in computers and television sets in the home . society pays the obesity epidemic is more than just a question of looks – it is also very costly for the german health care system , künast said at the opening tuesday of the “ children and nutrition ” congress in berlin .
the meeting , which included representatives of the consumer affairs ministry , the german parents ’ association , the german sports league , scientists and business leaders , is the government ’ s first step at tackling the problem head on . speaking at the berlin conference , pediatrician kurt stübing warned that poor childhood nutrition can set the stage for severe psychological and somatic disorders .

the bundeswehr ’ s new secret weapon : pop-starlet sex appeal . in the military , there is a long tradition of sending pop stars to entertain troops who are serving their countries in wartime .
but the german army has put a twist on the practice , bringing in one of the country ’ s hottest pop properties – singer-actress jeanette biedermann – in a move to recruit more officer candidates . the bundeswehr , as germany ’ s army is called , is worried about the future of its officers ’ corps .
some 14,000 young men and women apply for 2,200 open positions each year – but those in charge say they are concerned about attracting good-quality applicants . “ we have very good people , but we don ’ t know how the application situation will develop over the next six years , ” conceded press officer lieutenant colonel heinz-wolfgang spranger to german television ard .

not only did under-25s fail to vote in significant numbers , but only 21 % of the next age group , 25-to-34 year olds , exercised their democratic rights .
the electoral commission ordered the research because it wants to find out why so few people voted in the welsh elections .
turnout fell to 38 % in 2003 , down from 46 % in 1999 and 59.4 % at the 2001 general election .
the study found that people aged over 55 were much better at voting , with 56 % choosing to go to the polls .
the scale of young people 's disaffection with the polls is considered startling .
younger people were also more ignorant of what the assembly had done , the powers it had and the voting system for it .
the most common reason given for not voting was being " too busy " .
four-in-10 of those asked said they would be more likely to participate if postal , telephone or internet voting was available .
electoral commissioner glyn mathias said : " clearly the role and importance of the national assembly has to be better communicated to the people who are expected to vote in its elections .
" the research does provide some encouraging news for those piloting the introduction of new voting mechanisms .
" this is another area which the commission will be studying in the coming months . "
the study was carried out by nop during the three days following polling day and involved telephone interviewing of 1,153 adults in wales .

the electoral commission ordered the research because it wants to find out why so few people voted in the welsh elections .
turnout fell to 38 % in 2003 , down from 46 % in 1999 and 59.4 % at the 2001 general election .
the study found that people aged over 55 were much better at voting , with 56 % choosing to go to the polls .
the scale of young people 's disaffection with the polls is considered startling .
the electoral commission wants to understand the reason for the low turnout in may 's poll younger people were also more ignorant of what the assembly had done , the powers it had and the voting system for it .
the most common reason given for not voting was being " too busy " .
four-in-10 of those asked said they would be more likely to participate if postal , telephone or internet voting was available .
electoral commissioner glyn mathias said : " clearly the role and importance of the national assembly has to be better communicated to the people who are expected to vote in its elections .
" the research does provide some encouraging news for those piloting the introduction of new voting mechanisms .
" this is another area which the commission will be studying in the coming months . "
the study was carried out by nop during the three days following polling day and involved telephone interviewing of 1,153 adults in wales .
