it marks the end of a long journey for a manuscript that survived wars and was split by the cold war . whether at the german reunification celebration , the olympic games or a tv gala , when things get festive , beethoven 's ninth symphony is ubiquitous .
now the classical favorite , with text from friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy , " is being lauded by the world 's top cultural leaders : the original score of the ninth symphony will be officially recorded at a unesco " memory of the world " celebration on sunday featuring the philharmonic of the nations conducted by justus frantz .
the nearly 200-page manuscript is one of the most important documents in the music department of berlin 's state library , where other important originals by bach , mozart and mendelssohn bartholdy are kept .
for library director graham jefcoate , the manuscript is a special treasure .
no other symphonic work has had such a broad impact as ludwig van beethoven 's opus 125 in d-minor .
nearly the entire work , as written by beethoven between 1822 and 1824 , is at the library on unter den linden .
just two pages from the second movement are housed at the beethoven house , site of the composer 's birth , in bonn and three folios from the finale at the bibliotheque nationale in paris .
because the manuscript is in raw form , with many corrections written in , it is difficult to read .

as beethoven 's work debuted on may 7 , 1824 , in vienna 's kärntnertortheater , the 53-year-old master stood at the conductor 's side and helped keep the rhythm with a baton .
a listener reported later how beethoven , who was already suffering from increasing hearing loss , only noticed the applause after a little while and then gave an awkward thanks to his audience .
after the composer 's death in 1827 , the text fell into the hands of his biographer , anton schindler .
and in 1846 , parts of it went to the royal library in berlin , which gave the donor a stipend .
after the viennese publishing family ataria donated the final portion to the library in 1901 , the original was mostly complete .
divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but airbus is also marking a victory .
for the first time in its history , the company expects to sell more planes this year than its american rival boeing .
in 2002 , europe 's largest aircraft producer posted sales of € 20.5 billion -lrb- $ 21.7 billion -rrb- , down just € 1 billion from the previous year .
overall , however , airlines reduced their orders for new jets by 25 percent , and the company says a weaker dollar could also dampen foreign sales . more briefs 14.01.2003 -pipe- budget germanwings introduces new routes 13.01.2003 -pipe- german industrial output on the upswing 13.01.2003 -pipe- sales decline at german retail giant 13.01.2003 -pipe- foreign demand revs up german car market 10.01.2003 -pipe- less new companies in 2002 09.01.2003 -pipe- germany 's largest retailer suffers christmas hangover 09.01.2003 -pipe- ecb leaves interest rates unchanged 09.01.2003 -pipe- german cars : big in japan radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.01.2003 the 9 lives of beethoven 's ninth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's original score on sunday , beethoven 's ninth symphony will be named one of unesco 's official cultural heritage treasures .
it marks the end of a long journey for a manuscript that survived wars and was split by the cold war . whether at the german reunification celebration , the olympic games or a tv gala , when things get festive , beethoven 's ninth symphony is ubiquitous .
now the classical favorite , with text from friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy , " is being lauded by the world 's top cultural leaders : the original score of the ninth symphony will be officially recorded at a unesco " memory of the world " celebration on sunday featuring the philharmonic of the nations conducted by justus frantz .
the nearly 200-page manuscript is one of the most important documents in the music department of berlin 's state library , where other important originals by bach , mozart and mendelssohn bartholdy are kept .
for library director graham jefcoate , the manuscript is a special treasure .
no other symphonic work has had such a broad impact as ludwig van beethoven 's opus 125 in d-minor .
nearly the entire work , as written by beethoven between 1822 and 1824 , is at the library on unter den linden .
just two pages from the second movement are housed at the beethoven house , site of the composer 's birth , in bonn and three folios from the finale at the bibliotheque nationale in paris .
because the manuscript is in raw form , with many corrections written in , it is difficult to read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven monument in bonn .
as beethoven 's work debuted on may 7 , 1824 , in vienna 's kärntnertortheater , the 53-year-old master stood at the conductor 's side and helped keep the rhythm with a baton .
a listener reported later how beethoven , who was already suffering from increasing hearing loss , only noticed the applause after a little while and then gave an awkward thanks to his audience .
after the composer 's death in 1827 , the text fell into the hands of his biographer , anton schindler .
and in 1846 , parts of it went to the royal library in berlin , which gave the donor a stipend .
after the viennese publishing family ataria donated the final portion to the library in 1901 , the original was mostly complete .
divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.01.2003 new vw van at center of controversial wage plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw worked around traditional labor practices to produce the " touran " in germany volkswagen 's new minivan is the product of an innovative program to link wages to profits and demand while creating new jobs .
but critics say it is creating an employee underclass . german carmaker volkswagen on monday introduced its new minivan touran at its wolfsburg headquarters .
it ’ s the first vw vehicle produced by workers participating in an innovative new wage model that is meant to create 5,000 new jobs in germany .
with some of highest labor costs in europe , german companies like volkswagen have increasingly hired workers in countries with lower costs .
with a rapid dwindling of manufacturing jobs in germany , vw started looking for a way to respond to the effects of globalization three years ago .
over the past 10 years , volkswagen cut one-quarter of the manufacturing jobs at its northern german wolfsburg factory .
at the same time , vw factories were established abroad , mainly in eastern europe , creating 80,000 jobs outside germany .
protests for jobs when vw considered building a new plant abroad to build the touran minivan both workers ’ representatives and the firm ’ s influential shareholder , the german state of lower saxony , protested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , mitglied des vorstands der volkswagen ag vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- then came up with the idea of recruiting unemployed automobile workers and paying them on the basis of meeting production targets for high-quality work in response to market demand .
the workers would be required to undergo regular training to deal with changing needs .
though they initially supported it , union leaders soured on the plan , partly because they saw it as a threat to fixed working hours .
when negotiations broke down between peter hartz and workers ’ representative klaus volkert in june 2000 , chancellor gerhard schröder personally stepped in to encourage the two sides to find a solution .
a victory for the car manufacturer allowed the pilot project to start for a period of 3.5 years beginning in october 2002 .
an innovative plan hartz ’ s scheme sets the monthly salary at € 2,535 -lrb- $ 2,675 -rrb- .
although not a bad wage , it is around 20 percent less than a worker with a normal vw contract earns .
employees are required to work more flexible hours than the norm , and they are not only paid based on hours worked , but also according to their ability to reach production targets .
if a production team makes a mistake or fails to fulfill its guidelines , the team has to work overtime .
" i have to see to it that everything runs smoothly in my area , " one employee explained to dw-radio .
" when i make a mistake , the next work station is disrupted .
he has to wait and can ’ t continue working .
one work station depends on the next .
you have to be able to rely on your colleagues . "
creation of the new positions in german also required some tough compromises for workers .
the new wage model doesn ’ t allow for bonuses for working on saturday or for christmas or vacations , all of which are still the norm in germany .
but vw does provide bonuses for teams that reach their targets .
second-class jobs trade union functionaries and " normal " vw employees are concerned about the effects of second-class jobs .
" i don ’ t know if it ’ s so great that 5,000 people get work under these conditions the way vw envisages , " an employee told dw-radio .
" the working hours are extremely long .
they expect very great efforts from people that isn ’ t expected from those working next to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a volkswagen logo is hoisted to the top of the tv tower of hanover , northern germany , in this may 10 , 2000 file photo .
europe 's biggest automaker volkswagen reported on wednesday , oct .
30 , 2002 that net profit dropped by 51 percent in the third quarter even as sales recovered , citing less favorable exchange rates and other factors .
-lrb- ap photo / fabian bimmer -rrb- volkswagen ceo bernd pischetsrieder views the wage model as an important contribution to germany industry ’ s ability to compete .
" creating jobs in industry in germany is crucially linked to what we can do better here than in other countries : better training , better infrastructure , better networking in the systems , in people cooperating and also in the social partnership , " he says .
peter hartz announced on monday that of the 35,000 people who had applied for the new jobs , 2,510 had been hired .
another 3,500 are to be hired by may , he said .
hartz , who was recruited last year by chancellor schröder to propose reforms aimed at slashing high unemployment in germany , is convinced that his model will pay off .
he hopes that " it will set a precedent and that we never have to produce a car outside of germany - unless it ’ s for market reasons . "
vw intends to produce 200,000 tourans in wolfsburg over the next three years .
the six-gear minivans will cost around € 20,000 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three reforms forward , two reforms back the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .

but critics say it is creating an employee underclass . german carmaker volkswagen on monday introduced its new minivan touran at its wolfsburg headquarters .
it ’ s the first vw vehicle produced by workers participating in an innovative new wage model that is meant to create 5,000 new jobs in germany .
with some of highest labor costs in europe , german companies like volkswagen have increasingly hired workers in countries with lower costs .
with a rapid dwindling of manufacturing jobs in germany , vw started looking for a way to respond to the effects of globalization three years ago .
over the past 10 years , volkswagen cut one-quarter of the manufacturing jobs at its northern german wolfsburg factory .
at the same time , vw factories were established abroad , mainly in eastern europe , creating 80,000 jobs outside germany .

although not a bad wage , it is around 20 percent less than a worker with a normal vw contract earns .
employees are required to work more flexible hours than the norm , and they are not only paid based on hours worked , but also according to their ability to reach production targets .
if a production team makes a mistake or fails to fulfill its guidelines , the team has to work overtime .

" when i make a mistake , the next work station is disrupted .
he has to wait and can ’ t continue working .
one work station depends on the next .
you have to be able to rely on your colleagues . "
creation of the new positions in german also required some tough compromises for workers .
the new wage model doesn ’ t allow for bonuses for working on saturday or for christmas or vacations , all of which are still the norm in germany .

but critics say it is creating an employee underclass . german carmaker volkswagen on monday introduced its new minivan touran at its wolfsburg headquarters .
it ’ s the first vw vehicle produced by workers participating in an innovative new wage model that is meant to create 5,000 new jobs in germany .
with some of highest labor costs in europe , german companies like volkswagen have increasingly hired workers in countries with lower costs .
with a rapid dwindling of manufacturing jobs in germany , vw started looking for a way to respond to the effects of globalization three years ago .
over the past 10 years , volkswagen cut one-quarter of the manufacturing jobs at its northern german wolfsburg factory .
at the same time , vw factories were established abroad , mainly in eastern europe , creating 80,000 jobs outside germany .
protests for jobs when vw considered building a new plant abroad to build the touran minivan both workers ’ representatives and the firm ’ s influential shareholder , the german state of lower saxony , protested .

the workers would be required to undergo regular training to deal with changing needs .
though they initially supported it , union leaders soured on the plan , partly because they saw it as a threat to fixed working hours .
when negotiations broke down between peter hartz and workers ’ representative klaus volkert in june 2000 , chancellor gerhard schröder personally stepped in to encourage the two sides to find a solution .
a victory for the car manufacturer allowed the pilot project to start for a period of 3.5 years beginning in october 2002 .
an innovative plan hartz ’ s scheme sets the monthly salary at € 2,535 -lrb- $ 2,675 -rrb- .
although not a bad wage , it is around 20 percent less than a worker with a normal vw contract earns .
employees are required to work more flexible hours than the norm , and they are not only paid based on hours worked , but also according to their ability to reach production targets .
if a production team makes a mistake or fails to fulfill its guidelines , the team has to work overtime .
" i have to see to it that everything runs smoothly in my area , " one employee explained to dw-radio .
" when i make a mistake , the next work station is disrupted .
he has to wait and can ’ t continue working .
one work station depends on the next .
you have to be able to rely on your colleagues . "
creation of the new positions in german also required some tough compromises for workers .
the new wage model doesn ’ t allow for bonuses for working on saturday or for christmas or vacations , all of which are still the norm in germany .
but vw does provide bonuses for teams that reach their targets .
second-class jobs trade union functionaries and " normal " vw employees are concerned about the effects of second-class jobs .
" i don ’ t know if it ’ s so great that 5,000 people get work under these conditions the way vw envisages , " an employee told dw-radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.01.2003 the 9 lives of beethoven 's ninth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's original score on sunday , beethoven 's ninth symphony will be named one of unesco 's official cultural heritage treasures .
it marks the end of a long journey for a manuscript that survived wars and was split by the cold war . whether at the german reunification celebration , the olympic games or a tv gala , when things get festive , beethoven 's ninth symphony is ubiquitous .
now the classical favorite , with text from friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy , " is being lauded by the world 's top cultural leaders : the original score of the ninth symphony will be officially recorded at a unesco " memory of the world " celebration on sunday featuring the philharmonic of the nations conducted by justus frantz .
the nearly 200-page manuscript is one of the most important documents in the music department of berlin 's state library , where other important originals by bach , mozart and mendelssohn bartholdy are kept .
for library director graham jefcoate , the manuscript is a special treasure .
no other symphonic work has had such a broad impact as ludwig van beethoven 's opus 125 in d-minor .
nearly the entire work , as written by beethoven between 1822 and 1824 , is at the library on unter den linden .
just two pages from the second movement are housed at the beethoven house , site of the composer 's birth , in bonn and three folios from the finale at the bibliotheque nationale in paris .
because the manuscript is in raw form , with many corrections written in , it is difficult to read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven monument in bonn .
as beethoven 's work debuted on may 7 , 1824 , in vienna 's kärntnertortheater , the 53-year-old master stood at the conductor 's side and helped keep the rhythm with a baton .
a listener reported later how beethoven , who was already suffering from increasing hearing loss , only noticed the applause after a little while and then gave an awkward thanks to his audience .
after the composer 's death in 1827 , the text fell into the hands of his biographer , anton schindler .
and in 1846 , parts of it went to the royal library in berlin , which gave the donor a stipend .
after the viennese publishing family ataria donated the final portion to the library in 1901 , the original was mostly complete .
divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it marks the end of a long journey for a manuscript that survived wars and was split by the cold war . whether at the german reunification celebration , the olympic games or a tv gala , when things get festive , beethoven 's ninth symphony is ubiquitous .
now the classical favorite , with text from friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy , " is being lauded by the world 's top cultural leaders : the original score of the ninth symphony will be officially recorded at a unesco " memory of the world " celebration on sunday featuring the philharmonic of the nations conducted by justus frantz .
the nearly 200-page manuscript is one of the most important documents in the music department of berlin 's state library , where other important originals by bach , mozart and mendelssohn bartholdy are kept .
for library director graham jefcoate , the manuscript is a special treasure .
no other symphonic work has had such a broad impact as ludwig van beethoven 's opus 125 in d-minor .
nearly the entire work , as written by beethoven between 1822 and 1824 , is at the library on unter den linden .
just two pages from the second movement are housed at the beethoven house , site of the composer 's birth , in bonn and three folios from the finale at the bibliotheque nationale in paris .
because the manuscript is in raw form , with many corrections written in , it is difficult to read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven monument in bonn .
as beethoven 's work debuted on may 7 , 1824 , in vienna 's kärntnertortheater , the 53-year-old master stood at the conductor 's side and helped keep the rhythm with a baton .
a listener reported later how beethoven , who was already suffering from increasing hearing loss , only noticed the applause after a little while and then gave an awkward thanks to his audience .
after the composer 's death in 1827 , the text fell into the hands of his biographer , anton schindler .
and in 1846 , parts of it went to the royal library in berlin , which gave the donor a stipend .
after the viennese publishing family ataria donated the final portion to the library in 1901 , the original was mostly complete .
divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

a listener reported later how beethoven , who was already suffering from increasing hearing loss , only noticed the applause after a little while and then gave an awkward thanks to his audience .
after the composer 's death in 1827 , the text fell into the hands of his biographer , anton schindler .
and in 1846 , parts of it went to the royal library in berlin , which gave the donor a stipend .
after the viennese publishing family ataria donated the final portion to the library in 1901 , the original was mostly complete .
divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it marks the end of a long journey for a manuscript that survived wars and was split by the cold war . whether at the german reunification celebration , the olympic games or a tv gala , when things get festive , beethoven 's ninth symphony is ubiquitous .
now the classical favorite , with text from friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy , " is being lauded by the world 's top cultural leaders : the original score of the ninth symphony will be officially recorded at a unesco " memory of the world " celebration on sunday featuring the philharmonic of the nations conducted by justus frantz .
the nearly 200-page manuscript is one of the most important documents in the music department of berlin 's state library , where other important originals by bach , mozart and mendelssohn bartholdy are kept .
for library director graham jefcoate , the manuscript is a special treasure .
no other symphonic work has had such a broad impact as ludwig van beethoven 's opus 125 in d-minor .
nearly the entire work , as written by beethoven between 1822 and 1824 , is at the library on unter den linden .
just two pages from the second movement are housed at the beethoven house , site of the composer 's birth , in bonn and three folios from the finale at the bibliotheque nationale in paris .
because the manuscript is in raw form , with many corrections written in , it is difficult to read .

it marks the end of a long journey for a manuscript that survived wars and was split by the cold war . whether at the german reunification celebration , the olympic games or a tv gala , when things get festive , beethoven 's ninth symphony is ubiquitous .
now the classical favorite , with text from friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy , " is being lauded by the world 's top cultural leaders : the original score of the ninth symphony will be officially recorded at a unesco " memory of the world " celebration on sunday featuring the philharmonic of the nations conducted by justus frantz .
the nearly 200-page manuscript is one of the most important documents in the music department of berlin 's state library , where other important originals by bach , mozart and mendelssohn bartholdy are kept .
for library director graham jefcoate , the manuscript is a special treasure .
no other symphonic work has had such a broad impact as ludwig van beethoven 's opus 125 in d-minor .
nearly the entire work , as written by beethoven between 1822 and 1824 , is at the library on unter den linden .
just two pages from the second movement are housed at the beethoven house , site of the composer 's birth , in bonn and three folios from the finale at the bibliotheque nationale in paris .
because the manuscript is in raw form , with many corrections written in , it is difficult to read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven monument in bonn .
as beethoven 's work debuted on may 7 , 1824 , in vienna 's kärntnertortheater , the 53-year-old master stood at the conductor 's side and helped keep the rhythm with a baton .
a listener reported later how beethoven , who was already suffering from increasing hearing loss , only noticed the applause after a little while and then gave an awkward thanks to his audience .
after the composer 's death in 1827 , the text fell into the hands of his biographer , anton schindler .
and in 1846 , parts of it went to the royal library in berlin , which gave the donor a stipend .
after the viennese publishing family ataria donated the final portion to the library in 1901 , the original was mostly complete .
divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but critics say it is creating an employee underclass . german carmaker volkswagen on monday introduced its new minivan touran at its wolfsburg headquarters .
it ’ s the first vw vehicle produced by workers participating in an innovative new wage model that is meant to create 5,000 new jobs in germany .
with some of highest labor costs in europe , german companies like volkswagen have increasingly hired workers in countries with lower costs .
with a rapid dwindling of manufacturing jobs in germany , vw started looking for a way to respond to the effects of globalization three years ago .
over the past 10 years , volkswagen cut one-quarter of the manufacturing jobs at its northern german wolfsburg factory .
at the same time , vw factories were established abroad , mainly in eastern europe , creating 80,000 jobs outside germany .

it marks the end of a long journey for a manuscript that survived wars and was split by the cold war . whether at the german reunification celebration , the olympic games or a tv gala , when things get festive , beethoven 's ninth symphony is ubiquitous .
now the classical favorite , with text from friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy , " is being lauded by the world 's top cultural leaders : the original score of the ninth symphony will be officially recorded at a unesco " memory of the world " celebration on sunday featuring the philharmonic of the nations conducted by justus frantz .
the nearly 200-page manuscript is one of the most important documents in the music department of berlin 's state library , where other important originals by bach , mozart and mendelssohn bartholdy are kept .
for library director graham jefcoate , the manuscript is a special treasure .
no other symphonic work has had such a broad impact as ludwig van beethoven 's opus 125 in d-minor .
nearly the entire work , as written by beethoven between 1822 and 1824 , is at the library on unter den linden .
just two pages from the second movement are housed at the beethoven house , site of the composer 's birth , in bonn and three folios from the finale at the bibliotheque nationale in paris .
because the manuscript is in raw form , with many corrections written in , it is difficult to read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven monument in bonn .
as beethoven 's work debuted on may 7 , 1824 , in vienna 's kärntnertortheater , the 53-year-old master stood at the conductor 's side and helped keep the rhythm with a baton .
a listener reported later how beethoven , who was already suffering from increasing hearing loss , only noticed the applause after a little while and then gave an awkward thanks to his audience .
after the composer 's death in 1827 , the text fell into the hands of his biographer , anton schindler .
and in 1846 , parts of it went to the royal library in berlin , which gave the donor a stipend .
after the viennese publishing family ataria donated the final portion to the library in 1901 , the original was mostly complete .
divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

just not as good as before .
after party rules forced them from their posts in december , former green party chiefs claudia roth and fritz kuhn have been assigned new positions . they fought to the bitter end to try and save their jobs as one half of one of the most successful leadership duos germany 's green party had ever had .
but on monday , they landed new ones . but , in the end , at a party conference in hanover last december , delegates voted narrowly against ignoring a party rule which would enable claudia roth and fritz kuhn to keep their jobs as leaders of the greens .
greens at the conference in december elected angelika beer , a 45-year-old defense expert , and reinhard bütikofer , the greens ' 49-year-old national party manager , as the party 's new co-chairs . roth and kuhn had previously led the greens to their best-ever result in german parliamentary elections last september and had also won their own seats in the bundestag .
however , under green party rules , members are prevented from simultaneously holding a party post and an elected office . a tough job hunt on monday , the party announced new positions for roth and kuhn after a difficult search and uneasy compromises . kuhn will head up a new parliamentary working group for the economy and labor market , while roth is to share the role of spokeswoman on cultural issues with antje vollmer . the search for new jobs for the two has not passed off without causing resentment within party .
kuhn was originally supposed to take up the role of economic policy spokesperson for the party before a more permanent job could be found for him .
but the current economic policy spokesman , werner schulz , refused to give up his job to make room for kuhn .
nor did vollmer want to give up her role as cultural affairs spokeswoman . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german green party faces reshuffle at top germany ’ s green party has two new faces at the helm – defense expert angelika beer and national party manager reinhard bütikofer .

but critics say it is creating an employee underclass . german carmaker volkswagen on monday introduced its new minivan touran at its wolfsburg headquarters .
it ’ s the first vw vehicle produced by workers participating in an innovative new wage model that is meant to create 5,000 new jobs in germany .
with some of highest labor costs in europe , german companies like volkswagen have increasingly hired workers in countries with lower costs .
with a rapid dwindling of manufacturing jobs in germany , vw started looking for a way to respond to the effects of globalization three years ago .
over the past 10 years , volkswagen cut one-quarter of the manufacturing jobs at its northern german wolfsburg factory .

but critics say it is creating an employee underclass . german carmaker volkswagen on monday introduced its new minivan touran at its wolfsburg headquarters .
it ’ s the first vw vehicle produced by workers participating in an innovative new wage model that is meant to create 5,000 new jobs in germany .
with some of highest labor costs in europe , german companies like volkswagen have increasingly hired workers in countries with lower costs .
with a rapid dwindling of manufacturing jobs in germany , vw started looking for a way to respond to the effects of globalization three years ago .
over the past 10 years , volkswagen cut one-quarter of the manufacturing jobs at its northern german wolfsburg factory .
at the same time , vw factories were established abroad , mainly in eastern europe , creating 80,000 jobs outside germany .
protests for jobs when vw considered building a new plant abroad to build the touran minivan both workers ’ representatives and the firm ’ s influential shareholder , the german state of lower saxony , protested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz , mitglied des vorstands der volkswagen ag vw personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- then came up with the idea of recruiting unemployed automobile workers and paying them on the basis of meeting production targets for high-quality work in response to market demand .
the workers would be required to undergo regular training to deal with changing needs .
though they initially supported it , union leaders soured on the plan , partly because they saw it as a threat to fixed working hours .
when negotiations broke down between peter hartz and workers ’ representative klaus volkert in june 2000 , chancellor gerhard schröder personally stepped in to encourage the two sides to find a solution .
a victory for the car manufacturer allowed the pilot project to start for a period of 3.5 years beginning in october 2002 .
an innovative plan hartz ’ s scheme sets the monthly salary at € 2,535 -lrb- $ 2,675 -rrb- .
although not a bad wage , it is around 20 percent less than a worker with a normal vw contract earns .
employees are required to work more flexible hours than the norm , and they are not only paid based on hours worked , but also according to their ability to reach production targets .
if a production team makes a mistake or fails to fulfill its guidelines , the team has to work overtime .
" i have to see to it that everything runs smoothly in my area , " one employee explained to dw-radio .
" when i make a mistake , the next work station is disrupted .
he has to wait and can ’ t continue working .
one work station depends on the next .
you have to be able to rely on your colleagues . "
creation of the new positions in german also required some tough compromises for workers .
the new wage model doesn ’ t allow for bonuses for working on saturday or for christmas or vacations , all of which are still the norm in germany .
but vw does provide bonuses for teams that reach their targets .
second-class jobs trade union functionaries and " normal " vw employees are concerned about the effects of second-class jobs .
" i don ’ t know if it ’ s so great that 5,000 people get work under these conditions the way vw envisages , " an employee told dw-radio .
" the working hours are extremely long .
they expect very great efforts from people that isn ’ t expected from those working next to them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.01.2003 the 9 lives of beethoven 's ninth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's original score on sunday , beethoven 's ninth symphony will be named one of unesco 's official cultural heritage treasures .
it marks the end of a long journey for a manuscript that survived wars and was split by the cold war . whether at the german reunification celebration , the olympic games or a tv gala , when things get festive , beethoven 's ninth symphony is ubiquitous .
now the classical favorite , with text from friedrich schiller 's " ode to joy , " is being lauded by the world 's top cultural leaders : the original score of the ninth symphony will be officially recorded at a unesco " memory of the world " celebration on sunday featuring the philharmonic of the nations conducted by justus frantz .
the nearly 200-page manuscript is one of the most important documents in the music department of berlin 's state library , where other important originals by bach , mozart and mendelssohn bartholdy are kept .
for library director graham jefcoate , the manuscript is a special treasure .
no other symphonic work has had such a broad impact as ludwig van beethoven 's opus 125 in d-minor .
nearly the entire work , as written by beethoven between 1822 and 1824 , is at the library on unter den linden .
just two pages from the second movement are housed at the beethoven house , site of the composer 's birth , in bonn and three folios from the finale at the bibliotheque nationale in paris .
because the manuscript is in raw form , with many corrections written in , it is difficult to read .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig van beethoven monument in bonn .
as beethoven 's work debuted on may 7 , 1824 , in vienna 's kärntnertortheater , the 53-year-old master stood at the conductor 's side and helped keep the rhythm with a baton .
a listener reported later how beethoven , who was already suffering from increasing hearing loss , only noticed the applause after a little while and then gave an awkward thanks to his audience .
after the composer 's death in 1827 , the text fell into the hands of his biographer , anton schindler .
and in 1846 , parts of it went to the royal library in berlin , which gave the donor a stipend .
after the viennese publishing family ataria donated the final portion to the library in 1901 , the original was mostly complete .
divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

divided by war and the berlin wall in order to protect the manuscript during world war ii , the prussian state library divided it into three parts and stored them in three different locations outside berlin beginning in 1941 .
their aim was to make the risk of a total loss of the document as small as possible .
only after completing an odyssey that took pieces of the document as far away as the southern german city of tübingen to the hamlet of altmarrin in the northern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , did the core pieces of the document reach the prussian cultural heritage foundation in 1967 in what was then west berlin .
seven years later , the polish government returned the remaining pages to the then-east german government .
still , one of music history 's most-important legacies remained divided by the cold war for 40 years .
ironically , after the fall of the wall in 1989 , when the manuscript was finally unified , restoration workers found that the pages of beethoven 's ninth had been torn right between , of all places , the double fugue in the key movement in which beethoven evokes universal joy and brotherhood . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

more than 9,000 londoners have taken part in a wildlife survey researching the decline of the city 's sparrow population .
experts are trying to establish why numbers of the much loved " cockney sparrow " have fallen dramatically over the last 30 years .
the bird was once a common sight in london 's parks and gardens .
but now the survey has shown there are very few sparrows in inner london where they once used to be abundant . "
if something is wrong with the sparrow , it is vital that we find out what 's behind it " ken livingstone , mayor of london research is under way by a number of organisations such , as the royal society for the protection of birds , to find possible reasons for the decline .
however , the london biodiversity partnership -lrb- lbp -rrb- called on the city 's residents to help identify where the sparrows are .
residents counted almost 75,000 sparrows - but most were seen in outer areas rather than in the city and westminster .
house sparrows were seen at 73 % of participating homes - ranging from 94 % in havering to 17 % in westminster .
expert theories the survey also found that the birds were more likely to nest in homes built before 1945 than in newer homes .
london mayor ken livingstone , who heads the lbp 's house sparrow species action plan , said : " the sparrow is part of london 's identity and their friendliness has helped make wildlife accessible to all londoners .
" their decline should worry us all - the sparrow 's world is our world .
if something is wrong with the sparrow , it is vital that we find out what 's behind it . "
more than 2,600 sparrows were counted in kensington gardens in 1925 but numbers dropped to 885 in 1948 , 544 in 1975 , 81 in 1995 and only eight in october 2000 .
theories on the cause have ranged from a lack of nesting sites to competition for food from other birds , but so far no-one has been able to say for sure .
londoners took part in the survey between 18 june and 12 july 2002 .

a highly critical report said education and learning wales -lrb- elwa -rrb- was responsible for a series of failures in financial management , meaning it issued 21 contracts in 2000/01 without permission .
the auditor general for wales , sir john bourn , blamed the use of five differing financial systems inherited from the training and enterprise councils -lrb- tecs -rrb- which elwa unified on its creation in april 2001 .
what is elwa ?
budget of £ 500m from welsh assembly government runs all post-16 education and training aims for 36,000 more students in education by 2003 answers to cardiff bay administration click for more on further education in wales the organisation - which has a £ 500m budget - has trumpeted its performance in its own report , also published on tuesday , which shows it exceeded targets last year .
elwa has responsibility for planning , funding and promoting school leavers ' education and training .
it is charged by the welsh assembly government with greatly increasing the number of people involved in learning - a key pledge .
read this in welsh but the audit report found elwa 's decision to retain the regional tecs ' financial systems and not introduce its own during the handover period meant it had not given " adequate consideration to some risks of these differing practices " .
there was also a risk from operating dispersed functions from several different offices across wales .
as a result , the new body issued 21 contracts for services in the financial year ending 31 march , 2002 - without telling its masters at the welsh assembly .
elwa targets exceded students in fe -lrb- + 1 % -rrb- modern apprentice qualifications -lrb- + 20 % -rrb- modern skills diploma for adults workers -lrb- + 29 % -rrb- ' investors in people ' employers -lrb- + 29 % -rrb- individual learning accounts opened -lrb- + 17 % -rrb- teachers on industry placements -lrb- + 16 % -rrb- source : elwa annual report it later sought retrospective permission , but education minister jane davidson refused to pay out for 14 of the deals .
" it is a matter of concern that a body charged with conducting public business should demonstrate these shortcomings , " sir john bourn said .
" these weaknesses were matters which management should have addressed from the outset . "
he even pointed to a later independent report , which found staff lacked awareness of procedures and sometimes wrote letters to arrange contracts without making a fee clear .
performance claim elwa has now sought to tighten up its financial dealings .
its first annual report shows it exceded targets including those for students in further education and modern apprenticeship qualifications .
" we had the task of delivering the inherited plans of six very different organisations from the public and private sectors , each with their own working practices and systems , " said chief executive steve martin .
" at the same time , we had to shape radical change to improve learning and lay the plans which have enabled us to reduce staffing from the 623 posts we inherited to fewer than 500 now . " watch / listen on this story dafydd wigley am " there are irregularities which should n't have occurred . "
