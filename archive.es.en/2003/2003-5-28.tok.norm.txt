in the next few years europeans will be tossing out their maps and navigating city streets with galileo , the european space agency ’ s global navigation system , which has just received approval for launching . five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today sailors and pilots still look towards the sky , but the stars have been replaced by satellites .
orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
this will change in the next five years now that the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has given the green light for the development of europe ’ s first global navigation system , galileo .
designed as a competitor to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , galileo represents a concerted attempt by 15 european states to gain a foothold in the growing market for satellite navigation services .
the project , which was approved by european ministers on monday , will be test-started in 2005 and carries a price tag of more than three billion euros , to be divided up between the esa and the european union .
expensive technology benefits everyone the investment is well worth it , volker liebig , director of germany ’ s aerospace center in bonn , told dw-world , because everyone will profit from it .
there will be a so-called ‘ safety of life service ’ feature , for instance , which sends out a signal whenever a ship or plane is in distress .
plus , with 30 satellites in orbit and two control centers on the ground , galileo reaches the most remote places in the african desert or the brazilian rainforest , making navigation as easy as in downtown new york or tokyo .
starting in 2008 , when galileo is fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
" what one pays for is a particular service such as management of an entire shipping fleet or the coordination of trucks , where more than just the pure positioning signal is involved , " says liebig .
that means a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
manfred stolpe , germany ’ s transportation minister applauded the esa decision saying that satellite navigation is of " great importance to the country ’ s economy and transportation policy , " and that the galileo system presents " a big chance for german and european industry . "
competition for u.s. system the u.s. government , however , is less than enthusiastic about europe developing its own navigation satellite system .
last year the u.s. state department announced that the american gps system should be adopted as the worldwide standard , and that there was no compelling reason for galileo .
in the past the u.s. has also voiced concern that galileo could become a security threat because it offers open access to its positioning system .
the american gps system , which depends on military satellites under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
this was the case during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
such action has been sharply criticized by the europeans and is one of the reasons galileo was conceived .
" there are those in america who are not in favor of europe becoming independent in the field of satellite navigation , " liebig says , " but i believe one is much more respected as a partner , when one develops his own capabilities . "
the eu commission seems to agree , and as one speaker put it , galileo is absolutely necessary because " we don ’ t like monopolies . " kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galileo gets go-ahead the european union will put up € 450 million to develop galileo , the eu 's satellite navigations system , which it says will be more advanced , powerful and reliable than its u.s. counterpart -lrb- march 27 , 2003 -rrb- .

supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .

competition for u.s. system the u.s. government , however , is less than enthusiastic about europe developing its own navigation satellite system .
last year the u.s. state department announced that the american gps system should be adopted as the worldwide standard , and that there was no compelling reason for galileo .
in the past the u.s. has also voiced concern that galileo could become a security threat because it offers open access to its positioning system .
the american gps system , which depends on military satellites under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
this was the case during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
such action has been sharply criticized by the europeans and is one of the reasons galileo was conceived .

in the next few years europeans will be tossing out their maps and navigating city streets with galileo , the european space agency ’ s global navigation system , which has just received approval for launching . five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today sailors and pilots still look towards the sky , but the stars have been replaced by satellites .
orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
this will change in the next five years now that the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has given the green light for the development of europe ’ s first global navigation system , galileo .
designed as a competitor to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , galileo represents a concerted attempt by 15 european states to gain a foothold in the growing market for satellite navigation services .
the project , which was approved by european ministers on monday , will be test-started in 2005 and carries a price tag of more than three billion euros , to be divided up between the esa and the european union .
expensive technology benefits everyone the investment is well worth it , volker liebig , director of germany ’ s aerospace center in bonn , told dw-world , because everyone will profit from it .
there will be a so-called ‘ safety of life service ’ feature , for instance , which sends out a signal whenever a ship or plane is in distress .
plus , with 30 satellites in orbit and two control centers on the ground , galileo reaches the most remote places in the african desert or the brazilian rainforest , making navigation as easy as in downtown new york or tokyo .
starting in 2008 , when galileo is fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
" what one pays for is a particular service such as management of an entire shipping fleet or the coordination of trucks , where more than just the pure positioning signal is involved , " says liebig .
that means a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .

in the next few years europeans will be tossing out their maps and navigating city streets with galileo , the european space agency ’ s global navigation system , which has just received approval for launching . five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today sailors and pilots still look towards the sky , but the stars have been replaced by satellites .
orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
this will change in the next five years now that the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has given the green light for the development of europe ’ s first global navigation system , galileo .
designed as a competitor to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , galileo represents a concerted attempt by 15 european states to gain a foothold in the growing market for satellite navigation services .
the project , which was approved by european ministers on monday , will be test-started in 2005 and carries a price tag of more than three billion euros , to be divided up between the esa and the european union .
expensive technology benefits everyone the investment is well worth it , volker liebig , director of germany ’ s aerospace center in bonn , told dw-world , because everyone will profit from it .
there will be a so-called ‘ safety of life service ’ feature , for instance , which sends out a signal whenever a ship or plane is in distress .
plus , with 30 satellites in orbit and two control centers on the ground , galileo reaches the most remote places in the african desert or the brazilian rainforest , making navigation as easy as in downtown new york or tokyo .
starting in 2008 , when galileo is fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
" what one pays for is a particular service such as management of an entire shipping fleet or the coordination of trucks , where more than just the pure positioning signal is involved , " says liebig .
that means a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
manfred stolpe , germany ’ s transportation minister applauded the esa decision saying that satellite navigation is of " great importance to the country ’ s economy and transportation policy , " and that the galileo system presents " a big chance for german and european industry . "
competition for u.s. system the u.s. government , however , is less than enthusiastic about europe developing its own navigation satellite system .
last year the u.s. state department announced that the american gps system should be adopted as the worldwide standard , and that there was no compelling reason for galileo .
in the past the u.s. has also voiced concern that galileo could become a security threat because it offers open access to its positioning system .
the american gps system , which depends on military satellites under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
this was the case during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
such action has been sharply criticized by the europeans and is one of the reasons galileo was conceived .
" there are those in america who are not in favor of europe becoming independent in the field of satellite navigation , " liebig says , " but i believe one is much more respected as a partner , when one develops his own capabilities . "
the eu commission seems to agree , and as one speaker put it , galileo is absolutely necessary because " we don ’ t like monopolies .

in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
" what one pays for is a particular service such as management of an entire shipping fleet or the coordination of trucks , where more than just the pure positioning signal is involved , " says liebig .
that means a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
manfred stolpe , germany ’ s transportation minister applauded the esa decision saying that satellite navigation is of " great importance to the country ’ s economy and transportation policy , " and that the galileo system presents " a big chance for german and european industry . "
competition for u.s. system the u.s. government , however , is less than enthusiastic about europe developing its own navigation satellite system .
last year the u.s. state department announced that the american gps system should be adopted as the worldwide standard , and that there was no compelling reason for galileo .
in the past the u.s. has also voiced concern that galileo could become a security threat because it offers open access to its positioning system .
the american gps system , which depends on military satellites under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
this was the case during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
such action has been sharply criticized by the europeans and is one of the reasons galileo was conceived .

in the next few years europeans will be tossing out their maps and navigating city streets with galileo , the european space agency ’ s global navigation system , which has just received approval for launching . five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today sailors and pilots still look towards the sky , but the stars have been replaced by satellites .
orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
this will change in the next five years now that the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has given the green light for the development of europe ’ s first global navigation system , galileo .
designed as a competitor to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , galileo represents a concerted attempt by 15 european states to gain a foothold in the growing market for satellite navigation services .
the project , which was approved by european ministers on monday , will be test-started in 2005 and carries a price tag of more than three billion euros , to be divided up between the esa and the european union .
expensive technology benefits everyone the investment is well worth it , volker liebig , director of germany ’ s aerospace center in bonn , told dw-world , because everyone will profit from it .
there will be a so-called ‘ safety of life service ’ feature , for instance , which sends out a signal whenever a ship or plane is in distress .

in the next few years europeans will be tossing out their maps and navigating city streets with galileo , the european space agency ’ s global navigation system , which has just received approval for launching . five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today sailors and pilots still look towards the sky , but the stars have been replaced by satellites .
orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
this will change in the next five years now that the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has given the green light for the development of europe ’ s first global navigation system , galileo .
designed as a competitor to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , galileo represents a concerted attempt by 15 european states to gain a foothold in the growing market for satellite navigation services .
the project , which was approved by european ministers on monday , will be test-started in 2005 and carries a price tag of more than three billion euros , to be divided up between the esa and the european union .
expensive technology benefits everyone the investment is well worth it , volker liebig , director of germany ’ s aerospace center in bonn , told dw-world , because everyone will profit from it .
there will be a so-called ‘ safety of life service ’ feature , for instance , which sends out a signal whenever a ship or plane is in distress .
plus , with 30 satellites in orbit and two control centers on the ground , galileo reaches the most remote places in the african desert or the brazilian rainforest , making navigation as easy as in downtown new york or tokyo .
starting in 2008 , when galileo is fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
" what one pays for is a particular service such as management of an entire shipping fleet or the coordination of trucks , where more than just the pure positioning signal is involved , " says liebig .
that means a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
manfred stolpe , germany ’ s transportation minister applauded the esa decision saying that satellite navigation is of " great importance to the country ’ s economy and transportation policy , " and that the galileo system presents " a big chance for german and european industry . "
competition for u.s. system the u.s. government , however , is less than enthusiastic about europe developing its own navigation satellite system .
last year the u.s. state department announced that the american gps system should be adopted as the worldwide standard , and that there was no compelling reason for galileo .
in the past the u.s. has also voiced concern that galileo could become a security threat because it offers open access to its positioning system .
the american gps system , which depends on military satellites under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
this was the case during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
such action has been sharply criticized by the europeans and is one of the reasons galileo was conceived .
" there are those in america who are not in favor of europe becoming independent in the field of satellite navigation , " liebig says , " but i believe one is much more respected as a partner , when one develops his own capabilities . "
the eu commission seems to agree , and as one speaker put it , galileo is absolutely necessary because " we don ’ t like monopolies .

plus , with 30 satellites in orbit and two control centers on the ground , galileo reaches the most remote places in the african desert or the brazilian rainforest , making navigation as easy as in downtown new york or tokyo .
starting in 2008 , when galileo is fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
" what one pays for is a particular service such as management of an entire shipping fleet or the coordination of trucks , where more than just the pure positioning signal is involved , " says liebig .
that means a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
manfred stolpe , germany ’ s transportation minister applauded the esa decision saying that satellite navigation is of " great importance to the country ’ s economy and transportation policy , " and that the galileo system presents " a big chance for german and european industry . "
competition for u.s. system the u.s. government , however , is less than enthusiastic about europe developing its own navigation satellite system .
last year the u.s. state department announced that the american gps system should be adopted as the worldwide standard , and that there was no compelling reason for galileo .
in the past the u.s. has also voiced concern that galileo could become a security threat because it offers open access to its positioning system .
the american gps system , which depends on military satellites under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
this was the case during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
such action has been sharply criticized by the europeans and is one of the reasons galileo was conceived .
" there are those in america who are not in favor of europe becoming independent in the field of satellite navigation , " liebig says , " but i believe one is much more respected as a partner , when one develops his own capabilities . "

in the next few years europeans will be tossing out their maps and navigating city streets with galileo , the european space agency ’ s global navigation system , which has just received approval for launching . five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today sailors and pilots still look towards the sky , but the stars have been replaced by satellites .
orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
this will change in the next five years now that the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has given the green light for the development of europe ’ s first global navigation system , galileo .
designed as a competitor to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , galileo represents a concerted attempt by 15 european states to gain a foothold in the growing market for satellite navigation services .
the project , which was approved by european ministers on monday , will be test-started in 2005 and carries a price tag of more than three billion euros , to be divided up between the esa and the european union .

in the next few years europeans will be tossing out their maps and navigating city streets with galileo , the european space agency ’ s global navigation system , which has just received approval for launching . five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today sailors and pilots still look towards the sky , but the stars have been replaced by satellites .
orbiting at a distance of some 23,000 kilometers above the earth ’ s surface , several dozen satellites , many sent up in the late 1950s and 1960s by the united states and the soviet union for military use , provide ships and planes with a global navigation system .
in the last 10 years , the number of satellites used for commercial purposes has increased rapidly , but the united states still dominates the field , and the pentagon controls access .
this will change in the next five years now that the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has given the green light for the development of europe ’ s first global navigation system , galileo .
designed as a competitor to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , galileo represents a concerted attempt by 15 european states to gain a foothold in the growing market for satellite navigation services .
the project , which was approved by european ministers on monday , will be test-started in 2005 and carries a price tag of more than three billion euros , to be divided up between the esa and the european union .
expensive technology benefits everyone the investment is well worth it , volker liebig , director of germany ’ s aerospace center in bonn , told dw-world , because everyone will profit from it .
there will be a so-called ‘ safety of life service ’ feature , for instance , which sends out a signal whenever a ship or plane is in distress .
plus , with 30 satellites in orbit and two control centers on the ground , galileo reaches the most remote places in the african desert or the brazilian rainforest , making navigation as easy as in downtown new york or tokyo .
starting in 2008 , when galileo is fully operational , people anywhere in the world will be able to rely on the esa ’ s satellite technology for personal navigation .
in northern norway , for example , where there is no possibility of accessing global navigation systems because the current satellite network does not cover the region , a combination of galileo and special mobile phones will enable people to determine their exact position , down to the very meter , free of charge .
commercial channels , on the other hand , will charge a fee for their use .
" what one pays for is a particular service such as management of an entire shipping fleet or the coordination of trucks , where more than just the pure positioning signal is involved , " says liebig .
that means a transport company , for instance , will be able to keep track of where each one of its trucks is located , while the truck drivers themselves rely on galileo to help them navigate through foreign cities .
galileo creates employment opportunities global navigation is rapidly becoming a lucrative market .
the european states participating in the galileo project are expecting big returns on their investment .
supporters of the project predict that it will lead to the creation of some 140,000 jobs in the high-tech sector and generate € 74 billion in earnings over the next 20 years .
germany , as galileo ’ s largest financial investor hopes to profit the most from the system , and was a strong advocate in lobbying for esa approval .
manfred stolpe , germany ’ s transportation minister applauded the esa decision saying that satellite navigation is of " great importance to the country ’ s economy and transportation policy , " and that the galileo system presents " a big chance for german and european industry . "
competition for u.s. system the u.s. government , however , is less than enthusiastic about europe developing its own navigation satellite system .
last year the u.s. state department announced that the american gps system should be adopted as the worldwide standard , and that there was no compelling reason for galileo .
in the past the u.s. has also voiced concern that galileo could become a security threat because it offers open access to its positioning system .
the american gps system , which depends on military satellites under the control of the u.s. department of defense , can be downgraded or even switched off if the government believes it is being manipulated by an enemy state or a terrorist group .
this was the case during the war in kosovo when the u.s. restricted european use of the gps .
such action has been sharply criticized by the europeans and is one of the reasons galileo was conceived .
" there are those in america who are not in favor of europe becoming independent in the field of satellite navigation , " liebig says , " but i believe one is much more respected as a partner , when one develops his own capabilities . "
the eu commission seems to agree , and as one speaker put it , galileo is absolutely necessary because " we don ’ t like monopolies .

younger people are elated over a recent high court ruling which , for the first time , allowed 10 biharis to assume bangladeshi citizenship and have voting rights .
but older people despair at the enthusiasm of many of those born after the 1971 bangladesh war of independence to stay in bangladesh .
they say their true home is in pakistan .
there are just fewer than 300,000 biharis located in more than 60 camps in dhaka and across the country .
they are urdu-speaking people from the indian state of bihar who moved to bengal at the time of partition .
discrimination during the bangladesh war of independence they supported pakistan , but were denied permission to emigrate .
as a result , they faced widespread discrimination in bengali speaking bangladesh .
even today they say its harder for them to get jobs or get their children into schools .
but the mood among young people has brightened since the high court accepted a petition by a group of biharis who live in the geneva camp of central dhaka , one of the main refugee camps in the country .
the camp is notorious for its cramped conditions , poor sanitation and shortages of electricity and running water .
most people eat in communal areas with kitchens similar to those found in countless other refugee camps around the world .
but despite the deprivations , the court ruling has inspired an upbeat attitude among young people such as 21 year-old sakil hossain .
hope " i was born and bred here .
i consider bangladesh my home , even though conditions in the camp are tough and we are often discriminated against because we are not bengalis , " he said .
he says the judgement has increased hopes that people him will be given bangladeshi citizenship .
" if there was a war or a national crisis , i would be prepared to die for my country .
surely that is enough to give me citizenship , " he said .
but while sakil hossain remains ever hopeful , his family 's life long friend , 67 year-old mohammed kalil , is downbeat .
" i have been here since 1960 and for much of that time it has been a life of hardship for me , " he said .
" i want to go to pakistan because here i do n't have any land , any facilities or any future . "
mr kalil 's wife and two children went to pakistan in 1973 but because he was working outside dhaka at the time he was unable to accompany them .
by the time he had filled in the necessary paperwork the pakistan authorities refused to allow him , arguing there was not enough room for any more biharis .
' pakistani ' he is one of thousands of older refugees whose families have been separated in similar circumstances .
mr kalil says : " i was born in what was then east pakistan even if i have never been to the western part .
i still consider myself a pakistani , i do not belong here . "
meanwhile lawyers say that they intend to get citizenship for more biharis at the earliest opportunity .
" their citizenship can not be taken away just because they live in a refugee camp or because some of them may want to go to pakistan , " said saffiq chowdhury , one of the lawyers representing them .
" its time that justice was finally given to these people who time and governments have forgot . "

but despite the deprivations , the court ruling has inspired an upbeat attitude among young people such as 21 year-old sakil hossain .
hope " i was born and bred here .
i consider bangladesh my home , even though conditions in the camp are tough and we are often discriminated against because we are not bengalis , " he said .
he says the judgement has increased hopes that people him will be given bangladeshi citizenship .
" if there was a war or a national crisis , i would be prepared to die for my country .
surely that is enough to give me citizenship , " he said .
but while sakil hossain remains ever hopeful , his family 's life long friend , 67 year-old mohammed kalil , is downbeat .
for bihari children , this is the only life they have known " i have been here since 1960 and for much of that time it has been a life of hardship for me , " he said .
" i want to go to pakistan because here i do n't have any land , any facilities or any future . "
mr kalil 's wife and two children went to pakistan in 1973 but because he was working outside dhaka at the time he was unable to accompany them .
by the time he had filled in the necessary paperwork the pakistan authorities refused to allow him , arguing there was not enough room for any more biharis .

mr kalil says : " i was born in what was then east pakistan even if i have never been to the western part .

meanwhile lawyers say that they intend to get citizenship for more biharis at the earliest opportunity .
" their citizenship can not be taken away just because they live in a refugee camp or because some of them may want to go to pakistan , " said saffiq chowdhury , one of the lawyers representing them .

mohammed kalil -lrb- l -rrb- and sakil hossain -lrb- r -rrb- see things differently younger people are elated over a recent high court ruling which , for the first time , allowed 10 biharis to assume bangladeshi citizenship and have voting rights .
but older people despair at the enthusiasm of many of those born after the 1971 bangladesh war of independence to stay in bangladesh .
they say their true home is in pakistan .
there are just fewer than 300,000 biharis located in more than 60 camps in dhaka and across the country .
they are urdu-speaking people from the indian state of bihar who moved to bengal at the time of partition .
discrimination during the bangladesh war of independence they supported pakistan , but were denied permission to emigrate .
as a result , they faced widespread discrimination in bengali speaking bangladesh .
even today they say its harder for them to get jobs or get their children into schools .
young people were born after bangladesh was formed but the mood among young people has brightened since the high court accepted a petition by a group of biharis who live in the geneva camp of central dhaka , one of the main refugee camps in the country .
the camp is notorious for its cramped conditions , poor sanitation and shortages of electricity and running water .
most people eat in communal areas with kitchens similar to those found in countless other refugee camps around the world .
but despite the deprivations , the court ruling has inspired an upbeat attitude among young people such as 21 year-old sakil hossain .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- breakfast -pipe- the search for iraqi weapons news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : programmes : breakfast news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk wednesday , 28 may , 2003 , 05:15 gmt 06:15 uk the search for iraqi weapons in hull , many feel the war was ultimately justified more than two months since the start of the iraq war coalition forces in iraq have yet to find any conclusive evidence of iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
getting rid of the wmds - chemical , biological and possibly basic nuclear weapons - was one of the central aims of the war .
but so far , little evidence has been found for their existence .
and now , the american defence secretary donald rumsfeld is saying iraq may have destroyed them all before the war began .
this morning , breakfast looked at one of the war 's unanswered questions : where are the weapons of mass destruction ?
and , if there are no significant finds , was the war justified ?
jules botfield reported for us from hull .
there , she found that many people accepted the war had been necessary , even if weapons of mass destruction were never found. click here to watch jules botfield 's report from hull we crossed live to baghdad , to find out when the weapons inspectors are due back in to the country. click here to watch our interview with the bbc 's correspondent in baghdad , caroline hawley we also talked to the british journalist christopher hitchens .
he 's just written a book , re-examining our attitudes to the iraq war and president bush. click here to watch our interview in full with christopher hitchens we also asked for your views click here to go straight to our comments section , where you can read some of your e-mails on weapons of mass destruction shortly after the war began , the defence secretary geoff hoon gave this explanation of why no weapons had yet been found : " we 've known that saddam hussein was making determined efforts to hide these weapons ...
it will take some time uncover them .
" i do n't believe it is sensible to put a timetable on that - ultimately it will depend on people coming forward who have knowledge of the whereabouts of those weapons of mass destruction . "
false alarms but weeks later nothing , and the promise of a smoking gun has yet to materialise although there have been false alarms .
a few weeks ago " suspicious " artillery shells that tested positive for a chemical agent , were found in a school .
in another incident chemical weapons experts found a possible storage site for such weapons near hindiyah in central iraq .
the unidentified chemicals , found in 14 barrels at a military training site were suspected to include the nerve gas saran .
lack of evidence despite all these incidents there is still no undisputed evidence that saddam was running a chemical / biological weapons programme .
earlier this week it was reported that us inspectors have concluded that suspect vehicles discovered inside iraq are bio-weapons laboratories .
the analysts have produced a report which calls the vehicles an ' ingeniously simple , self-contained bio processing system ' .
inspectors now , united nations nuclear weapons inspectors are due to arrive back in iraq , on their first visit since the us led invasion .
but they wo n't resume their hunt for weapons of mass destruction , instead they 'll investigate reports of looting from an iraqi nuclear site .

planning permission for a six-tonne bronze statue outside the white cube gallery in hoxton square has been sought from hackney council .
' charity ' would be hirst 's largest sculpture and would coincide with an exhibition of his work at the gallery in september and october .
it is based on the little girl clutching a teddy bear and holding out a collection box for scope - then called the spastics society - seen on britain 's streets in the 1960s and 1970s .
but the little girl 's collection tin will be smashed by robbers in the scultpure .
the application from the gallery says the piece would show a " dejected and vulnerable image " and challenge the classical " idealised figure " .
it reads : " charity is the largest sculpture damien has made and on this scale it is monumental yet vulnerable . "
dolls removed after complaints the dolls were removed in the 1980s after complaints from many cerebral palsy sufferers that they were offensive .
a scope spokesman said : " we are aware of this particular work but can not comment on it as we have not seen it .

planning permission for a six-tonne bronze statue outside the white cube gallery in hoxton square has been sought from hackney council .
' charity ' would be hirst 's largest sculpture and would coincide with an exhibition of his work at the gallery in september and october .
it is based on the little girl clutching a teddy bear and holding out a collection box for scope - then called the spastics society - seen on britain 's streets in the 1960s and 1970s .
but the little girl 's collection tin will be smashed by robbers in the scultpure .
the application from the gallery says the piece would show a " dejected and vulnerable image " and challenge the classical " idealised figure " .
it reads : " charity is the largest sculpture damien has made and on this scale it is monumental yet vulnerable . "
dolls removed after complaints the dolls were removed in the 1980s after complaints from many cerebral palsy sufferers that they were offensive .
a scope spokesman said : " we are aware of this particular work but can not comment on it as we have not seen it .
" with regards to the collection dolls , they are a part of scope 's history and are well known - although outdated .
" scope now concentrates on positive portrayals of disabled people and uses imagery which more accurately reflects disabled people 's lives . "
hirst has worked with the charity before .
in february he donated a painting from his gorgeous concentric series for auction and raised £ 90,000 at sothebys for scope .
