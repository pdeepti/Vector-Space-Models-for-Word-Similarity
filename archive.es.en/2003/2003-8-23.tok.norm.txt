on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .
the investors claimed they were misled into approving the deal . although it is among the largest settlements in a shareholder class action , daimlerchrysler in the end decided $ 300 million -lrb- € 275 million -rrb- was a more attractive sum then $ 22 billion -lrb- € 20 billion -rrb- , the amount disgruntled investors were seeking in the suit that claimed the world ’ s fifth largest automaker had duped them into approving the merger of germany ’ s daimler-benz and chrysler in the united states . “ although daimlerchrysler believes the class action is completely without merit , the company has agreed to a settlement , since a local jury could have reached a different conclusion , ” the company said in a statement . the suits were filed after jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler ’ s ceo , told the financial times that he had always meant to relegate chrysler to a division of the group .
the investors , prompted by a suit already filed by billionaire kirk kerkorian , sued themselves , claiming the deal had been presented as a merger of equals , rather than a takeover , to keep the price down . kerkorian ’ s tracinda corp. once owned 14 percent of chrysler ’ s stock .
this settlement has no bearing on kerkorian ’ s suit , which daimlerchrysler has vowed to continue to fight . the final settlement is still subject to final agreement and to court approval .
the carmaker said $ 220 million of the settlement would be covered by insurers . “ that was very cheap for daimlerchrysler .
if the small shareholders get so little , kerkorian should get nothing because he was an insider , ” rolf woller , an analyst with hvb , told reuters . still , kerkorian ’ s lawyer , terry christensen , said the settlement was a positive development and said he is seeking compensatory damages for his client in the range of $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion . “ you don ’ t pay $ 300 million because it ’ s a nuisance , ” he said .

after the release of the 14 european tourists held for months by islamic extremists in the sahara desert , german authorities intend to search for the kidnappers with help from algerian and u.s. authorities . germany ’ s federal public prosecutors ’ office is preparing to issue warrants for the arrest of the hostage takers who kidnapped european adventure holidaymakers and held them for six months .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , although the kidnappers eventually released all but one hostage unharmed , berlin wants to counter the impression that it pays to kidnap germans . although terms of the hostages ’ release have not been made public , germany ’ s public broadcasters ard and zdf have reported that a 4.6 million euro -lrb- $ 5.06 million -rrb- ransom was paid to the kidnappers by germany via the malian government . “ the kidnappers should not escape unpunished , ” said chancellor gerhard schröder .
but neither he nor his government will comment on the ransom issue .
earlier , the chancellor said that he had “ good reason ” not to comment on those reports . crime does pay ? security analysts have said politicians have good reason to avoid the topic of paying ransom .
paying ransom for the release of hostages could set a dangerous precedent and has already sparked fears of a possible kidnapping spree . “ if we get the same situation as we have in colombia where you see a whole industry of ransoming and hostage-taking , it would be very disconcerting , ” peter van ham , a dutch security expert , told reuters . among those sought after is one of the leading figures in the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , amari saifi , 47 , better known by his nom de guerre abderrazak el para .

according to spiegel , authorities are also in possession of a videotape on which several additional kidnappers appear . germans at risk berlin is also anxious to dissuade other groups that kidnapping is a lucrative activity because tourism officials say germans could be especially at risk .

earlier , the chancellor said that he had “ good reason ” not to comment on those reports . crime does pay ? security analysts have said politicians have good reason to avoid the topic of paying ransom .
paying ransom for the release of hostages could set a dangerous precedent and has already sparked fears of a possible kidnapping spree . “ if we get the same situation as we have in colombia where you see a whole industry of ransoming and hostage-taking , it would be very disconcerting , ” peter van ham , a dutch security expert , told reuters . among those sought after is one of the leading figures in the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , amari saifi , 47 , better known by his nom de guerre abderrazak el para .
he claimed his group was responsible for the kidnapping in a statement faxed to journalists in algiers . the gspc , which is reputed to have several hundred members , is fighting for a purist islamic state in algeria and has been linked to the al qaeda terrorist network . in order to identify other figures involved in the abduction , german authorities began questioning the released hostages as they left the malian capital bamako on their way to freedom .
according to spiegel , authorities are also in possession of a videotape on which several additional kidnappers appear . germans at risk berlin is also anxious to dissuade other groups that kidnapping is a lucrative activity because tourism officials say germans could be especially at risk .
they are the world ’ s most frequent travellers and increasingly seek out remote destinations .
nine of the hostages were german , four were swiss and one dutch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally , the west german government has taken a hard line against kidnappers ’ demands .
that led in some cases to hostages being killed , such as hans-martin schleyer -lrb- picture -rrb- , the industrial leader kidnapped in 1977 by red army faction guerrillas .
schleyer was shot by his abductors after the government refused their demands to free imprisoned raf members . but the german stance shows signs of softening .
newspapers have reported that the german government paid nearly one million dollars in ransom in 2000 for a german woman who was being held in the southern philippines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians demand hostages pay up the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release .
sahara hostage negotiators racing against time four of the 14 remaining european tourists held by islamic rebels in northern africa are seriously ill .
renewed efforts to free the group are being taken by malian and german officials in the northern african country .

according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , although the kidnappers eventually released all but one hostage unharmed , berlin wants to counter the impression that it pays to kidnap germans . although terms of the hostages ’ release have not been made public , germany ’ s public broadcasters ard and zdf have reported that a 4.6 million euro -lrb- $ 5.06 million -rrb- ransom was paid to the kidnappers by germany via the malian government . “ the kidnappers should not escape unpunished , ” said chancellor gerhard schröder .
but neither he nor his government will comment on the ransom issue .
earlier , the chancellor said that he had “ good reason ” not to comment on those reports . crime does pay ? security analysts have said politicians have good reason to avoid the topic of paying ransom .
paying ransom for the release of hostages could set a dangerous precedent and has already sparked fears of a possible kidnapping spree . “ if we get the same situation as we have in colombia where you see a whole industry of ransoming and hostage-taking , it would be very disconcerting , ” peter van ham , a dutch security expert , told reuters . among those sought after is one of the leading figures in the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , amari saifi , 47 , better known by his nom de guerre abderrazak el para .
he claimed his group was responsible for the kidnapping in a statement faxed to journalists in algiers . the gspc , which is reputed to have several hundred members , is fighting for a purist islamic state in algeria and has been linked to the al qaeda terrorist network . in order to identify other figures involved in the abduction , german authorities began questioning the released hostages as they left the malian capital bamako on their way to freedom .
according to spiegel , authorities are also in possession of a videotape on which several additional kidnappers appear . germans at risk berlin is also anxious to dissuade other groups that kidnapping is a lucrative activity because tourism officials say germans could be especially at risk .
they are the world ’ s most frequent travellers and increasingly seek out remote destinations .
nine of the hostages were german , four were swiss and one dutch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally , the west german government has taken a hard line against kidnappers ’ demands .
that led in some cases to hostages being killed , such as hans-martin schleyer -lrb- picture -rrb- , the industrial leader kidnapped in 1977 by red army faction guerrillas .
schleyer was shot by his abductors after the government refused their demands to free imprisoned raf members . but the german stance shows signs of softening .

on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .

the investors , prompted by a suit already filed by billionaire kirk kerkorian , sued themselves , claiming the deal had been presented as a merger of equals , rather than a takeover , to keep the price down . kerkorian ’ s tracinda corp. once owned 14 percent of chrysler ’ s stock .
this settlement has no bearing on kerkorian ’ s suit , which daimlerchrysler has vowed to continue to fight . the final settlement is still subject to final agreement and to court approval .
the carmaker said $ 220 million of the settlement would be covered by insurers . “ that was very cheap for daimlerchrysler .
if the small shareholders get so little , kerkorian should get nothing because he was an insider , ” rolf woller , an analyst with hvb , told reuters . still , kerkorian ’ s lawyer , terry christensen , said the settlement was a positive development and said he is seeking compensatory damages for his client in the range of $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion . “ you don ’ t pay $ 300 million because it ’ s a nuisance , ” he said .

on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .
the investors claimed they were misled into approving the deal . although it is among the largest settlements in a shareholder class action , daimlerchrysler in the end decided $ 300 million -lrb- € 275 million -rrb- was a more attractive sum then $ 22 billion -lrb- € 20 billion -rrb- , the amount disgruntled investors were seeking in the suit that claimed the world ’ s fifth largest automaker had duped them into approving the merger of germany ’ s daimler-benz and chrysler in the united states . “ although daimlerchrysler believes the class action is completely without merit , the company has agreed to a settlement , since a local jury could have reached a different conclusion , ” the company said in a statement . the suits were filed after jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler ’ s ceo , told the financial times that he had always meant to relegate chrysler to a division of the group .
the investors , prompted by a suit already filed by billionaire kirk kerkorian , sued themselves , claiming the deal had been presented as a merger of equals , rather than a takeover , to keep the price down . kerkorian ’ s tracinda corp. once owned 14 percent of chrysler ’ s stock .
this settlement has no bearing on kerkorian ’ s suit , which daimlerchrysler has vowed to continue to fight . the final settlement is still subject to final agreement and to court approval .
the carmaker said $ 220 million of the settlement would be covered by insurers . “ that was very cheap for daimlerchrysler .
if the small shareholders get so little , kerkorian should get nothing because he was an insider , ” rolf woller , an analyst with hvb , told reuters . still , kerkorian ’ s lawyer , terry christensen , said the settlement was a positive development and said he is seeking compensatory damages for his client in the range of $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion . “ you don ’ t pay $ 300 million because it ’ s a nuisance , ” he said .

according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , although the kidnappers eventually released all but one hostage unharmed , berlin wants to counter the impression that it pays to kidnap germans . although terms of the hostages ’ release have not been made public , germany ’ s public broadcasters ard and zdf have reported that a 4.6 million euro -lrb- $ 5.06 million -rrb- ransom was paid to the kidnappers by germany via the malian government . “ the kidnappers should not escape unpunished , ” said chancellor gerhard schröder .

the investors claimed they were misled into approving the deal . although it is among the largest settlements in a shareholder class action , daimlerchrysler in the end decided $ 300 million -lrb- € 275 million -rrb- was a more attractive sum then $ 22 billion -lrb- € 20 billion -rrb- , the amount disgruntled investors were seeking in the suit that claimed the world ’ s fifth largest automaker had duped them into approving the merger of germany ’ s daimler-benz and chrysler in the united states . “ although daimlerchrysler believes the class action is completely without merit , the company has agreed to a settlement , since a local jury could have reached a different conclusion , ” the company said in a statement . the suits were filed after jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler ’ s ceo , told the financial times that he had always meant to relegate chrysler to a division of the group .
the investors , prompted by a suit already filed by billionaire kirk kerkorian , sued themselves , claiming the deal had been presented as a merger of equals , rather than a takeover , to keep the price down . kerkorian ’ s tracinda corp. once owned 14 percent of chrysler ’ s stock .
this settlement has no bearing on kerkorian ’ s suit , which daimlerchrysler has vowed to continue to fight . the final settlement is still subject to final agreement and to court approval .

if the small shareholders get so little , kerkorian should get nothing because he was an insider , ” rolf woller , an analyst with hvb , told reuters . still , kerkorian ’ s lawyer , terry christensen , said the settlement was a positive development and said he is seeking compensatory damages for his client in the range of $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion . “ you don ’ t pay $ 300 million because it ’ s a nuisance , ” he said .

after the release of the 14 european tourists held for months by islamic extremists in the sahara desert , german authorities intend to search for the kidnappers with help from algerian and u.s. authorities . germany ’ s federal public prosecutors ’ office is preparing to issue warrants for the arrest of the hostage takers who kidnapped european adventure holidaymakers and held them for six months .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , although the kidnappers eventually released all but one hostage unharmed , berlin wants to counter the impression that it pays to kidnap germans . although terms of the hostages ’ release have not been made public , germany ’ s public broadcasters ard and zdf have reported that a 4.6 million euro -lrb- $ 5.06 million -rrb- ransom was paid to the kidnappers by germany via the malian government . “ the kidnappers should not escape unpunished , ” said chancellor gerhard schröder .
but neither he nor his government will comment on the ransom issue .
earlier , the chancellor said that he had “ good reason ” not to comment on those reports . crime does pay ? security analysts have said politicians have good reason to avoid the topic of paying ransom .
paying ransom for the release of hostages could set a dangerous precedent and has already sparked fears of a possible kidnapping spree . “ if we get the same situation as we have in colombia where you see a whole industry of ransoming and hostage-taking , it would be very disconcerting , ” peter van ham , a dutch security expert , told reuters . among those sought after is one of the leading figures in the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , amari saifi , 47 , better known by his nom de guerre abderrazak el para .
he claimed his group was responsible for the kidnapping in a statement faxed to journalists in algiers . the gspc , which is reputed to have several hundred members , is fighting for a purist islamic state in algeria and has been linked to the al qaeda terrorist network . in order to identify other figures involved in the abduction , german authorities began questioning the released hostages as they left the malian capital bamako on their way to freedom .
according to spiegel , authorities are also in possession of a videotape on which several additional kidnappers appear . germans at risk berlin is also anxious to dissuade other groups that kidnapping is a lucrative activity because tourism officials say germans could be especially at risk .

schleyer was shot by his abductors after the government refused their demands to free imprisoned raf members . but the german stance shows signs of softening .

on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .
the investors claimed they were misled into approving the deal . although it is among the largest settlements in a shareholder class action , daimlerchrysler in the end decided $ 300 million -lrb- € 275 million -rrb- was a more attractive sum then $ 22 billion -lrb- € 20 billion -rrb- , the amount disgruntled investors were seeking in the suit that claimed the world ’ s fifth largest automaker had duped them into approving the merger of germany ’ s daimler-benz and chrysler in the united states . “ although daimlerchrysler believes the class action is completely without merit , the company has agreed to a settlement , since a local jury could have reached a different conclusion , ” the company said in a statement . the suits were filed after jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler ’ s ceo , told the financial times that he had always meant to relegate chrysler to a division of the group .
the investors , prompted by a suit already filed by billionaire kirk kerkorian , sued themselves , claiming the deal had been presented as a merger of equals , rather than a takeover , to keep the price down . kerkorian ’ s tracinda corp. once owned 14 percent of chrysler ’ s stock .
this settlement has no bearing on kerkorian ’ s suit , which daimlerchrysler has vowed to continue to fight . the final settlement is still subject to final agreement and to court approval .
the carmaker said $ 220 million of the settlement would be covered by insurers . “ that was very cheap for daimlerchrysler .
if the small shareholders get so little , kerkorian should get nothing because he was an insider , ” rolf woller , an analyst with hvb , told reuters . still , kerkorian ’ s lawyer , terry christensen , said the settlement was a positive development and said he is seeking compensatory damages for his client in the range of $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion . “ you don ’ t pay $ 300 million because it ’ s a nuisance , ” he said .

after the release of the 14 european tourists held for months by islamic extremists in the sahara desert , german authorities intend to search for the kidnappers with help from algerian and u.s. authorities . germany ’ s federal public prosecutors ’ office is preparing to issue warrants for the arrest of the hostage takers who kidnapped european adventure holidaymakers and held them for six months .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , although the kidnappers eventually released all but one hostage unharmed , berlin wants to counter the impression that it pays to kidnap germans . although terms of the hostages ’ release have not been made public , germany ’ s public broadcasters ard and zdf have reported that a 4.6 million euro -lrb- $ 5.06 million -rrb- ransom was paid to the kidnappers by germany via the malian government . “ the kidnappers should not escape unpunished , ” said chancellor gerhard schröder .
but neither he nor his government will comment on the ransom issue .
earlier , the chancellor said that he had “ good reason ” not to comment on those reports . crime does pay ? security analysts have said politicians have good reason to avoid the topic of paying ransom .
paying ransom for the release of hostages could set a dangerous precedent and has already sparked fears of a possible kidnapping spree . “ if we get the same situation as we have in colombia where you see a whole industry of ransoming and hostage-taking , it would be very disconcerting , ” peter van ham , a dutch security expert , told reuters . among those sought after is one of the leading figures in the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , amari saifi , 47 , better known by his nom de guerre abderrazak el para .
he claimed his group was responsible for the kidnapping in a statement faxed to journalists in algiers . the gspc , which is reputed to have several hundred members , is fighting for a purist islamic state in algeria and has been linked to the al qaeda terrorist network . in order to identify other figures involved in the abduction , german authorities began questioning the released hostages as they left the malian capital bamako on their way to freedom .
according to spiegel , authorities are also in possession of a videotape on which several additional kidnappers appear . germans at risk berlin is also anxious to dissuade other groups that kidnapping is a lucrative activity because tourism officials say germans could be especially at risk .
they are the world ’ s most frequent travellers and increasingly seek out remote destinations .
nine of the hostages were german , four were swiss and one dutch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally , the west german government has taken a hard line against kidnappers ’ demands .
that led in some cases to hostages being killed , such as hans-martin schleyer -lrb- picture -rrb- , the industrial leader kidnapped in 1977 by red army faction guerrillas .
schleyer was shot by his abductors after the government refused their demands to free imprisoned raf members . but the german stance shows signs of softening .
newspapers have reported that the german government paid nearly one million dollars in ransom in 2000 for a german woman who was being held in the southern philippines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians demand hostages pay up the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release .
sahara hostage negotiators racing against time four of the 14 remaining european tourists held by islamic rebels in northern africa are seriously ill .
renewed efforts to free the group are being taken by malian and german officials in the northern african country .

after the release of the 14 european tourists held for months by islamic extremists in the sahara desert , german authorities intend to search for the kidnappers with help from algerian and u.s. authorities . germany ’ s federal public prosecutors ’ office is preparing to issue warrants for the arrest of the hostage takers who kidnapped european adventure holidaymakers and held them for six months .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , although the kidnappers eventually released all but one hostage unharmed , berlin wants to counter the impression that it pays to kidnap germans . although terms of the hostages ’ release have not been made public , germany ’ s public broadcasters ard and zdf have reported that a 4.6 million euro -lrb- $ 5.06 million -rrb- ransom was paid to the kidnappers by germany via the malian government . “ the kidnappers should not escape unpunished , ” said chancellor gerhard schröder .
but neither he nor his government will comment on the ransom issue .
earlier , the chancellor said that he had “ good reason ” not to comment on those reports . crime does pay ? security analysts have said politicians have good reason to avoid the topic of paying ransom .
paying ransom for the release of hostages could set a dangerous precedent and has already sparked fears of a possible kidnapping spree . “ if we get the same situation as we have in colombia where you see a whole industry of ransoming and hostage-taking , it would be very disconcerting , ” peter van ham , a dutch security expert , told reuters . among those sought after is one of the leading figures in the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , amari saifi , 47 , better known by his nom de guerre abderrazak el para .
he claimed his group was responsible for the kidnapping in a statement faxed to journalists in algiers . the gspc , which is reputed to have several hundred members , is fighting for a purist islamic state in algeria and has been linked to the al qaeda terrorist network . in order to identify other figures involved in the abduction , german authorities began questioning the released hostages as they left the malian capital bamako on their way to freedom .
according to spiegel , authorities are also in possession of a videotape on which several additional kidnappers appear . germans at risk berlin is also anxious to dissuade other groups that kidnapping is a lucrative activity because tourism officials say germans could be especially at risk .
they are the world ’ s most frequent travellers and increasingly seek out remote destinations .
nine of the hostages were german , four were swiss and one dutch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally , the west german government has taken a hard line against kidnappers ’ demands .
that led in some cases to hostages being killed , such as hans-martin schleyer -lrb- picture -rrb- , the industrial leader kidnapped in 1977 by red army faction guerrillas .
schleyer was shot by his abductors after the government refused their demands to free imprisoned raf members . but the german stance shows signs of softening .

after the release of the 14 european tourists held for months by islamic extremists in the sahara desert , german authorities intend to search for the kidnappers with help from algerian and u.s. authorities . germany ’ s federal public prosecutors ’ office is preparing to issue warrants for the arrest of the hostage takers who kidnapped european adventure holidaymakers and held them for six months .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , although the kidnappers eventually released all but one hostage unharmed , berlin wants to counter the impression that it pays to kidnap germans . although terms of the hostages ’ release have not been made public , germany ’ s public broadcasters ard and zdf have reported that a 4.6 million euro -lrb- $ 5.06 million -rrb- ransom was paid to the kidnappers by germany via the malian government . “ the kidnappers should not escape unpunished , ” said chancellor gerhard schröder .
but neither he nor his government will comment on the ransom issue .
earlier , the chancellor said that he had “ good reason ” not to comment on those reports . crime does pay ? security analysts have said politicians have good reason to avoid the topic of paying ransom .
paying ransom for the release of hostages could set a dangerous precedent and has already sparked fears of a possible kidnapping spree . “ if we get the same situation as we have in colombia where you see a whole industry of ransoming and hostage-taking , it would be very disconcerting , ” peter van ham , a dutch security expert , told reuters . among those sought after is one of the leading figures in the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , amari saifi , 47 , better known by his nom de guerre abderrazak el para .
he claimed his group was responsible for the kidnapping in a statement faxed to journalists in algiers . the gspc , which is reputed to have several hundred members , is fighting for a purist islamic state in algeria and has been linked to the al qaeda terrorist network . in order to identify other figures involved in the abduction , german authorities began questioning the released hostages as they left the malian capital bamako on their way to freedom .
according to spiegel , authorities are also in possession of a videotape on which several additional kidnappers appear . germans at risk berlin is also anxious to dissuade other groups that kidnapping is a lucrative activity because tourism officials say germans could be especially at risk .
they are the world ’ s most frequent travellers and increasingly seek out remote destinations .
nine of the hostages were german , four were swiss and one dutch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally , the west german government has taken a hard line against kidnappers ’ demands .
that led in some cases to hostages being killed , such as hans-martin schleyer -lrb- picture -rrb- , the industrial leader kidnapped in 1977 by red army faction guerrillas .
schleyer was shot by his abductors after the government refused their demands to free imprisoned raf members . but the german stance shows signs of softening .
newspapers have reported that the german government paid nearly one million dollars in ransom in 2000 for a german woman who was being held in the southern philippines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians demand hostages pay up the 14 european hostages held for nearly six months in the sahara have arrived home , but it 's not just open arms greeting them .
german politicians are saying the hostages should pay part of the costs for their release .
sahara hostage negotiators racing against time four of the 14 remaining european tourists held by islamic rebels in northern africa are seriously ill .
renewed efforts to free the group are being taken by malian and german officials in the northern african country .

on friday , daimlerchrysler agreed to pay $ 300 million to disgruntled former chrysler investors to settle a lawsuit linked to the 1998 merger .
the investors claimed they were misled into approving the deal . although it is among the largest settlements in a shareholder class action , daimlerchrysler in the end decided $ 300 million -lrb- € 275 million -rrb- was a more attractive sum then $ 22 billion -lrb- € 20 billion -rrb- , the amount disgruntled investors were seeking in the suit that claimed the world ’ s fifth largest automaker had duped them into approving the merger of germany ’ s daimler-benz and chrysler in the united states . “ although daimlerchrysler believes the class action is completely without merit , the company has agreed to a settlement , since a local jury could have reached a different conclusion , ” the company said in a statement . the suits were filed after jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler ’ s ceo , told the financial times that he had always meant to relegate chrysler to a division of the group .
the investors , prompted by a suit already filed by billionaire kirk kerkorian , sued themselves , claiming the deal had been presented as a merger of equals , rather than a takeover , to keep the price down . kerkorian ’ s tracinda corp. once owned 14 percent of chrysler ’ s stock .
this settlement has no bearing on kerkorian ’ s suit , which daimlerchrysler has vowed to continue to fight . the final settlement is still subject to final agreement and to court approval .
the carmaker said $ 220 million of the settlement would be covered by insurers . “ that was very cheap for daimlerchrysler .
if the small shareholders get so little , kerkorian should get nothing because he was an insider , ” rolf woller , an analyst with hvb , told reuters . still , kerkorian ’ s lawyer , terry christensen , said the settlement was a positive development and said he is seeking compensatory damages for his client in the range of $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion . “ you don ’ t pay $ 300 million because it ’ s a nuisance , ” he said .

president george bush said the action was a response to tuesday 's suicide bombing by a palestinian militant that killed 20 people on a jerusalem bus .
the us administration is taking similar action against five groups alleged to have provided support for hamas .
the announcement came as thousands of palestinians turned out in gaza for the funeral of a hamas leader , ismail abu shanab , killed in an israeli air strike on thursday .
escalating violence palestinian authority officials warned on friday that they could do little to curb militant activities as long as israel continued its raids .
israel has stepped up raids in west bank towns " the palestinian leadership reiterates it is prepared to impose law and order ... and punish all -lrb- law -rrb- violators , but this ca n't be achieved while israel pursues its war against the palestinian authority , " said cabinet minister yasser abed rabbo .
he was speaking after a cabinet meeting in ramallah attended by palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli troops in the west bank city of nablus on friday shot dead three palestinian militants sheltering in a hospital , witnesses said .
the palestinian authority urged the united states to send monitors to help get the peace plan , known as the roadmap , back on track .
palestinian militants declared their seven-week-old truce to be over after the killing of abu shanab .
announcing the asset freeze , mr bush said that by claiming responsibility for the jerusalem bus bombing , hamas had " reaffirmed that it is a terrorist organisation committed to violence against israelis and to undermining progress towards peace " .
hamas ' leaders and those who provide their funding again have the blood of innocents on their hands john snow us treasury secretary " i call upon all nations supportive of peace in the middle east to recognise hamas as a terrorist organisation and to take all appropriate actions to deny it support . "
in addition to sheikh yassin , the us treasury department listed the hamas members affected as : imad khalil al-alami , usama hamdan , khalid mishaal , musa abu marzouk and abdel aziz rantisi .
the charities named are : comite de bienfaisance et de secours aux palestiniens -lrb- cbsp -rrb- of france the association de secours palestinien -lrb- asp -rrb- , of switzerland .
the palestinian relief and development fund , or interpal , based in britain .
the palestinian association in austria .
the sanabil association for relief and development , based in lebanon .
" hamas ' leaders and those who provide their funding again have the blood of innocents on their hands , " us treasury secretary john snow said .
" empty words can not wash them clean .
as they resist the road map for peace , hamas is devastating the dreams of the palestinian people for freedom , prosperity , and an independent state . "
previous clampdown the bush administration took similar action in december 2001 when it froze the assets of a us-based charity and two other groups accused of financing hamas .
the charity - the holy land foundation for relief and development - was at the time one of the largest muslim organisations in the us .
but according to an administration official , it is the first time the bush administration has taken action against organisations believed to be connected to hamas in europe .
similar action has been taken worldwide against al-qaeda and other terror networks , however .
the administration official said several european countries supported the asset freeze , but that washington was waiting to see the official response .

the announcement came as thousands of palestinians turned out in gaza for the funeral of a hamas leader , ismail abu shanab , killed in an israeli air strike on thursday .
escalating violence palestinian authority officials warned on friday that they could do little to curb militant activities as long as israel continued its raids .
israel has stepped up raids in west bank towns " the palestinian leadership reiterates it is prepared to impose law and order ... and punish all -lrb- law -rrb- violators , but this ca n't be achieved while israel pursues its war against the palestinian authority , " said cabinet minister yasser abed rabbo .
he was speaking after a cabinet meeting in ramallah attended by palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli troops in the west bank city of nablus on friday shot dead three palestinian militants sheltering in a hospital , witnesses said .
the palestinian authority urged the united states to send monitors to help get the peace plan , known as the roadmap , back on track .
palestinian militants declared their seven-week-old truce to be over after the killing of abu shanab .
announcing the asset freeze , mr bush said that by claiming responsibility for the jerusalem bus bombing , hamas had " reaffirmed that it is a terrorist organisation committed to violence against israelis and to undermining progress towards peace " .
hamas ' leaders and those who provide their funding again have the blood of innocents on their hands john snow us treasury secretary " i call upon all nations supportive of peace in the middle east to recognise hamas as a terrorist organisation and to take all appropriate actions to deny it support . "
in addition to sheikh yassin , the us treasury department listed the hamas members affected as : imad khalil al-alami , usama hamdan , khalid mishaal , musa abu marzouk and abdel aziz rantisi .
the charities named are : comite de bienfaisance et de secours aux palestiniens -lrb- cbsp -rrb- of france the association de secours palestinien -lrb- asp -rrb- , of switzerland .
the palestinian relief and development fund , or interpal , based in britain .
the palestinian association in austria .
the sanabil association for relief and development , based in lebanon .
" hamas ' leaders and those who provide their funding again have the blood of innocents on their hands , " us treasury secretary john snow said .
" empty words can not wash them clean .
as they resist the road map for peace , hamas is devastating the dreams of the palestinian people for freedom , prosperity , and an independent state . "
previous clampdown the bush administration took similar action in december 2001 when it froze the assets of a us-based charity and two other groups accused of financing hamas .
the charity - the holy land foundation for relief and development - was at the time one of the largest muslim organisations in the us .
but according to an administration official , it is the first time the bush administration has taken action against organisations believed to be connected to hamas in europe .
similar action has been taken worldwide against al-qaeda and other terror networks , however .
the administration official said several european countries supported the asset freeze , but that washington was waiting to see the official response .

sometime soon - no one knows exactly when - the now-empty building will become the focus of world attention as it hosts the first military tribunals for guantanamo 's detainees .
the pentagon says no official decision has been made on location or timing .
but the newly painted signs on the inside saying " courtroom " , " prosecution " and " defense " tell a different story .
six inmates at camp delta - two of them british - will be put on trial here , even though they have not yet had access to a lawyer .
as well as the detainees , american justice will also be on trial and the base is already preparing for the global media invasion that will come with the first hearings .
there have been reports that an execution chamber is being built .
the man in charge of the detainees , general geoffrey miller , said nothing was finalised yet .
" guantanamo has no approved plans for an execution chamber .
and so while we have plans , none have been approved , " he told the bbc .
child prisoners some people - deemed innocent after extensive interrogation - have been released from the camp .
some may stand trial soon .
others could just be left here to wait .
general miller explained how the fate of each man was decided .
" the commander 's responsibility is to make an assessment of when we have gained the valuable intelligence that the detainee has and then make an assessment of the threat the detainee poses , " he said .
" should they be transferred back to their own country , released or further detained ? "
down the road from the main prison camp sits camp iguana .
this is where the three child prisoners - aged between 13 and 15 - are held .
the children get very different treatment from the adults - games , recreation activities and even videos .
they also get a view of the ocean - something which they had never seen before , since they came from landlocked afghanistan .
the children - or juvenile enemy combatants as the pentagon prefers to call them - have also been seen by psychiatrists and social workers and received an intense education programme to try to aid their rehabilitation .
extensive interviews have led the us to believe they were kidnapped and coerced into fighting in afghanistan .
and so now it looks like the children may be released .
" we are very close to making a recommendation of a transfer back to their home countries , " general miller said .
food ' incentive ' the man in charge of the children , staff sergeant doug fitzpatrick , explained the children had not been subject to political education .
" we are in no way trying to americanise the juveniles here , " he told the bbc .
" what we are trying to do instead is just allow them to go back to the age they are .
the changes that have occurred in them are basically just reverting back to childhood . "
but for the nearly 700 adults at the main camp , there is no sign yet of what the future holds for most of them .
it is the lack of certainty that makes this so different to any other prison , where an inmate can look forward to a release or a parole date .
and this has taken its toll on the detainees .
psychiatrists are permanently on-site and there have been some 31 suicide attempts , including two in the past two weeks .
there is now a more gradated regime for the prisoners .
if they are well behaved and co-operate with interrogations , they are taken to a lower security part of the camp where they get more free time and more interaction with other prisoners .
these prisoners mill around in white uniforms to distinguish them from those in orange - the prisoners from the maximum security section , who spend almost all of their time locked up .
and the potential of a future release is also held before them to encourage a full confession .
food is also used as an incentive .
chief warrant officer james kluck is in charge of food for the detainees .
he explained how sweets were used , and how interrogators had even been to the mcdonalds on the main naval base and brought back happy meals to take to prisoners to try to get them to talk .
it is impossible to know just how much useful intelligence has been gleaned from the captives .
most seem too low-level to talk about anything like terrorist plots , and any information they had is now likely to be extremely dated .
but this still leaves the problem of what to do with them .
as soon as the diplomatic haggling is over , the military tribunals are likely to start up for a select few detainees .
and some others who , like the children , are considered innocent and no longer a threat may be released .
but for the hundreds of others of legal castaways here on this remote beautiful corner of cuba , the long wait to find out their fate will go on .

sometime soon - no one knows exactly when - the now-empty building will become the focus of world attention as it hosts the first military tribunals for guantanamo 's detainees .
the pentagon says no official decision has been made on location or timing .
but the newly painted signs on the inside saying " courtroom " , " prosecution " and " defense " tell a different story .
military tribunals may be held in this building six inmates at camp delta - two of them british - will be put on trial here , even though they have not yet had access to a lawyer .
as well as the detainees , american justice will also be on trial and the base is already preparing for the global media invasion that will come with the first hearings .
there have been reports that an execution chamber is being built .
the man in charge of the detainees , general geoffrey miller , said nothing was finalised yet .
" guantanamo has no approved plans for an execution chamber .
and so while we have plans , none have been approved , " he told the bbc .
child prisoners some people - deemed innocent after extensive interrogation - have been released from the camp .
some may stand trial soon .
others could just be left here to wait .
general miller explained how the fate of each man was decided .
there is no sign of what the future holds for most prisoners " the commander 's responsibility is to make an assessment of when we have gained the valuable intelligence that the detainee has and then make an assessment of the threat the detainee poses , " he said .
" should they be transferred back to their own country , released or further detained ? "
down the road from the main prison camp sits camp iguana .
this is where the three child prisoners - aged between 13 and 15 - are held .
the children get very different treatment from the adults - games , recreation activities and even videos .
they also get a view of the ocean - something which they had never seen before , since they came from landlocked afghanistan .
the children - or juvenile enemy combatants as the pentagon prefers to call them - have also been seen by psychiatrists and social workers and received an intense education programme to try to aid their rehabilitation .
extensive interviews have led the us to believe they were kidnapped and coerced into fighting in afghanistan .
and so now it looks like the children may be released .
" we are very close to making a recommendation of a transfer back to their home countries , " general miller said .
food ' incentive ' the man in charge of the children , staff sergeant doug fitzpatrick , explained the children had not been subject to political education .
prisoners at camp iguana have a tantalising view " we are in no way trying to americanise the juveniles here , " he told the bbc .
" what we are trying to do instead is just allow them to go back to the age they are .
the changes that have occurred in them are basically just reverting back to childhood . "
but for the nearly 700 adults at the main camp , there is no sign yet of what the future holds for most of them .
it is the lack of certainty that makes this so different to any other prison , where an inmate can look forward to a release or a parole date .
and this has taken its toll on the detainees .
psychiatrists are permanently on-site and there have been some 31 suicide attempts , including two in the past two weeks .
there is now a more gradated regime for the prisoners .
if they are well behaved and co-operate with interrogations , they are taken to a lower security part of the camp where they get more free time and more interaction with other prisoners .
these prisoners mill around in white uniforms to distinguish them from those in orange - the prisoners from the maximum security section , who spend almost all of their time locked up .
and the potential of a future release is also held before them to encourage a full confession .
food is also used as an incentive .
chief warrant officer james kluck is in charge of food for the detainees .
he explained how sweets were used , and how interrogators had even been to the mcdonalds on the main naval base and brought back happy meals to take to prisoners to try to get them to talk .
it is impossible to know just how much useful intelligence has been gleaned from the captives .
most seem too low-level to talk about anything like terrorist plots , and any information they had is now likely to be extremely dated .
but this still leaves the problem of what to do with them .
as soon as the diplomatic haggling is over , the military tribunals are likely to start up for a select few detainees .
and some others who , like the children , are considered innocent and no longer a threat may be released .
but for the hundreds of others of legal castaways here on this remote beautiful corner of cuba , the long wait to find out their fate will go on .

vintners in italy are rushing to pick their grapes before they dry up in the heat .
but experts say the sunny weather looks like good news for growers and wine-drinkers alike .
the heat has killed off parasites and thickened the grapes ' skins - which raises the alcohol and sugar content of the wine and produces its aromas .

even though grapes are producing less juice for pressing , the taste is more intense than usual , experts say .
depending on the final crop , italian wines to watch are chianti , barolo and brunello di montalcino , says luigi mainetti , an official at coldiretti , an italian farmers ' association .
one italian wine-maker , alfonso iannielli , from avio in the north-east , says he has already started gathering his chardonnay and pinot grapes .

it is still early days for many wine varieties though - heavy-bodied reds in particular .

vintners in italy are rushing to pick their grapes before they dry up in the heat .
but experts say the sunny weather looks like good news for growers and wine-drinkers alike .
the heat has killed off parasites and thickened the grapes ' skins - which raises the alcohol and sugar content of the wine and produces its aromas .

even though grapes are producing less juice for pressing , the taste is more intense than usual , experts say .
depending on the final crop , italian wines to watch are chianti , barolo and brunello di montalcino , says luigi mainetti , an official at coldiretti , an italian farmers ' association .
one italian wine-maker , alfonso iannielli , from avio in the north-east , says he has already started gathering his chardonnay and pinot grapes .
" normally in this period we close down and go on holiday , but we 've had to give that up , " he told associated press news agency .
" still there are some good sides to it .
" for instance , right now the children are not in school and they can take part in the harvest .
" this way it can be done all in the family , like it used to be . "
it is still early days for many wine varieties though - heavy-bodied reds in particular .
" for the other grapes we are in the hands of god , " says pino giaccone , a wine-maker in the sicilian town of donnafugata .
" we need just a little rain , not a lot , no calamities , just a little rain . "

the 10-metre mast will be situated near a hospital and a school in wonford .
residents say exeter city council failed to tell them about the planning application from hutchison 3g for the mast .

" but i did n't know that planning approval had already been given at that stage . "
amy mckain camped out for two weeks to buy her ministry of defence home just 20 metres from where the mast will be placed .
" the day after we signed contracts , i read in the local paper they were putting up a mast literally on my doorstep , " she said .
" it is quite a shock when you have been through the buying procedure . "
hutchison 3g said that where there was local opposition to the siting of one of its masts , it tried to work with the community to find an alternative location .
international guidelines but , on this occasion , it was not able to find one .
many people are worried about the health implications of phone masts , but phone companies say they operate well within national and international guidelines .
local councils are reluctant to turn down applications on health grounds , because if they do , the decision is generally overturned at an appeal .
residents in exeter hope their concerns will be raised at a public meeting .

the 10-metre mast will be situated near a hospital and a school in wonford .
residents say exeter city council failed to tell them about the planning application from hutchison 3g for the mast .
but the council insists local residents were kept fully informed of developments .
one resident , samantha hillier , said : " i think it was in january this year that , through word of mouth from a neighbour , we heard an application had been made .
" but i did n't know that planning approval had already been given at that stage . "
samantha hillier heard of plans from a neighbour amy mckain camped out for two weeks to buy her ministry of defence home just 20 metres from where the mast will be placed .
" the day after we signed contracts , i read in the local paper they were putting up a mast literally on my doorstep , " she said .
" it is quite a shock when you have been through the buying procedure . "
hutchison 3g said that where there was local opposition to the siting of one of its masts , it tried to work with the community to find an alternative location .
international guidelines but , on this occasion , it was not able to find one .
many people are worried about the health implications of phone masts , but phone companies say they operate well within national and international guidelines .
local councils are reluctant to turn down applications on health grounds , because if they do , the decision is generally overturned at an appeal .
residents in exeter hope their concerns will be raised at a public meeting .

mr newbold , from bridgend , will be making a 200-mile trek from north to south wales with the aim of urging other men to carry out a potentially lifesaving act .
the 35-year-old 's message to men is simple : " check your tackle " .
twice hit by testicular cancer himself , mr newbold has joined cancer charity tenovus in its fight to make men more aware of the need for regular self-examination .
he began his walk at 0900 bst at the clock tower on rhyl promenade , and is expected to finish at cardiff castle on friday .
the sponsored walk aims to also raise £ 100,000 for tenovus patient care programmes and the charity 's freephone cancer helpline .
mark 's marathon march mark is power-walking 200,000 miles - that is 50p for every step each day he will cover the distance of the london marathon during his 200-mile ordeal he will expend 15,200 calories along the way , he will be supported by a back-up vehicle , driven by his father .
police forces have also designated officers to help him on his way , and hoteliers and guest house owners have provided free accommodation .
last year a tongue-in-cheek campaign by bbc wales - fronted by stereophonics drummer stuart cable - raised awareness about testicular cancer and won an award for its ingenuity .
in a tv and poster campaign , cable urged young men to look out for abnormal lumps in an attention-grabbing initiative which aimed to strip away the stigma surrounding the disease .
earlier this year , research revealed that the survival chances of young men with an aggressive form of testicular cancer could be dramatically improved by intensive chemotherapy .
the majority of young men with testicular cancer can expect to be cured .
but for a minority with a particularly aggressive form of the disease , the chances of survival are only 50:50 .
testicular cancer facts there are 1,600 cases a year 18 to 35-year-olds are most at risk 95 % survive if detected early however , scientists at the institute of cancer research and the royal marsden hospital have boosted the survival rate to 88 % by the intensive use of drug treatments .
in total , 54 patients were given the new form of accelerated chemotherapy treatment for four weeks , followed by more standard drug therapy .
five years after the treatment 83 % had showed no sign of the disease returning , remained recurrence-free and 88 % were alive .
researcher dr robert huddart said : " this type of tumour cell is known to divide and proliferate rapidly during the early stages of treatment and our intensive dosing early on may help to overcome this .
testicular cancer responds well to treatment " these results are the best yet to be achieved internationally for patients suffering from aggressive testicular cancer . "
the next stage will be to test the new-style treatment against standard therapy .
professor peter rigby , chief executive of the institute of cancer research , said : " some 96 % of testicular cancers are curable when caught early enough and the results of this trial suggest that a great step forward has now been made in treating a particularly aggressive form of the disease .
" a further advantage of this treatment is that it uses existing drugs in a different way , so it is easily available . "
testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer in young men , mostly affecting those between the ages of 20 and 35 .
there are now 1,600 cases a year , an increase of 70 % in the last 20 years .
professor robert souhami , director of clinical research at cancer research uk , said : " testicular cancer responds amazingly well to chemotherapy and more than nine out of ten cases are successfully treated .
" but there is a small percentage of aggressive testicular cancers that do not respond well to conventional chemotherapy .
" it is vital that we focus on ways to improve treatment for patients with these tumours and the results from this trial look very promising . "
