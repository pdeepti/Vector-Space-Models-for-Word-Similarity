heads of the world 's eight leading industrialized nations meet on june 1 in the french spa town of evian for the annual g8 summit with an ambitious agenda and hopes of transatlantic reconciliation . leaders of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit will be heading to the idyllic alpine lakeside resort of evian on june 1 for a grueling three days of talks on topics ranging from the global economy to fighting famine in africa . coming in from st. petersburg , where celebrations will be held to mark the 300th anniversary of the russian city , heads of the united states , canada , japan , germany , france , great britain , italy and russia will be meeting for the first time since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
there are already signs the recently strained transatlantic relationship is likely to dominate talks . vive la france ! : bush extends conciliatory handshake u.s. president george w. bush has plans for a one-on-one meeting with french president jacques chirac , who led a vigorous campaign against the iraq invasion in the united nations security council .
bush said he hoped the meeting would help ease some of the tension between the two countries . " evian will not be a summit of confrontation .
on this trip i am determined to work with france and french leaders , " bush told the french daily le figaro .
" i expect to have a good discussion with jacques chirac , " the president said , adding in french : " vive la france " -lrb- long live france -rrb- . bush indicated he was willing to put behind washington 's anger at the french stance on the war in iraq . " there is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the american people toward the french decision , that 's realistic , " he said .
" i 've got to convince the skeptics in france that the intentions of the united states are positive .
and the french leadership has got work to do to convince the american people that they are concerned about the security of our country .

powell will also meet with his german counterpart joschka fischer to discuss the german-u.s. relations .
-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- the u.s. president also had warm words for war opponent russia , saying his country would support moscow 's entry into the world trade organization .
the president did not extend an olive branch to chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , whom he has largely snubbed since schröder turned germany 's opposition to the war into a campaign issue . divisive issues expected at summit the summit is expected to address a host of other contentious issues facing the world and currently dividing various group members . analysts say the differences among the eight need to be laid aside . " this is their first meeting since the war in iraq , " said fred bergsten , director of the washington think-tank institute for international economics in a reuters interview . " evian is a critical moment in restoring the multilateral process . " professor john kirton , head of the university of toronto 's g8 research group wrote in remarks due to be presented at a seminar on the g8 outside paris on tuesday , " seldom before has a g8 so divided confronted an agenda and opportunity so large . " while the bush camp wants the summit to focus on the war against terrorism , the middle east peace process and on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology , france hopes to steer talks towards alleviating problems of the third world . chirac pushes pro-third world agenda " we need intensive dialogue with developing countries , " the french president said last week .
following what has become almost a tradition at the g8 summit , chirac has invited leaders of five african countries , initiators of the " new partnership for africa 's development " .
in addition , the french president has for the first time invited leaders from china , brazil , mexico , india , saudi-arabia , malaysia and morocco to for a special opening session on global issues on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nurse from medecins sans frontieres lifts tomasinho , 2 , who is suffering from malnutrition , at the hospital in kuito , some 500 miles -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- southeast of luanda , angola , wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the hospital attends to approximately 5,000 people , of which the majority are young children .
medecins sans frontieres , also known as doctors without borders , warned tuesday that malnutrition in angola was the worst its staff had seen since a devastating 1998 famine in sudan .
-lrb- ap photo / marcelo hernandez -rrb- chirac is keen the summit addresses third world issues such as fighting huger and famine and a g8 action plan on africa agreed last year that includes unfufilled measures such as creating an african peacekeeping force .
chirac 's initiative is backed by u.n. secretary-general kofi annan who in a letter to the g8 has pressed for progress on dismantling trade barriers and better access to drugs to fight aids and other diseases in poor countries . " i hope your meeting will discuss , not whether we need to address these challenges , but how we can resolve them , " annan wrote . bush will bring his own , specific suggestions for france and the rest of europe on how to tackle a difficult third-world agenda .
the president wants the european union to reconsider its ban on the import of genetically-modified food which he says can help africans fight famine . he also called for europe to follow america 's lead in pledging billions to fight aids in africa and the carribean . g8 cooperation key to aiding world economy the slumping world economy , which has affected every one of the g8 members will remain a major topic .
the french president has urged world leaders to deliver a optimistic message to kick start the world economy at a time when many of europe 's economies are struggling and the dollar is in a tailspin . financial analysts have underscored the importance of the evian summit addressing the problem and said it could help restore business and investor confidence . " if these guys go to evian and can not show their ability to cooperate , it will be very damaging politically and economically and there would be severe damage in financial markets , " bergsten told reuters . bush has already said he would seek to reassure his g8 partners that washington was on track with its " strong dollar " policy , despite the dollar 's slide to historic lows against the euro in recent days .
" i am going to tell my partners that the united states is conducting a healthy monetary and fiscal policy , " bush told le figaro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 falls short on middle east , africa goals full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2003 evian braces for protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protesters are already making their points , even before world leaders arrive on sunday .
as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .
four " anti-capitalist " villages set up in the area will offer visitors alternatives to the g8 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator throws a molotov cocktail .
" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2003 evian braces for protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protesters are already making their points , even before world leaders arrive on sunday .
as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .

as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .
they expect us to say ‘ yes ’ to that what we haven ’ t seen and that is just not on , ” said christian social union general secretary thomas goppel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions rally thousands against schröder 's reform plans germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2003 evian braces for protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protesters are already making their points , even before world leaders arrive on sunday .
as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .
four " anti-capitalist " villages set up in the area will offer visitors alternatives to the g8 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator throws a molotov cocktail .
" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .
" all companies -lsb- in the geneva area -rsb- will experience a slowdown from thursday that will run until monday or tuesday , " patrick mayer a member of the chamber of commerce 's management committee , told swissinfo .
" that slowdown obviously carries a pretty tremendous cost . " the financial impact could be compounded by tight security that keeps employees from going to work and consumers from shopping .
furthermore , vacationers are steering clear of the area , leaving hotel bookings down by as much as 50 percent . already on thursday the majority of the shops in geneva 's city center had been boarded up , and many residents had left town on vacation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from athens to berlin , a day of protest and anger hundreds of thousands of europeans took to the streets thursday just hours after the u.s.-led attack on iraq began .

officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .

as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .

protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .

heads of the world 's eight leading industrialized nations meet on june 1 in the french spa town of evian for the annual g8 summit with an ambitious agenda and hopes of transatlantic reconciliation . leaders of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit will be heading to the idyllic alpine lakeside resort of evian on june 1 for a grueling three days of talks on topics ranging from the global economy to fighting famine in africa . coming in from st. petersburg , where celebrations will be held to mark the 300th anniversary of the russian city , heads of the united states , canada , japan , germany , france , great britain , italy and russia will be meeting for the first time since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
there are already signs the recently strained transatlantic relationship is likely to dominate talks . vive la france ! : bush extends conciliatory handshake u.s. president george w. bush has plans for a one-on-one meeting with french president jacques chirac , who led a vigorous campaign against the iraq invasion in the united nations security council .
bush said he hoped the meeting would help ease some of the tension between the two countries . " evian will not be a summit of confrontation .
on this trip i am determined to work with france and french leaders , " bush told the french daily le figaro .
" i expect to have a good discussion with jacques chirac , " the president said , adding in french : " vive la france " -lrb- long live france -rrb- . bush indicated he was willing to put behind washington 's anger at the french stance on the war in iraq . " there is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the american people toward the french decision , that 's realistic , " he said .
" i 've got to convince the skeptics in france that the intentions of the united states are positive .
and the french leadership has got work to do to convince the american people that they are concerned about the security of our country .

powell will also meet with his german counterpart joschka fischer to discuss the german-u.s. relations .
-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- the u.s. president also had warm words for war opponent russia , saying his country would support moscow 's entry into the world trade organization .
the president did not extend an olive branch to chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , whom he has largely snubbed since schröder turned germany 's opposition to the war into a campaign issue . divisive issues expected at summit the summit is expected to address a host of other contentious issues facing the world and currently dividing various group members . analysts say the differences among the eight need to be laid aside . " this is their first meeting since the war in iraq , " said fred bergsten , director of the washington think-tank institute for international economics in a reuters interview . " evian is a critical moment in restoring the multilateral process . " professor john kirton , head of the university of toronto 's g8 research group wrote in remarks due to be presented at a seminar on the g8 outside paris on tuesday , " seldom before has a g8 so divided confronted an agenda and opportunity so large . " while the bush camp wants the summit to focus on the war against terrorism , the middle east peace process and on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology , france hopes to steer talks towards alleviating problems of the third world . chirac pushes pro-third world agenda " we need intensive dialogue with developing countries , " the french president said last week .
following what has become almost a tradition at the g8 summit , chirac has invited leaders of five african countries , initiators of the " new partnership for africa 's development " .
in addition , the french president has for the first time invited leaders from china , brazil , mexico , india , saudi-arabia , malaysia and morocco to for a special opening session on global issues on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nurse from medecins sans frontieres lifts tomasinho , 2 , who is suffering from malnutrition , at the hospital in kuito , some 500 miles -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- southeast of luanda , angola , wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the hospital attends to approximately 5,000 people , of which the majority are young children .
medecins sans frontieres , also known as doctors without borders , warned tuesday that malnutrition in angola was the worst its staff had seen since a devastating 1998 famine in sudan .
-lrb- ap photo / marcelo hernandez -rrb- chirac is keen the summit addresses third world issues such as fighting huger and famine and a g8 action plan on africa agreed last year that includes unfufilled measures such as creating an african peacekeeping force .
chirac 's initiative is backed by u.n. secretary-general kofi annan who in a letter to the g8 has pressed for progress on dismantling trade barriers and better access to drugs to fight aids and other diseases in poor countries . " i hope your meeting will discuss , not whether we need to address these challenges , but how we can resolve them , " annan wrote . bush will bring his own , specific suggestions for france and the rest of europe on how to tackle a difficult third-world agenda .
the president wants the european union to reconsider its ban on the import of genetically-modified food which he says can help africans fight famine . he also called for europe to follow america 's lead in pledging billions to fight aids in africa and the carribean . g8 cooperation key to aiding world economy the slumping world economy , which has affected every one of the g8 members will remain a major topic .
the french president has urged world leaders to deliver a optimistic message to kick start the world economy at a time when many of europe 's economies are struggling and the dollar is in a tailspin . financial analysts have underscored the importance of the evian summit addressing the problem and said it could help restore business and investor confidence . " if these guys go to evian and can not show their ability to cooperate , it will be very damaging politically and economically and there would be severe damage in financial markets , " bergsten told reuters . bush has already said he would seek to reassure his g8 partners that washington was on track with its " strong dollar " policy , despite the dollar 's slide to historic lows against the euro in recent days .
" i am going to tell my partners that the united states is conducting a healthy monetary and fiscal policy , " bush told le figaro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 falls short on middle east , africa goals full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .

as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .
four " anti-capitalist " villages set up in the area will offer visitors alternatives to the g8 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator throws a molotov cocktail .
" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .

heads of the world 's eight leading industrialized nations meet on june 1 in the french spa town of evian for the annual g8 summit with an ambitious agenda and hopes of transatlantic reconciliation . leaders of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit will be heading to the idyllic alpine lakeside resort of evian on june 1 for a grueling three days of talks on topics ranging from the global economy to fighting famine in africa . coming in from st. petersburg , where celebrations will be held to mark the 300th anniversary of the russian city , heads of the united states , canada , japan , germany , france , great britain , italy and russia will be meeting for the first time since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
there are already signs the recently strained transatlantic relationship is likely to dominate talks . vive la france ! : bush extends conciliatory handshake u.s. president george w. bush has plans for a one-on-one meeting with french president jacques chirac , who led a vigorous campaign against the iraq invasion in the united nations security council .
bush said he hoped the meeting would help ease some of the tension between the two countries . " evian will not be a summit of confrontation .
on this trip i am determined to work with france and french leaders , " bush told the french daily le figaro .
" i expect to have a good discussion with jacques chirac , " the president said , adding in french : " vive la france " -lrb- long live france -rrb- . bush indicated he was willing to put behind washington 's anger at the french stance on the war in iraq . " there is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the american people toward the french decision , that 's realistic , " he said .
" i 've got to convince the skeptics in france that the intentions of the united states are positive .
and the french leadership has got work to do to convince the american people that they are concerned about the security of our country .

powell will also meet with his german counterpart joschka fischer to discuss the german-u.s. relations .
-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- the u.s. president also had warm words for war opponent russia , saying his country would support moscow 's entry into the world trade organization .
the president did not extend an olive branch to chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , whom he has largely snubbed since schröder turned germany 's opposition to the war into a campaign issue . divisive issues expected at summit the summit is expected to address a host of other contentious issues facing the world and currently dividing various group members . analysts say the differences among the eight need to be laid aside . " this is their first meeting since the war in iraq , " said fred bergsten , director of the washington think-tank institute for international economics in a reuters interview . " evian is a critical moment in restoring the multilateral process . " professor john kirton , head of the university of toronto 's g8 research group wrote in remarks due to be presented at a seminar on the g8 outside paris on tuesday , " seldom before has a g8 so divided confronted an agenda and opportunity so large . " while the bush camp wants the summit to focus on the war against terrorism , the middle east peace process and on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology , france hopes to steer talks towards alleviating problems of the third world . chirac pushes pro-third world agenda " we need intensive dialogue with developing countries , " the french president said last week .
following what has become almost a tradition at the g8 summit , chirac has invited leaders of five african countries , initiators of the " new partnership for africa 's development " .
in addition , the french president has for the first time invited leaders from china , brazil , mexico , india , saudi-arabia , malaysia and morocco to for a special opening session on global issues on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nurse from medecins sans frontieres lifts tomasinho , 2 , who is suffering from malnutrition , at the hospital in kuito , some 500 miles -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- southeast of luanda , angola , wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the hospital attends to approximately 5,000 people , of which the majority are young children .
medecins sans frontieres , also known as doctors without borders , warned tuesday that malnutrition in angola was the worst its staff had seen since a devastating 1998 famine in sudan .
-lrb- ap photo / marcelo hernandez -rrb- chirac is keen the summit addresses third world issues such as fighting huger and famine and a g8 action plan on africa agreed last year that includes unfufilled measures such as creating an african peacekeeping force .
chirac 's initiative is backed by u.n. secretary-general kofi annan who in a letter to the g8 has pressed for progress on dismantling trade barriers and better access to drugs to fight aids and other diseases in poor countries . " i hope your meeting will discuss , not whether we need to address these challenges , but how we can resolve them , " annan wrote . bush will bring his own , specific suggestions for france and the rest of europe on how to tackle a difficult third-world agenda .
the president wants the european union to reconsider its ban on the import of genetically-modified food which he says can help africans fight famine . he also called for europe to follow america 's lead in pledging billions to fight aids in africa and the carribean . g8 cooperation key to aiding world economy the slumping world economy , which has affected every one of the g8 members will remain a major topic .
the french president has urged world leaders to deliver a optimistic message to kick start the world economy at a time when many of europe 's economies are struggling and the dollar is in a tailspin . financial analysts have underscored the importance of the evian summit addressing the problem and said it could help restore business and investor confidence . " if these guys go to evian and can not show their ability to cooperate , it will be very damaging politically and economically and there would be severe damage in financial markets , " bergsten told reuters . bush has already said he would seek to reassure his g8 partners that washington was on track with its " strong dollar " policy , despite the dollar 's slide to historic lows against the euro in recent days .
" i am going to tell my partners that the united states is conducting a healthy monetary and fiscal policy , " bush told le figaro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 falls short on middle east , africa goals full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .

on this trip i am determined to work with france and french leaders , " bush told the french daily le figaro .
" i expect to have a good discussion with jacques chirac , " the president said , adding in french : " vive la france " -lrb- long live france -rrb- . bush indicated he was willing to put behind washington 's anger at the french stance on the war in iraq . " there is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the american people toward the french decision , that 's realistic , " he said .
" i 've got to convince the skeptics in france that the intentions of the united states are positive .
and the french leadership has got work to do to convince the american people that they are concerned about the security of our country .

-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- the u.s. president also had warm words for war opponent russia , saying his country would support moscow 's entry into the world trade organization .
the president did not extend an olive branch to chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , whom he has largely snubbed since schröder turned germany 's opposition to the war into a campaign issue . divisive issues expected at summit the summit is expected to address a host of other contentious issues facing the world and currently dividing various group members . analysts say the differences among the eight need to be laid aside . " this is their first meeting since the war in iraq , " said fred bergsten , director of the washington think-tank institute for international economics in a reuters interview . " evian is a critical moment in restoring the multilateral process . " professor john kirton , head of the university of toronto 's g8 research group wrote in remarks due to be presented at a seminar on the g8 outside paris on tuesday , " seldom before has a g8 so divided confronted an agenda and opportunity so large . " while the bush camp wants the summit to focus on the war against terrorism , the middle east peace process and on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology , france hopes to steer talks towards alleviating problems of the third world . chirac pushes pro-third world agenda " we need intensive dialogue with developing countries , " the french president said last week .
following what has become almost a tradition at the g8 summit , chirac has invited leaders of five african countries , initiators of the " new partnership for africa 's development " .
in addition , the french president has for the first time invited leaders from china , brazil , mexico , india , saudi-arabia , malaysia and morocco to for a special opening session on global issues on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nurse from medecins sans frontieres lifts tomasinho , 2 , who is suffering from malnutrition , at the hospital in kuito , some 500 miles -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- southeast of luanda , angola , wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .

chirac 's initiative is backed by u.n. secretary-general kofi annan who in a letter to the g8 has pressed for progress on dismantling trade barriers and better access to drugs to fight aids and other diseases in poor countries . " i hope your meeting will discuss , not whether we need to address these challenges , but how we can resolve them , " annan wrote . bush will bring his own , specific suggestions for france and the rest of europe on how to tackle a difficult third-world agenda .
the president wants the european union to reconsider its ban on the import of genetically-modified food which he says can help africans fight famine . he also called for europe to follow america 's lead in pledging billions to fight aids in africa and the carribean . g8 cooperation key to aiding world economy the slumping world economy , which has affected every one of the g8 members will remain a major topic .
the french president has urged world leaders to deliver a optimistic message to kick start the world economy at a time when many of europe 's economies are struggling and the dollar is in a tailspin . financial analysts have underscored the importance of the evian summit addressing the problem and said it could help restore business and investor confidence . " if these guys go to evian and can not show their ability to cooperate , it will be very damaging politically and economically and there would be severe damage in financial markets , " bergsten told reuters . bush has already said he would seek to reassure his g8 partners that washington was on track with its " strong dollar " policy , despite the dollar 's slide to historic lows against the euro in recent days .
" i am going to tell my partners that the united states is conducting a healthy monetary and fiscal policy , " bush told le figaro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 falls short on middle east , africa goals full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .

heads of the world 's eight leading industrialized nations meet on june 1 in the french spa town of evian for the annual g8 summit with an ambitious agenda and hopes of transatlantic reconciliation . leaders of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit will be heading to the idyllic alpine lakeside resort of evian on june 1 for a grueling three days of talks on topics ranging from the global economy to fighting famine in africa . coming in from st. petersburg , where celebrations will be held to mark the 300th anniversary of the russian city , heads of the united states , canada , japan , germany , france , great britain , italy and russia will be meeting for the first time since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
there are already signs the recently strained transatlantic relationship is likely to dominate talks . vive la france ! : bush extends conciliatory handshake u.s. president george w. bush has plans for a one-on-one meeting with french president jacques chirac , who led a vigorous campaign against the iraq invasion in the united nations security council .
bush said he hoped the meeting would help ease some of the tension between the two countries . " evian will not be a summit of confrontation .
on this trip i am determined to work with france and french leaders , " bush told the french daily le figaro .
" i expect to have a good discussion with jacques chirac , " the president said , adding in french : " vive la france " -lrb- long live france -rrb- . bush indicated he was willing to put behind washington 's anger at the french stance on the war in iraq . " there is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the american people toward the french decision , that 's realistic , " he said .
" i 've got to convince the skeptics in france that the intentions of the united states are positive .
and the french leadership has got work to do to convince the american people that they are concerned about the security of our country .

powell will also meet with his german counterpart joschka fischer to discuss the german-u.s. relations .
-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- the u.s. president also had warm words for war opponent russia , saying his country would support moscow 's entry into the world trade organization .
the president did not extend an olive branch to chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , whom he has largely snubbed since schröder turned germany 's opposition to the war into a campaign issue . divisive issues expected at summit the summit is expected to address a host of other contentious issues facing the world and currently dividing various group members . analysts say the differences among the eight need to be laid aside . " this is their first meeting since the war in iraq , " said fred bergsten , director of the washington think-tank institute for international economics in a reuters interview . " evian is a critical moment in restoring the multilateral process . " professor john kirton , head of the university of toronto 's g8 research group wrote in remarks due to be presented at a seminar on the g8 outside paris on tuesday , " seldom before has a g8 so divided confronted an agenda and opportunity so large . " while the bush camp wants the summit to focus on the war against terrorism , the middle east peace process and on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology , france hopes to steer talks towards alleviating problems of the third world . chirac pushes pro-third world agenda " we need intensive dialogue with developing countries , " the french president said last week .
following what has become almost a tradition at the g8 summit , chirac has invited leaders of five african countries , initiators of the " new partnership for africa 's development " .
in addition , the french president has for the first time invited leaders from china , brazil , mexico , india , saudi-arabia , malaysia and morocco to for a special opening session on global issues on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nurse from medecins sans frontieres lifts tomasinho , 2 , who is suffering from malnutrition , at the hospital in kuito , some 500 miles -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- southeast of luanda , angola , wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .

-lrb- ap photo / marcelo hernandez -rrb- chirac is keen the summit addresses third world issues such as fighting huger and famine and a g8 action plan on africa agreed last year that includes unfufilled measures such as creating an african peacekeeping force .
chirac 's initiative is backed by u.n. secretary-general kofi annan who in a letter to the g8 has pressed for progress on dismantling trade barriers and better access to drugs to fight aids and other diseases in poor countries . " i hope your meeting will discuss , not whether we need to address these challenges , but how we can resolve them , " annan wrote . bush will bring his own , specific suggestions for france and the rest of europe on how to tackle a difficult third-world agenda .
the president wants the european union to reconsider its ban on the import of genetically-modified food which he says can help africans fight famine . he also called for europe to follow america 's lead in pledging billions to fight aids in africa and the carribean . g8 cooperation key to aiding world economy the slumping world economy , which has affected every one of the g8 members will remain a major topic .
the french president has urged world leaders to deliver a optimistic message to kick start the world economy at a time when many of europe 's economies are struggling and the dollar is in a tailspin . financial analysts have underscored the importance of the evian summit addressing the problem and said it could help restore business and investor confidence .

as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .
four " anti-capitalist " villages set up in the area will offer visitors alternatives to the g8 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator throws a molotov cocktail .
" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .
" all companies -lsb- in the geneva area -rsb- will experience a slowdown from thursday that will run until monday or tuesday , " patrick mayer a member of the chamber of commerce 's management committee , told swissinfo .
" that slowdown obviously carries a pretty tremendous cost . " the financial impact could be compounded by tight security that keeps employees from going to work and consumers from shopping .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .
they expect us to say ‘ yes ’ to that what we haven ’ t seen and that is just not on , ” said christian social union general secretary thomas goppel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions rally thousands against schröder 's reform plans germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms .
-lrb- may 25 , 2003 -rrb- schröder urges reform as spd celebrates 140th anniversary as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day .

the president did not extend an olive branch to chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , whom he has largely snubbed since schröder turned germany 's opposition to the war into a campaign issue . divisive issues expected at summit the summit is expected to address a host of other contentious issues facing the world and currently dividing various group members . analysts say the differences among the eight need to be laid aside .

" i hope your meeting will discuss , not whether we need to address these challenges , but how we can resolve them , " annan wrote . bush will bring his own , specific suggestions for france and the rest of europe on how to tackle a difficult third-world agenda .

the french president has urged world leaders to deliver a optimistic message to kick start the world economy at a time when many of europe 's economies are struggling and the dollar is in a tailspin . financial analysts have underscored the importance of the evian summit addressing the problem and said it could help restore business and investor confidence . " if these guys go to evian and can not show their ability to cooperate , it will be very damaging politically and economically and there would be severe damage in financial markets , " bergsten told reuters . bush has already said he would seek to reassure his g8 partners that washington was on track with its " strong dollar " policy , despite the dollar 's slide to historic lows against the euro in recent days .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .
they expect us to say ‘ yes ’ to that what we haven ’ t seen and that is just not on , ” said christian social union general secretary thomas goppel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions rally thousands against schröder 's reform plans germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms .

as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .
four " anti-capitalist " villages set up in the area will offer visitors alternatives to the g8 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator throws a molotov cocktail .
" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .
" all companies -lsb- in the geneva area -rsb- will experience a slowdown from thursday that will run until monday or tuesday , " patrick mayer a member of the chamber of commerce 's management committee , told swissinfo .
" that slowdown obviously carries a pretty tremendous cost . " the financial impact could be compounded by tight security that keeps employees from going to work and consumers from shopping .
furthermore , vacationers are steering clear of the area , leaving hotel bookings down by as much as 50 percent . already on thursday the majority of the shops in geneva 's city center had been boarded up , and many residents had left town on vacation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from athens to berlin , a day of protest and anger hundreds of thousands of europeans took to the streets thursday just hours after the u.s.-led attack on iraq began .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .

his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .

the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .
they expect us to say ‘ yes ’ to that what we haven ’ t seen and that is just not on , ” said christian social union general secretary thomas goppel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions rally thousands against schröder 's reform plans germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms .

heads of the world 's eight leading industrialized nations meet on june 1 in the french spa town of evian for the annual g8 summit with an ambitious agenda and hopes of transatlantic reconciliation . leaders of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit will be heading to the idyllic alpine lakeside resort of evian on june 1 for a grueling three days of talks on topics ranging from the global economy to fighting famine in africa . coming in from st. petersburg , where celebrations will be held to mark the 300th anniversary of the russian city , heads of the united states , canada , japan , germany , france , great britain , italy and russia will be meeting for the first time since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
there are already signs the recently strained transatlantic relationship is likely to dominate talks . vive la france ! : bush extends conciliatory handshake u.s. president george w. bush has plans for a one-on-one meeting with french president jacques chirac , who led a vigorous campaign against the iraq invasion in the united nations security council .
bush said he hoped the meeting would help ease some of the tension between the two countries . " evian will not be a summit of confrontation .
on this trip i am determined to work with france and french leaders , " bush told the french daily le figaro .
" i expect to have a good discussion with jacques chirac , " the president said , adding in french : " vive la france " -lrb- long live france -rrb- . bush indicated he was willing to put behind washington 's anger at the french stance on the war in iraq . " there is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the american people toward the french decision , that 's realistic , " he said .
" i 've got to convince the skeptics in france that the intentions of the united states are positive .
and the french leadership has got work to do to convince the american people that they are concerned about the security of our country .

powell will also meet with his german counterpart joschka fischer to discuss the german-u.s. relations .
-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- the u.s. president also had warm words for war opponent russia , saying his country would support moscow 's entry into the world trade organization .
the president did not extend an olive branch to chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , whom he has largely snubbed since schröder turned germany 's opposition to the war into a campaign issue . divisive issues expected at summit the summit is expected to address a host of other contentious issues facing the world and currently dividing various group members . analysts say the differences among the eight need to be laid aside . " this is their first meeting since the war in iraq , " said fred bergsten , director of the washington think-tank institute for international economics in a reuters interview . " evian is a critical moment in restoring the multilateral process . " professor john kirton , head of the university of toronto 's g8 research group wrote in remarks due to be presented at a seminar on the g8 outside paris on tuesday , " seldom before has a g8 so divided confronted an agenda and opportunity so large . " while the bush camp wants the summit to focus on the war against terrorism , the middle east peace process and on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology , france hopes to steer talks towards alleviating problems of the third world . chirac pushes pro-third world agenda " we need intensive dialogue with developing countries , " the french president said last week .
following what has become almost a tradition at the g8 summit , chirac has invited leaders of five african countries , initiators of the " new partnership for africa 's development " .
in addition , the french president has for the first time invited leaders from china , brazil , mexico , india , saudi-arabia , malaysia and morocco to for a special opening session on global issues on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nurse from medecins sans frontieres lifts tomasinho , 2 , who is suffering from malnutrition , at the hospital in kuito , some 500 miles -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- southeast of luanda , angola , wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the hospital attends to approximately 5,000 people , of which the majority are young children .
medecins sans frontieres , also known as doctors without borders , warned tuesday that malnutrition in angola was the worst its staff had seen since a devastating 1998 famine in sudan .
-lrb- ap photo / marcelo hernandez -rrb- chirac is keen the summit addresses third world issues such as fighting huger and famine and a g8 action plan on africa agreed last year that includes unfufilled measures such as creating an african peacekeeping force .
chirac 's initiative is backed by u.n. secretary-general kofi annan who in a letter to the g8 has pressed for progress on dismantling trade barriers and better access to drugs to fight aids and other diseases in poor countries . " i hope your meeting will discuss , not whether we need to address these challenges , but how we can resolve them , " annan wrote . bush will bring his own , specific suggestions for france and the rest of europe on how to tackle a difficult third-world agenda .
the president wants the european union to reconsider its ban on the import of genetically-modified food which he says can help africans fight famine . he also called for europe to follow america 's lead in pledging billions to fight aids in africa and the carribean . g8 cooperation key to aiding world economy the slumping world economy , which has affected every one of the g8 members will remain a major topic .
the french president has urged world leaders to deliver a optimistic message to kick start the world economy at a time when many of europe 's economies are struggling and the dollar is in a tailspin . financial analysts have underscored the importance of the evian summit addressing the problem and said it could help restore business and investor confidence . " if these guys go to evian and can not show their ability to cooperate , it will be very damaging politically and economically and there would be severe damage in financial markets , " bergsten told reuters . bush has already said he would seek to reassure his g8 partners that washington was on track with its " strong dollar " policy , despite the dollar 's slide to historic lows against the euro in recent days .
" i am going to tell my partners that the united states is conducting a healthy monetary and fiscal policy , " bush told le figaro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 falls short on middle east , africa goals full g8 membership and a $ 20 billion non-proliferation plan for russia , along with $ 1 billion in debt forgiveness for africa , dominated the g8 summit .
but the leaders failed to agree on a plan for middle east peace .

officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .

officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .

" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .
they expect us to say ‘ yes ’ to that what we haven ’ t seen and that is just not on , ” said christian social union general secretary thomas goppel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions rally thousands against schröder 's reform plans germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms .
-lrb- may 25 , 2003 -rrb- schröder urges reform as spd celebrates 140th anniversary as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day .

as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .
four " anti-capitalist " villages set up in the area will offer visitors alternatives to the g8 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator throws a molotov cocktail .
" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .
" all companies -lsb- in the geneva area -rsb- will experience a slowdown from thursday that will run until monday or tuesday , " patrick mayer a member of the chamber of commerce 's management committee , told swissinfo .
" that slowdown obviously carries a pretty tremendous cost . " the financial impact could be compounded by tight security that keeps employees from going to work and consumers from shopping .

heads of the world 's eight leading industrialized nations meet on june 1 in the french spa town of evian for the annual g8 summit with an ambitious agenda and hopes of transatlantic reconciliation . leaders of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit will be heading to the idyllic alpine lakeside resort of evian on june 1 for a grueling three days of talks on topics ranging from the global economy to fighting famine in africa . coming in from st. petersburg , where celebrations will be held to mark the 300th anniversary of the russian city , heads of the united states , canada , japan , germany , france , great britain , italy and russia will be meeting for the first time since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
there are already signs the recently strained transatlantic relationship is likely to dominate talks . vive la france ! : bush extends conciliatory handshake u.s. president george w. bush has plans for a one-on-one meeting with french president jacques chirac , who led a vigorous campaign against the iraq invasion in the united nations security council .
bush said he hoped the meeting would help ease some of the tension between the two countries . " evian will not be a summit of confrontation .
on this trip i am determined to work with france and french leaders , " bush told the french daily le figaro .
" i expect to have a good discussion with jacques chirac , " the president said , adding in french : " vive la france " -lrb- long live france -rrb- . bush indicated he was willing to put behind washington 's anger at the french stance on the war in iraq . " there is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the american people toward the french decision , that 's realistic , " he said .
" i 've got to convince the skeptics in france that the intentions of the united states are positive .
and the french leadership has got work to do to convince the american people that they are concerned about the security of our country .

-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- the u.s. president also had warm words for war opponent russia , saying his country would support moscow 's entry into the world trade organization .
the president did not extend an olive branch to chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , whom he has largely snubbed since schröder turned germany 's opposition to the war into a campaign issue . divisive issues expected at summit the summit is expected to address a host of other contentious issues facing the world and currently dividing various group members . analysts say the differences among the eight need to be laid aside . " this is their first meeting since the war in iraq , " said fred bergsten , director of the washington think-tank institute for international economics in a reuters interview . " evian is a critical moment in restoring the multilateral process . " professor john kirton , head of the university of toronto 's g8 research group wrote in remarks due to be presented at a seminar on the g8 outside paris on tuesday , " seldom before has a g8 so divided confronted an agenda and opportunity so large . " while the bush camp wants the summit to focus on the war against terrorism , the middle east peace process and on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology , france hopes to steer talks towards alleviating problems of the third world . chirac pushes pro-third world agenda " we need intensive dialogue with developing countries , " the french president said last week .
following what has become almost a tradition at the g8 summit , chirac has invited leaders of five african countries , initiators of the " new partnership for africa 's development " .
in addition , the french president has for the first time invited leaders from china , brazil , mexico , india , saudi-arabia , malaysia and morocco to for a special opening session on global issues on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nurse from medecins sans frontieres lifts tomasinho , 2 , who is suffering from malnutrition , at the hospital in kuito , some 500 miles -lrb- 800 kilometers -rrb- southeast of luanda , angola , wednesday , june 12 , 2002 .
the hospital attends to approximately 5,000 people , of which the majority are young children .
medecins sans frontieres , also known as doctors without borders , warned tuesday that malnutrition in angola was the worst its staff had seen since a devastating 1998 famine in sudan .
-lrb- ap photo / marcelo hernandez -rrb- chirac is keen the summit addresses third world issues such as fighting huger and famine and a g8 action plan on africa agreed last year that includes unfufilled measures such as creating an african peacekeeping force .
chirac 's initiative is backed by u.n. secretary-general kofi annan who in a letter to the g8 has pressed for progress on dismantling trade barriers and better access to drugs to fight aids and other diseases in poor countries . " i hope your meeting will discuss , not whether we need to address these challenges , but how we can resolve them , " annan wrote . bush will bring his own , specific suggestions for france and the rest of europe on how to tackle a difficult third-world agenda .
the president wants the european union to reconsider its ban on the import of genetically-modified food which he says can help africans fight famine . he also called for europe to follow america 's lead in pledging billions to fight aids in africa and the carribean . g8 cooperation key to aiding world economy the slumping world economy , which has affected every one of the g8 members will remain a major topic .
the french president has urged world leaders to deliver a optimistic message to kick start the world economy at a time when many of europe 's economies are struggling and the dollar is in a tailspin . financial analysts have underscored the importance of the evian summit addressing the problem and said it could help restore business and investor confidence . " if these guys go to evian and can not show their ability to cooperate , it will be very damaging politically and economically and there would be severe damage in financial markets , " bergsten told reuters . bush has already said he would seek to reassure his g8 partners that washington was on track with its " strong dollar " policy , despite the dollar 's slide to historic lows against the euro in recent days .

germany ’ s social democratic party will come together in berlin on sunday for a special congress to debate proposed welfare and labor reforms that could determine the future of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government . in march , schröder announced a package of sweeping reforms called “ agenda 2010 ” that aims to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but the planned cuts to welfare benefits and loosening of job protection rules have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . that forced schröder to give in to demands from the spd ’ s grassroots for a party congress on june 1 to discuss the reforms .
the event has effectively been turned into a vote of confidence , since schröder has indirectly threatened to resign should the party not back his reform course . “ it ’ s about important , perhaps even historic , decisions , ” schröder told the german news agency dpa in an interview . at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers .
but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .
they expect us to say ‘ yes ’ to that what we haven ’ t seen and that is just not on , ” said christian social union general secretary thomas goppel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions rally thousands against schröder 's reform plans germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2003 evian braces for protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protesters are already making their points , even before world leaders arrive on sunday .
as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .
four " anti-capitalist " villages set up in the area will offer visitors alternatives to the g8 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator throws a molotov cocktail .
" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .
" all companies -lsb- in the geneva area -rsb- will experience a slowdown from thursday that will run until monday or tuesday , " patrick mayer a member of the chamber of commerce 's management committee , told swissinfo .
" that slowdown obviously carries a pretty tremendous cost . " the financial impact could be compounded by tight security that keeps employees from going to work and consumers from shopping .
furthermore , vacationers are steering clear of the area , leaving hotel bookings down by as much as 50 percent . already on thursday the majority of the shops in geneva 's city center had been boarded up , and many residents had left town on vacation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from athens to berlin , a day of protest and anger hundreds of thousands of europeans took to the streets thursday just hours after the u.s.-led attack on iraq began .

but agenda 2010 has opened up a nasty split within his party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots . but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative amid stalling growth and rising unemployment . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system , constricting labor market policies and the global economic downturn .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . majority likely ahead of the weekend party congress , some of the left-wing remained determined to force changes to the government ’ s proposals .
“ on sunday we will introduce quite a few motions for modifications , ” spd regional leader claus möller told dpa .
but a consensus also started to build that schröder would achieve the necessary majority from the spd delegates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig stiegler “ i see that the longer the discussion has been the greater the conviction has become that agenda 2010 must and can be supported , ” spd deputy parliamentary leader ludwig stiegler told zdf television on friday .
“ therefore i expect that in spite of all the criticism over specific details , we will get a very clear majority . ” but even with the general backing from his party , schröder will still have worries about passing his reform plans in parliament .
his center-left coalition of social democrats and greens has only a razor-thin majority in the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , and the conservative opposition controls the upper house the bundesrat , which represents germany ’ s federal states . the conservatives have signalled partial willingness to support necessary restructuring of the welfare system , but are reserving outright support for the legislative initiative until the spd commits itself entirely to the reforms . “ nobody knows what the spd really wants .
they expect us to say ‘ yes ’ to that what we haven ’ t seen and that is just not on , ” said christian social union general secretary thomas goppel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions rally thousands against schröder 's reform plans germany 's powerful trade union 's mobilized tens of thousands of protestors on saturday , in a last ditch attempt to convince the government to shelve its proposed welfare and labor market reforms .

as thousands of protesters descend on switzerland and france in preparation for sunday 's g8 summit , authorities implement measures to insure evian will not become the next genoa or seattle . french authorities have sealed off the small french border town of evian-les-bains in preparation for this year 's g8 summit of the seven most industrialized countries and russia , which kicks off sunday and runs through june 3 . surrounded by mountains and accessible mostly by winding roads , the french chose the resort town because its rugged terrain makes it easier to seal and control movements .
officials were anxious to prevent anti-g8 protesters - 100,000 to 250,000 of whom are expected to turn up - from disrupting the policy meeting . a violent trend in recent years international political and economic conferences have increasingly been accompanied by protests from the anti-globalization movement .
seattle , prague and gothenburg have all become synonymous with the violent clashes between police and demonstrators that have plagued meetings of the world trade organization , the world bank , the european union and the group of 8 . in july 2001 , police brutality - punctuated by the killing of 23-year-old protestor carlo giuliani - overshadowed a meeting of the g8 there . this time , french officials and their neighbors in switzerland are determined to save evian - a town whose name is famous for the water it bottles - from the same fate .
the two countries have been working together to beef up security .
surface-to-air missiles and radar warning systems have been installed to protect the world leaders gathering , and all flights have been banned over the city 's airspace . with much of evian sealed off from outsiders , most of the protests are expected to take place in the nearby french town annemasse and geneva and lausanne in switzerland .
france has sent nearly 15,000 police , soldiers and emergency workers to the area .
switzerland has drafted thousands of police and enlisted the help of 1,000 german troops to ensure safety at geneva 's international airport , where the g8 leaders are expected to arrive . alternative summit thousands of protesters travelled in chartered trains to annemasse and geneva on thursday for a three-day alternative gathering , dubbed the " summit for a different world , " with seminars on hot-button topics like ending poverty and improving the environment . the g8 's opponents represent a wide range of groups , from anarchists to gay rights advocates , humanitarians to farmers and christians to proponents calling for third world debt relief .
four " anti-capitalist " villages set up in the area will offer visitors alternatives to the g8 's vision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator throws a molotov cocktail .
" the g8 is illegitimate and its policies are harmful to the people of the planet .
we have to get rid of it , " jacques nikonoff , president of the anti-globalization group attac , told the french newspaper 20 minutes . protest marches have already begun and are meant to lead up to a final large demonstration with up to 200,000 people on sunday , when the g8 leaders are scheduled to arrive in evian .
protesters will be fueled by the presence of u.s. president george w. bush on a continent were millions demonstrated against the recent u.s.-led war in iraq . disruptions planned organizers say the protesters will block summit participants from reaching their conference rooms in evian .
but with most g8 leaders being airlifted to the site by helicopter , their best chance may be to hinder the delegates and summit officials who need to drive from geneva or take a ferry across the lake to attend the meeting . still , anti-summit organizers too are going out of their way to avoid the violence that marred the genoa summit .
operating under the motto " no genoa in evian , " the protest leaders have pledged not to allow a repeat of 2001 's violence . " we 've taken steps , and those involved in vandalism and violence will be condemned in advance , " nikonoff said .
" they are not part of the alternative world movement . " riots are n't to be expected , lukas engelmann , coordinator for attac germany , told the associated press .
he predicted smaller scuffles , but said the hardcore violent groups were n't interested in evian .
instead , he warned , they were preparing for the european union summit in thessaloniki , greece in late june . footing the bill meanwhile , officials in geneva greeted the anti-summit visitors on thursday with around 70,000 flyers emphasizing that the united nations ' european headquarters was a city of peace and tolerance . but switzerland is n't very happy about having to carry a large share of the summit burden .
the costs for providing security have been estimated at more than € 26 million -lrb- $ 31 million -rrb- , most of the which will be shouldered by swiss taxpayers , swiss radio 's web site swissinfo reported . geneva 's chamber of commerce fears that the loss of business suffered by the local community will add up to another € 33 to 65 million .
" all companies -lsb- in the geneva area -rsb- will experience a slowdown from thursday that will run until monday or tuesday , " patrick mayer a member of the chamber of commerce 's management committee , told swissinfo .
" that slowdown obviously carries a pretty tremendous cost . " the financial impact could be compounded by tight security that keeps employees from going to work and consumers from shopping .
furthermore , vacationers are steering clear of the area , leaving hotel bookings down by as much as 50 percent . already on thursday the majority of the shops in geneva 's city center had been boarded up , and many residents had left town on vacation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from athens to berlin , a day of protest and anger hundreds of thousands of europeans took to the streets thursday just hours after the u.s.-led attack on iraq began .

domestic violence is particularly acute in south asia where traditionally women have been treated as the inferior sex .
talk of domestic violence usually conjures up images of poor , illiterate women , unaware of their rights and economically dependent on their husbands for survival .

vimla mehra is the police officer in-charge of the unit .
she says of the 1,000 complaints they receive each month , about a quarter are from women with backgrounds similar to shruti 's .
" earlier , women from very high classes were not complaining , but now they are aware and do not fear the social stigma as strongly as they did earlier , " she says .
the social stigma may be diminishing , but the number of cases is not .

many women still will not talk about the problem many of the women are from the privileged english-speaking middle and upper classes often working in high-profile jobs .
domestic violence is particularly acute in south asia where traditionally women have been treated as the inferior sex .
talk of domestic violence usually conjures up images of poor , illiterate women , unaware of their rights and economically dependent on their husbands for survival .
but with more and more educated women coming forward with their experiences , that view is changing .
beaten up shruti 's problems began three and a half years ago when she married kumar .
my neighbours knew about it .. . but i never informed my parents shruti the beatings and torture started soon after .
" he would literally beat me up , abuse me , abuse my parents .
he would get drunk and there would be scenes whole night .
" my neighbours knew about it .. but i never informed my parents .
i had a bad fracture -lsb- but -rsb- i told them i had slipped from the stairs . "
shruti is educated , speaks english and belongs to the upper middle-class .
she works for a well-known private firm in delhi and makes enough money to live independently .
but she says she put up with all the abuse believing it was hers to bear for being born as a girl .
striking back it was only after kumar sent her off to her parents ' house and refused to take her back that she sought help .
now , she has been doing the rounds of the crime against women cell , a special police unit to deal with cases faced by women .
some women are fighting back vimla mehra is the police officer in-charge of the unit .
she says of the 1,000 complaints they receive each month , about a quarter are from women with backgrounds similar to shruti 's .
" earlier , women from very high classes were not complaining , but now they are aware and do not fear the social stigma as strongly as they did earlier , " she says .
the social stigma may be diminishing , but the number of cases is not .
one in five women in india has faced domestic violence .
you consider yourself to be an empowered woman .
you consider yourself to be independent , strong and yet it still happens to you manjima bhattacharya and the provocation for abuse can be anything from suspicion about an extra-marital affair to a badly cooked meal .
" there are people who beat their wives only because she has not prepared the food they wanted or at the time they wanted or she has not spoken well to or behaved well with her mother or father-in-law or some other relative of her husband , " says ms mehra .
challenge some say the biggest problem is convincing the women that they do not deserve abuse .
" most women who face domestic violence think it 's a normal part of their life , it 's a part of being a wife , daughter or a sister in law , " says manjima bhattacharya , who works for jagori , a group that uses music and theatre to spread awareness about domestic violence .
" so to convince them that it 's not something that they have done that provokes such a response -lsb- is -rsb- quite a challenge .
" we get cases all the time of educated women who face domestic violence , who are in abusive relationships but it 's just that their walls are much higher and much thicker and you often ca n't hear them speak about it .
it 's difficult for them to come to terms with it .
" you consider yourself to be an empowered woman .
you consider yourself to be independent , strong and yet it still happens to you .
so how do you come to terms with it ? "
that is a challenge the government and society has to deal with .
while the government is debating legislation to reduce the level of domestic violence , activists say real improvement will come only if women themselves confront their abusers .

it will be his first trip to europe since the iraq war and the bitter trans-atlantic debate that preceded it .
on the eve of his departure he said he wanted to set aside us " frustration and disappointment " over french opposition to the iraq war during his europe trip .
the president will make his first stop in poland where he will deliver a key speech on the future of transatlantic relations .
the bbc 's justin webb in washington says it is the most ambitious diplomatic adventure the president has ever undertaken .
it will begin in a very pointed way with mr bush choosing to visit poland to thank the polish government for its support in iraq .
the president will use his stopover in a part of the world his defence secretary calls " new europe " to deliver a speech setting out his view of the future of transatlantic relations .
' frustration with france ' from there he goes to russia for a meeting with president vladimir putin in st petersburg , and to join in ceremonies marking the historic city 's 300th anniversary .
mr bush will then head to evian in france for the g8 summit of leading industrialised nations .
at evian , president bush will be grouped with the main opponents of the iraq war - french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schroeder and president putin .
in an interview with foreign journalists thursday , president bush insisted the evian summit would not be a " confrontational meeting " .
" it 's an opportunity to talk with some who agreed with us on iraq , and some who did n't , about how we move forward , " he said .
but he also made clear his continued annoyance at president chirac for leading opposition to a un security council resolution that would have authorised military force against iraq .
" there is a sense of frustration and disappointment amongst the american people toward the french decision .
that 's realistic .
" people did n't understand the decisions by the french leadership to thwart the american desire and the desire of others to work on security and freedom , " he said .
iraq row ' on one side ' but president bush said this would not influence his policy and he looked forward to talking to mr chirac , as well as others who had agreed with us policy on iraq .
he will have face-to-face encounters with president chirac and chancellor schroeder .
our washington correspondent says the official white house view is that the row over iraq will be put to one side .
mr bush is reported to have told a german delegation that there will " not be a fist fight " .
next tuesday before the official end of the g8 summit , mr bush will head to the middle east for the toughest work of his trip , including a meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers .
