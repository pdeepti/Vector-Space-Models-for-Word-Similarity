dw-world looks at the growing economic ties strengthening a new political alliance . last month , germany came together with france and russia in the united nations security council to oppose military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
though the trio failed to stop the united states from going to war , the new the alignment of german-russian political interests follows a similar convergence in economic relations . schröder ’ s trip to putin 's hometown had been scheduled as part of the third so-called ‘ petersburger dialogue ’ , a bilateral meeting of russian and german politicians and businessmen to discuss relations between the two countries .
but with war in the persian gulf , french president jacques chirac will join the two leaders over the weekend to push for a central united nations role in postwar iraq . putin , a fluent german speaker from his kgb days in east germany , has built a warm personal relationship with schröder , allowing cultural and business ties between the two nations to flourish in recent years . besides discussing iraq , schröder will receive an honorary doctorate from the local university and will also attend festivities celebrating 150 years of russian business ties by the german industrial giant siemens . russia ’ s largest investor germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry . “ german-russian trade has developed extremely well , ” said andrea von knoop , the head of a german business in moscow .
“ considering the market ’ s huge potential , we really believe things can still increase even more . ” she said german exports to russia grew by a massive 54 percent in 2001 and by another 11 percent last year to total € 11.4 billion .
to keep things in perspective , exports to france , germany ’ s most import trading partner , were seven times larger .
but that just makes people like von knoop more positive about the future potential of german-russian trade . “ now is the time to jump in here , ” said von knoop .
“ in the next couple of years the competition will noticeably increase – not from foreign competitors – but from the domestic players . ” as western europe ’ s larger economies have stagnated in recent years , russia ’ s appears to have finally found its feet .
growth has been brisk after the hard years following the collapse of the soviet union and the domestic financial crisis of 1998 .
and moscow hopes to cement its market reforms by joining the world trade organization in the coming months . wto dispute the european union has help up russian wto membership due to a dispute over energy pricing .
the e.u. says russia subsidizes energy costs for its domestic industry to the tune of € 1.5 billion each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto logo but some observers think france and germany may now be willing to look the other way on the issue to reward moscow for supporting their anti-war position on iraq . “ russia ’ s threatened veto against the american-british attack on iraq strengthened the position of the war opponents in the european union , ” wrote katja tichomirowa in the berliner zeitung newspaper .
“ france and germany could reward russia by compromising on the wto membership issue . ” such a move would certainly help cement what could eventually become an e.u.-russian counterweight to a currently unrivaled american superpower .
and that ’ s something some people have already begin to contemplate . “ if germany in the future wants to work more closely with russian and france on important and strategic political and moral questions , we must and will accept that , ” said jeffery gedmin , the director of the berlin office of the aspen institute , an american think-tank . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free . sales of german records slumped over 11 percent last year , the second consecutive double-digit decline .
for the industry there is only one cause for the drop : illegally downloaded music from internet peer-to-peer sites like kazaa , grokster and limewire . in response , major music labels in germany and across europe have teamed up to launch a so-called “ digital download day ” to raise consumer awareness of the existence of legal digital music services . though the initiative is billed as a “ day ” , the campaign will actually run for over a week starting april 9 .
during that time internet users can legally download over 160,000 titles from most the industry giants , including sony , universal and bmg .
joining the effort are several smaller independent labels . terrified industry all are terrified by the legacy of the first wildly successful file-sharing service napster and the damage the industry says kazaa and its ilk are doing to music sales . an estimated 14 million people download music for free and burn it to cds each month worldwide , according to german music industry representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musician and singer peter gabriel .
behind the digital download day effort is od2 , the digital music distribution company set up by british musician peter gabriel in 1999 .
the company ran a first trial of the download concept in britain last year .
this time the event includes germany , france , spain , italy and the netherlands . “ the industry has really rallied to the call to nurture and support the legitimate music market - their support will prove indispensable in drawing the attention of music fans to this event , ” said od2 chief executive charles grimsdale . once users register for € 5 , they will be able to listen to and download up to three albums worth of tracks until april 15 .
od2 says it has the largest catalogue of legal digital music in europe , providing the only subscription service in europe that offers consumers the opportunity to burn as well as stream and download tracks . “ the real mistake made was that the internet at first was acknowledged but not really recognized as a market , ” said christoph schick , one of the german industry initiators of digital download day .
“ but the internet is a future business area and we have to invest now if we want to be a part of that future .
otherwise we ’ ve lost everything and users will stay on the illegal file-swapping services . ” stamping out napster clones he argues the music industry should have spent more time building commercial sites instead of only concentrating on stamping out illegal file-swapping services like napster and audio galaxy . “ file-swapping services don ’ t have uniform quality and titles are often wrong or incomplete , ” said schick .

but with war in the persian gulf , french president jacques chirac will join the two leaders over the weekend to push for a central united nations role in postwar iraq . putin , a fluent german speaker from his kgb days in east germany , has built a warm personal relationship with schröder , allowing cultural and business ties between the two nations to flourish in recent years . besides discussing iraq , schröder will receive an honorary doctorate from the local university and will also attend festivities celebrating 150 years of russian business ties by the german industrial giant siemens . russia ’ s largest investor germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .

“ in the next couple of years the competition will noticeably increase – not from foreign competitors – but from the domestic players . ” as western europe ’ s larger economies have stagnated in recent years , russia ’ s appears to have finally found its feet .

dw-world looks at the growing economic ties strengthening a new political alliance . last month , germany came together with france and russia in the united nations security council to oppose military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
though the trio failed to stop the united states from going to war , the new the alignment of german-russian political interests follows a similar convergence in economic relations . schröder ’ s trip to putin 's hometown had been scheduled as part of the third so-called ‘ petersburger dialogue ’ , a bilateral meeting of russian and german politicians and businessmen to discuss relations between the two countries .
but with war in the persian gulf , french president jacques chirac will join the two leaders over the weekend to push for a central united nations role in postwar iraq . putin , a fluent german speaker from his kgb days in east germany , has built a warm personal relationship with schröder , allowing cultural and business ties between the two nations to flourish in recent years . besides discussing iraq , schröder will receive an honorary doctorate from the local university and will also attend festivities celebrating 150 years of russian business ties by the german industrial giant siemens . russia ’ s largest investor germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry . “ german-russian trade has developed extremely well , ” said andrea von knoop , the head of a german business in moscow .
“ considering the market ’ s huge potential , we really believe things can still increase even more . ” she said german exports to russia grew by a massive 54 percent in 2001 and by another 11 percent last year to total € 11.4 billion .
to keep things in perspective , exports to france , germany ’ s most import trading partner , were seven times larger .
but that just makes people like von knoop more positive about the future potential of german-russian trade . “ now is the time to jump in here , ” said von knoop .
“ in the next couple of years the competition will noticeably increase – not from foreign competitors – but from the domestic players . ” as western europe ’ s larger economies have stagnated in recent years , russia ’ s appears to have finally found its feet .
growth has been brisk after the hard years following the collapse of the soviet union and the domestic financial crisis of 1998 .
and moscow hopes to cement its market reforms by joining the world trade organization in the coming months . wto dispute the european union has help up russian wto membership due to a dispute over energy pricing .
the e.u. says russia subsidizes energy costs for its domestic industry to the tune of € 1.5 billion each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto logo but some observers think france and germany may now be willing to look the other way on the issue to reward moscow for supporting their anti-war position on iraq . “ russia ’ s threatened veto against the american-british attack on iraq strengthened the position of the war opponents in the european union , ” wrote katja tichomirowa in the berliner zeitung newspaper .
“ france and germany could reward russia by compromising on the wto membership issue . ” such a move would certainly help cement what could eventually become an e.u.-russian counterweight to a currently unrivaled american superpower .
and that ’ s something some people have already begin to contemplate . “ if germany in the future wants to work more closely with russian and france on important and strategic political and moral questions , we must and will accept that , ” said jeffery gedmin , the director of the berlin office of the aspen institute , an american think-tank . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free . sales of german records slumped over 11 percent last year , the second consecutive double-digit decline .
for the industry there is only one cause for the drop : illegally downloaded music from internet peer-to-peer sites like kazaa , grokster and limewire . in response , major music labels in germany and across europe have teamed up to launch a so-called “ digital download day ” to raise consumer awareness of the existence of legal digital music services . though the initiative is billed as a “ day ” , the campaign will actually run for over a week starting april 9 .
during that time internet users can legally download over 160,000 titles from most the industry giants , including sony , universal and bmg .
joining the effort are several smaller independent labels . terrified industry all are terrified by the legacy of the first wildly successful file-sharing service napster and the damage the industry says kazaa and its ilk are doing to music sales . an estimated 14 million people download music for free and burn it to cds each month worldwide , according to german music industry representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musician and singer peter gabriel .

od2 says it has the largest catalogue of legal digital music in europe , providing the only subscription service in europe that offers consumers the opportunity to burn as well as stream and download tracks . “ the real mistake made was that the internet at first was acknowledged but not really recognized as a market , ” said christoph schick , one of the german industry initiators of digital download day .
“ but the internet is a future business area and we have to invest now if we want to be a part of that future .
otherwise we ’ ve lost everything and users will stay on the illegal file-swapping services . ” stamping out napster clones he argues the music industry should have spent more time building commercial sites instead of only concentrating on stamping out illegal file-swapping services like napster and audio galaxy . “ file-swapping services don ’ t have uniform quality and titles are often wrong or incomplete , ” said schick .
“ we think it will be more attractive from a central server with reliable quality and speed 24 hours a day . ” unfortunately the german digital download day site didn ’ t appear to offer the quality and service that most observers think it will take to wean internet users away from other file-swapping sites . some of the official portals said it could take “ a few days ” to register before any music could be downloaded .

though the trio failed to stop the united states from going to war , the new the alignment of german-russian political interests follows a similar convergence in economic relations . schröder ’ s trip to putin 's hometown had been scheduled as part of the third so-called ‘ petersburger dialogue ’ , a bilateral meeting of russian and german politicians and businessmen to discuss relations between the two countries .
but with war in the persian gulf , french president jacques chirac will join the two leaders over the weekend to push for a central united nations role in postwar iraq . putin , a fluent german speaker from his kgb days in east germany , has built a warm personal relationship with schröder , allowing cultural and business ties between the two nations to flourish in recent years . besides discussing iraq , schröder will receive an honorary doctorate from the local university and will also attend festivities celebrating 150 years of russian business ties by the german industrial giant siemens . russia ’ s largest investor germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry . “ german-russian trade has developed extremely well , ” said andrea von knoop , the head of a german business in moscow .
“ considering the market ’ s huge potential , we really believe things can still increase even more . ” she said german exports to russia grew by a massive 54 percent in 2001 and by another 11 percent last year to total € 11.4 billion .

though the trio failed to stop the united states from going to war , the new the alignment of german-russian political interests follows a similar convergence in economic relations . schröder ’ s trip to putin 's hometown had been scheduled as part of the third so-called ‘ petersburger dialogue ’ , a bilateral meeting of russian and german politicians and businessmen to discuss relations between the two countries .
but with war in the persian gulf , french president jacques chirac will join the two leaders over the weekend to push for a central united nations role in postwar iraq . putin , a fluent german speaker from his kgb days in east germany , has built a warm personal relationship with schröder , allowing cultural and business ties between the two nations to flourish in recent years . besides discussing iraq , schröder will receive an honorary doctorate from the local university and will also attend festivities celebrating 150 years of russian business ties by the german industrial giant siemens . russia ’ s largest investor germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry . “ german-russian trade has developed extremely well , ” said andrea von knoop , the head of a german business in moscow .
“ considering the market ’ s huge potential , we really believe things can still increase even more . ” she said german exports to russia grew by a massive 54 percent in 2001 and by another 11 percent last year to total € 11.4 billion .
to keep things in perspective , exports to france , germany ’ s most import trading partner , were seven times larger .
but that just makes people like von knoop more positive about the future potential of german-russian trade . “ now is the time to jump in here , ” said von knoop .
“ in the next couple of years the competition will noticeably increase – not from foreign competitors – but from the domestic players . ” as western europe ’ s larger economies have stagnated in recent years , russia ’ s appears to have finally found its feet .
growth has been brisk after the hard years following the collapse of the soviet union and the domestic financial crisis of 1998 .

“ france and germany could reward russia by compromising on the wto membership issue . ” such a move would certainly help cement what could eventually become an e.u.-russian counterweight to a currently unrivaled american superpower .
and that ’ s something some people have already begin to contemplate . “ if germany in the future wants to work more closely with russian and france on important and strategic political and moral questions , we must and will accept that , ” said jeffery gedmin , the director of the berlin office of the aspen institute , an american think-tank . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free . sales of german records slumped over 11 percent last year , the second consecutive double-digit decline .
for the industry there is only one cause for the drop : illegally downloaded music from internet peer-to-peer sites like kazaa , grokster and limewire . in response , major music labels in germany and across europe have teamed up to launch a so-called “ digital download day ” to raise consumer awareness of the existence of legal digital music services . though the initiative is billed as a “ day ” , the campaign will actually run for over a week starting april 9 .
during that time internet users can legally download over 160,000 titles from most the industry giants , including sony , universal and bmg .
joining the effort are several smaller independent labels . terrified industry all are terrified by the legacy of the first wildly successful file-sharing service napster and the damage the industry says kazaa and its ilk are doing to music sales . an estimated 14 million people download music for free and burn it to cds each month worldwide , according to german music industry representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : musician and singer peter gabriel .

the company ran a first trial of the download concept in britain last year .
this time the event includes germany , france , spain , italy and the netherlands . “ the industry has really rallied to the call to nurture and support the legitimate music market - their support will prove indispensable in drawing the attention of music fans to this event , ” said od2 chief executive charles grimsdale . once users register for € 5 , they will be able to listen to and download up to three albums worth of tracks until april 15 .
od2 says it has the largest catalogue of legal digital music in europe , providing the only subscription service in europe that offers consumers the opportunity to burn as well as stream and download tracks . “ the real mistake made was that the internet at first was acknowledged but not really recognized as a market , ” said christoph schick , one of the german industry initiators of digital download day .

dw-world looks at the growing economic ties strengthening a new political alliance . last month , germany came together with france and russia in the united nations security council to oppose military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
though the trio failed to stop the united states from going to war , the new the alignment of german-russian political interests follows a similar convergence in economic relations . schröder ’ s trip to putin 's hometown had been scheduled as part of the third so-called ‘ petersburger dialogue ’ , a bilateral meeting of russian and german politicians and businessmen to discuss relations between the two countries .
but with war in the persian gulf , french president jacques chirac will join the two leaders over the weekend to push for a central united nations role in postwar iraq . putin , a fluent german speaker from his kgb days in east germany , has built a warm personal relationship with schröder , allowing cultural and business ties between the two nations to flourish in recent years . besides discussing iraq , schröder will receive an honorary doctorate from the local university and will also attend festivities celebrating 150 years of russian business ties by the german industrial giant siemens . russia ’ s largest investor germany is easily the largest foreign investor in russia , with private companies such as siemens investing alone over € 8 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- .
germany is also the country ’ s largest european trading partner : whereas germany provides capital and high-quality manufactured goods , russia reciprocates with raw materials and energy products to fuel german industry . “ german-russian trade has developed extremely well , ” said andrea von knoop , the head of a german business in moscow .
“ considering the market ’ s huge potential , we really believe things can still increase even more . ” she said german exports to russia grew by a massive 54 percent in 2001 and by another 11 percent last year to total € 11.4 billion .
to keep things in perspective , exports to france , germany ’ s most import trading partner , were seven times larger .
but that just makes people like von knoop more positive about the future potential of german-russian trade . “ now is the time to jump in here , ” said von knoop .
“ in the next couple of years the competition will noticeably increase – not from foreign competitors – but from the domestic players . ” as western europe ’ s larger economies have stagnated in recent years , russia ’ s appears to have finally found its feet .
growth has been brisk after the hard years following the collapse of the soviet union and the domestic financial crisis of 1998 .
and moscow hopes to cement its market reforms by joining the world trade organization in the coming months . wto dispute the european union has help up russian wto membership due to a dispute over energy pricing .
the e.u. says russia subsidizes energy costs for its domestic industry to the tune of € 1.5 billion each year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto logo but some observers think france and germany may now be willing to look the other way on the issue to reward moscow for supporting their anti-war position on iraq . “ russia ’ s threatened veto against the american-british attack on iraq strengthened the position of the war opponents in the european union , ” wrote katja tichomirowa in the berliner zeitung newspaper .
“ france and germany could reward russia by compromising on the wto membership issue . ” such a move would certainly help cement what could eventually become an e.u.-russian counterweight to a currently unrivaled american superpower .
and that ’ s something some people have already begin to contemplate . “ if germany in the future wants to work more closely with russian and france on important and strategic political and moral questions , we must and will accept that , ” said jeffery gedmin , the director of the berlin office of the aspen institute , an american think-tank . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de disputed german art collection causes political row in russia the ongoing struggle to return artwork taken from germany during the last days of world war ii has caused a political conflict in russia as a disputed collection of drawings recently went on display in moscow .

breakfast heard from our correspondents in baghdad and doha ; as well as iraqis living in the uk in a specially extended programme .
but despite yesterday 's celebrations when a statue of saddam hussein was torn down by us marines and iraqi people , there has been some continued fighting throughout the night .
the united states says the campaign to rid iraq of saddam 's regime will last for some time .
american planes have been bombing saddam 's home town of tikrit and kurdish forces continue their push for the northern cities of mosul and arbil .
there has been more looting and civil disorder in basra and baghdad , and with the iraqi regime in tatters , efforts will now focus on installing an interim government .
and most pressing of all in the coming days , will be the ongoing efforts to get aid : food , fresh water and medical supplies to the iraqi people although aid agencies say it is still too dangerous to provide help .
the red cross says that the situation is chaotic and unpredictable .
on breakfast we heard from mohammed al hilli , an iraqi who 's spent most of his life living in britain - he gave us his reaction to events " iraqis are celebrating with caution " he said : it was an unbelievable feeling , overwhelming and he could n't believe what had happened .
he said he was happy and that it was a day of victory for people who have been oppressed .
he added that the joy of celebrations would not be complete until he knew that his family in iraq were safe .
click here to see out interview with mohammed al hilli rageh omaar gave us the latest from baghdad after yesterday 's historical scenes " there 's a lot of fighting with the 3rd infantry division " he said : the american marines have taken up positions on the eastern side of the river .
some are still fighting small pockets of resistance .
there is fighting at the mosque on the tigris river where it 's believed saddam is may be hiding .
the fighting is mainly on the outskirts of the city .
it would be dangerous few days - pulling down the statue spoke volumes but there was still looting - there is an enormous amount of work to do as the area is ' stabilised ' click here to see rageh 's report and paul adams was at the coalition headquarters in doha , qatar " there are still pockets of resistance " paul talked about the kurdish run areas and the ground they were hoping to take , he said eyes would eventually turn to tikrit saddam 's powerbase .
it could be shielding iraqi fighters loyal to saddam .
the us fourth infantry could have the job of ' sorting out ' tikrit - at the moment they were still in kuwait and it would take a couple of days to move them .
he added that the last stage has unfolded much more quickly than expected ... officials at central command doha were saying that they were surprised that they had got to this stage as quick as they had , the last four days had been very quick .
he said syria had been warned not to get involved and there was some suggestion that saddam 's chemical weapons may have been ' spirited ' out into syria , although the british were not convinced about this .

there is also increasing evidence that grandparents are being asked to pick up the pieces of the children 's lives , often without financial help or professional support .
the figure has been uncovered by researchers at glasgow university who claim there is a major growth in the number of youngsters being cared for by other family members .
they are warning that the problem is leaving grandparents in a difficult position .
professor neil mckeganey , from the centre for drug misuse research , has warned that only a tiny fraction of those children are known about by official services .
fillling the gap " it can undermine every conceivable aspect of these children 's lives - their relationships with parents , their relationships with friends , their relationship with siblings , their performance in school , their daily routines , " prof mckeganey said .
he claims that grandparents are filling the gap of the parents , quite often putting their own lives on hold .
" they often have to explain to the children where their parents are , if their parents are alive , or are they going to die at any moment as a result of their drug use , " he added .
" it 's very difficult because the drug user is the grandparents ' own child so they have all the feelings associated with having their own child as an addict and also all the sense of responsibility and guilt and lack of support with looking after the grandchildren . "

the two almost inaccessible lakes at upton were recently bought by the norfolk wildlife trust following a successful fundraising appeal .
few people have visited upton broad since the end of the thatching industry led to the decline of nearby communities .
tony pollack of the norfolk wildlife trust said : " we are in a spot really which has had no public access to my knowledge in its entire history . "
now the trust plans to turn the area into a 650-acre wetland nature reserve , and conserve the habitat of rare creatures such as marsh harriers , bitterns and water voles .
mr pollack said it was important to preserve such a pristine area .
" one of the reasons why this broad is an unusual feature is because a lot of the broads are connected to river systems and they are prone to being polluted .
" whereas if you look into the water here , it 's absolutely clear . "
mr pollack said a priority was to restore reed and sedge beds for otters , water voles , bitterns and marsh harriers .
but trust director brendan joyce warned that such essential work would not be cheap .
" we spent something like £ 375,000 getting this far but the real bill is going to come in over the next 10 years as we gradually restore the land back to its favourable condition . "
the trust hopes it will one day be able to open upton broad to the public .
