the attacks , which targeted locations populated by westerners , have been widely blamed on " international terrorists " with the u.s. suggesting that they bear the hallmarks of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network .

" our only chance is not protection , we don ’ t have that many police anywhere in the world .
we must smash these networks and get intelligence in the best form we can . "

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2003 bombings rekindle terrorism fears in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombings in the coastal town of casablanca have fueled fears of international terrorism .
interior ministers of the eu ’ s “ big five ” countries are meeting to review security amid a backdrop of devastating bombings and fears in europe that al qaeda activity is on the rise . interior ministers of germany , france , spain , great britain and italy are seeking ways to counter the danger posed by international terroris following recent attacks on the morrocan city of casablanca on friday night that killed dozens , including eight europeans .
in a two-day meeting near the southern spanish city of jerez on sunday , the ministers are discussing plans for intensifying cooperation against international terrorism and illegal immigration .
eu ministers sound alarm bells after the first day of talks on sunday , the ministers warned that dormant islamic terrorist cells could strike at any time .
" no one can say they are excluded or safe from an attempted attack by radical islamic terrorism and that is exactly why we have to reinforce all our security measures , " spanish interior minister angel acebes said .
acebes added that the five interior ministers had agreed on setting up a working group to deal with illegal immigration and terrorism and to meet every three months to review progress .
the minister said international cooperation in fighting terrorism was " absolutely indispensable " and " new instruments " within the european union shouldn ’ t just lead to better cooperation between police authorities , but also between justices as well as enable a common legislation .
pisanu said italy had identified 6,150 potential terrorists targets in his country and added that illegal immigration further complicated the task facing authorities .
an estimated 500,000 people pour into the 15-nation european union illegally each year .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy called the war against terror a " war that will be waged in the future . "
al-qaeda signature on latest attacks ?
the meeting of eu interior ministers comes at the end of a week which saw a string of suicide bomb blasts kill 34 in saudi arabia and more recently 41 in morocco , injuring scores .
the attacks , which targeted locations populated by westerners , have been widely blamed on " international terrorists " with the u.s. suggesting that they bear the hallmarks of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network .
president bush issued a " wake-up call " to the world over the weekend , that while al-qaeda had been weakened by the u.s.-led war on terror it remained a threat .
both saudi arabia and morocco , arab kingdoms with historically close ties with washington , have said local terrorist groups " with international links " are responsible for the attacks .
on sunday , moroccan justice minister mohamed bouzoubaa suggested some of the 13 suicide bombers who carried out the carnage in casablanca , were members of a little-known local group , assirat al moustaquim which is sympathetic to al qaeda .
moroccan police rounded up 33 suspects on sunday , including some linked to the radical salafist jihad group .
saudi authorities said on sunday they were seriously probing al qaeda links to last monday ’ s bombings in the capital riyadh .
they also said they had detained four suspected al-qaeda members who they allege had prior knowledge of the suicide bombings .
german intelligence : al qaeda active again the theory that al qaeda could be behind the latest wave of suicides attacks has large support among security authorities in europe , who fear a resurgence of the network .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily said in a television interview sunday that he suspected al qaeda had a hand in the latest bombings .
" it ’ s highly likely , the hallmarks of the attacks in riyadh and casablanca all point towards it , " he said .
schily also urged a resolved effort to clamp down on terrorism .
" our only chance is not protection , we don ’ t have that many police anywhere in the world .
we must smash these networks and get intelligence in the best form we can . "
the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- also said in a report on sunday that the al qaeda group has regrouped itself and was once again financially in a position to carry out terrorist attacks simultaneously worldwide .
" support bases and recruiting potential in saudi arabia , as well as in yemen , united arab emirates and kuwait are intact , " the report said .
german intelligence officials also point out in the report that osama bin laden is still alive and lived on the outskirts of pakistan , though the network is now headed by new younger members .
the bnd has also warned that the terrorist network was planning attacks in afghanistan in particular against the multinational peacekeeping force , which includes 2,400 german soldiers .
western governments issue travel alerts the warnings about al qaeda ’ s possible activities come amid a wave of terror alerts issued by western governments , urging its citizens from travelling to the middle east and africa .
the german foreign ministry over the weekend advised german nationals against visiting east africa and morocco , and asked them to be on high alert if they were visiting uganda , ethiopia and eritrea .

interior ministers of the eu ’ s “ big five ” countries are meeting to review security amid a backdrop of devastating bombings and fears in europe that al qaeda activity is on the rise . interior ministers of germany , france , spain , great britain and italy are seeking ways to counter the danger posed by international terroris following recent attacks on the morrocan city of casablanca on friday night that killed dozens , including eight europeans .
in a two-day meeting near the southern spanish city of jerez on sunday , the ministers are discussing plans for intensifying cooperation against international terrorism and illegal immigration .
eu ministers sound alarm bells after the first day of talks on sunday , the ministers warned that dormant islamic terrorist cells could strike at any time .
" no one can say they are excluded or safe from an attempted attack by radical islamic terrorism and that is exactly why we have to reinforce all our security measures , " spanish interior minister angel acebes said .
acebes added that the five interior ministers had agreed on setting up a working group to deal with illegal immigration and terrorism and to meet every three months to review progress .
the minister said international cooperation in fighting terrorism was " absolutely indispensable " and " new instruments " within the european union shouldn ’ t just lead to better cooperation between police authorities , but also between justices as well as enable a common legislation .
pisanu said italy had identified 6,150 potential terrorists targets in his country and added that illegal immigration further complicated the task facing authorities .
an estimated 500,000 people pour into the 15-nation european union illegally each year .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy called the war against terror a " war that will be waged in the future . "
al-qaeda signature on latest attacks ?
the meeting of eu interior ministers comes at the end of a week which saw a string of suicide bomb blasts kill 34 in saudi arabia and more recently 41 in morocco , injuring scores .
the attacks , which targeted locations populated by westerners , have been widely blamed on " international terrorists " with the u.s. suggesting that they bear the hallmarks of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network .
president bush issued a " wake-up call " to the world over the weekend , that while al-qaeda had been weakened by the u.s.-led war on terror it remained a threat .
both saudi arabia and morocco , arab kingdoms with historically close ties with washington , have said local terrorist groups " with international links " are responsible for the attacks .
on sunday , moroccan justice minister mohamed bouzoubaa suggested some of the 13 suicide bombers who carried out the carnage in casablanca , were members of a little-known local group , assirat al moustaquim which is sympathetic to al qaeda .
moroccan police rounded up 33 suspects on sunday , including some linked to the radical salafist jihad group .
saudi authorities said on sunday they were seriously probing al qaeda links to last monday ’ s bombings in the capital riyadh .
they also said they had detained four suspected al-qaeda members who they allege had prior knowledge of the suicide bombings .
german intelligence : al qaeda active again the theory that al qaeda could be behind the latest wave of suicides attacks has large support among security authorities in europe , who fear a resurgence of the network .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily said in a television interview sunday that he suspected al qaeda had a hand in the latest bombings .
" it ’ s highly likely , the hallmarks of the attacks in riyadh and casablanca all point towards it , " he said .
schily also urged a resolved effort to clamp down on terrorism .
" our only chance is not protection , we don ’ t have that many police anywhere in the world .
we must smash these networks and get intelligence in the best form we can . "
the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- also said in a report on sunday that the al qaeda group has regrouped itself and was once again financially in a position to carry out terrorist attacks simultaneously worldwide .
" support bases and recruiting potential in saudi arabia , as well as in yemen , united arab emirates and kuwait are intact , " the report said .
german intelligence officials also point out in the report that osama bin laden is still alive and lived on the outskirts of pakistan , though the network is now headed by new younger members .
the bnd has also warned that the terrorist network was planning attacks in afghanistan in particular against the multinational peacekeeping force , which includes 2,400 german soldiers .
western governments issue travel alerts the warnings about al qaeda ’ s possible activities come amid a wave of terror alerts issued by western governments , urging its citizens from travelling to the middle east and africa .
the german foreign ministry over the weekend advised german nationals against visiting east africa and morocco , and asked them to be on high alert if they were visiting uganda , ethiopia and eritrea .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the far-right vlaams blok -lrb- flemish bloc -rrb- filip dewinter , center , vlaams blok , which campaigns for zero tolerance on crime and takes a strong anti-immigrant line , has seen its support base spreading from urban strongholds into rural areas .
" this is a very important victory for the vlaams blok , " party leader filip dewinter -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters .
greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .
though officially bilingual , belgium ’ s population is divided regionally and linguistically into the northern flemish-speaking flanders , francophone walloon to the south and the capital of brussels as an independent region .
the result is that the country ’ s 10 million people have six governments : one federal , three regional , one francophone and one flemish .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the far-right vlaams blok -lrb- flemish bloc -rrb- filip dewinter , center , vlaams blok , which campaigns for zero tolerance on crime and takes a strong anti-immigrant line , has seen its support base spreading from urban strongholds into rural areas .
" this is a very important victory for the vlaams blok , " party leader filip dewinter -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters .
greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .
though officially bilingual , belgium ’ s population is divided regionally and linguistically into the northern flemish-speaking flanders , francophone walloon to the south and the capital of brussels as an independent region .
the result is that the country ’ s 10 million people have six governments : one federal , three regional , one francophone and one flemish .
the political parties are also organized along linguistic lines and obliged to form coalitions with each other to reach a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the far-right vlaams blok -lrb- flemish bloc -rrb- filip dewinter , center , vlaams blok , which campaigns for zero tolerance on crime and takes a strong anti-immigrant line , has seen its support base spreading from urban strongholds into rural areas .
" this is a very important victory for the vlaams blok , " party leader filip dewinter -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters .
greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .

interior ministers of the eu ’ s “ big five ” countries are meeting to review security amid a backdrop of devastating bombings and fears in europe that al qaeda activity is on the rise . interior ministers of germany , france , spain , great britain and italy are seeking ways to counter the danger posed by international terroris following recent attacks on the morrocan city of casablanca on friday night that killed dozens , including eight europeans .
in a two-day meeting near the southern spanish city of jerez on sunday , the ministers are discussing plans for intensifying cooperation against international terrorism and illegal immigration .
eu ministers sound alarm bells after the first day of talks on sunday , the ministers warned that dormant islamic terrorist cells could strike at any time .
" no one can say they are excluded or safe from an attempted attack by radical islamic terrorism and that is exactly why we have to reinforce all our security measures , " spanish interior minister angel acebes said .
acebes added that the five interior ministers had agreed on setting up a working group to deal with illegal immigration and terrorism and to meet every three months to review progress .
the minister said international cooperation in fighting terrorism was " absolutely indispensable " and " new instruments " within the european union shouldn ’ t just lead to better cooperation between police authorities , but also between justices as well as enable a common legislation .
pisanu said italy had identified 6,150 potential terrorists targets in his country and added that illegal immigration further complicated the task facing authorities .
an estimated 500,000 people pour into the 15-nation european union illegally each year .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy called the war against terror a " war that will be waged in the future . "
al-qaeda signature on latest attacks ?
the meeting of eu interior ministers comes at the end of a week which saw a string of suicide bomb blasts kill 34 in saudi arabia and more recently 41 in morocco , injuring scores .
the attacks , which targeted locations populated by westerners , have been widely blamed on " international terrorists " with the u.s. suggesting that they bear the hallmarks of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network .
president bush issued a " wake-up call " to the world over the weekend , that while al-qaeda had been weakened by the u.s.-led war on terror it remained a threat .
both saudi arabia and morocco , arab kingdoms with historically close ties with washington , have said local terrorist groups " with international links " are responsible for the attacks .
on sunday , moroccan justice minister mohamed bouzoubaa suggested some of the 13 suicide bombers who carried out the carnage in casablanca , were members of a little-known local group , assirat al moustaquim which is sympathetic to al qaeda .
moroccan police rounded up 33 suspects on sunday , including some linked to the radical salafist jihad group .
saudi authorities said on sunday they were seriously probing al qaeda links to last monday ’ s bombings in the capital riyadh .
they also said they had detained four suspected al-qaeda members who they allege had prior knowledge of the suicide bombings .
german intelligence : al qaeda active again the theory that al qaeda could be behind the latest wave of suicides attacks has large support among security authorities in europe , who fear a resurgence of the network .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily said in a television interview sunday that he suspected al qaeda had a hand in the latest bombings .
" it ’ s highly likely , the hallmarks of the attacks in riyadh and casablanca all point towards it , " he said .
schily also urged a resolved effort to clamp down on terrorism .
" our only chance is not protection , we don ’ t have that many police anywhere in the world .
we must smash these networks and get intelligence in the best form we can . "
the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- also said in a report on sunday that the al qaeda group has regrouped itself and was once again financially in a position to carry out terrorist attacks simultaneously worldwide .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the far-right vlaams blok -lrb- flemish bloc -rrb- filip dewinter , center , vlaams blok , which campaigns for zero tolerance on crime and takes a strong anti-immigrant line , has seen its support base spreading from urban strongholds into rural areas .
" this is a very important victory for the vlaams blok , " party leader filip dewinter -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters .
greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .
though officially bilingual , belgium ’ s population is divided regionally and linguistically into the northern flemish-speaking flanders , francophone walloon to the south and the capital of brussels as an independent region .
the result is that the country ’ s 10 million people have six governments : one federal , three regional , one francophone and one flemish .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the far-right vlaams blok -lrb- flemish bloc -rrb- filip dewinter , center , vlaams blok , which campaigns for zero tolerance on crime and takes a strong anti-immigrant line , has seen its support base spreading from urban strongholds into rural areas .
" this is a very important victory for the vlaams blok , " party leader filip dewinter -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters .
greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .
though officially bilingual , belgium ’ s population is divided regionally and linguistically into the northern flemish-speaking flanders , francophone walloon to the south and the capital of brussels as an independent region .
the result is that the country ’ s 10 million people have six governments : one federal , three regional , one francophone and one flemish .
the political parties are also organized along linguistic lines and obliged to form coalitions with each other to reach a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the far-right vlaams blok -lrb- flemish bloc -rrb- filip dewinter , center , vlaams blok , which campaigns for zero tolerance on crime and takes a strong anti-immigrant line , has seen its support base spreading from urban strongholds into rural areas .
" this is a very important victory for the vlaams blok , " party leader filip dewinter -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters .
greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .
though officially bilingual , belgium ’ s population is divided regionally and linguistically into the northern flemish-speaking flanders , francophone walloon to the south and the capital of brussels as an independent region .
the result is that the country ’ s 10 million people have six governments : one federal , three regional , one francophone and one flemish .
the political parties are also organized along linguistic lines and obliged to form coalitions with each other to reach a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the far-right vlaams blok -lrb- flemish bloc -rrb- filip dewinter , center , vlaams blok , which campaigns for zero tolerance on crime and takes a strong anti-immigrant line , has seen its support base spreading from urban strongholds into rural areas .
" this is a very important victory for the vlaams blok , " party leader filip dewinter -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters .
greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .
though officially bilingual , belgium ’ s population is divided regionally and linguistically into the northern flemish-speaking flanders , francophone walloon to the south and the capital of brussels as an independent region .
the result is that the country ’ s 10 million people have six governments : one federal , three regional , one francophone and one flemish .
the political parties are also organized along linguistic lines and obliged to form coalitions with each other to reach a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of the far-right vlaams blok -lrb- flemish bloc -rrb- filip dewinter , center , vlaams blok , which campaigns for zero tolerance on crime and takes a strong anti-immigrant line , has seen its support base spreading from urban strongholds into rural areas .
" this is a very important victory for the vlaams blok , " party leader filip dewinter -lrb- photo -rrb- told reuters .
greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .
though officially bilingual , belgium ’ s population is divided regionally and linguistically into the northern flemish-speaking flanders , francophone walloon to the south and the capital of brussels as an independent region .
the result is that the country ’ s 10 million people have six governments : one federal , three regional , one francophone and one flemish .

acebes added that the five interior ministers had agreed on setting up a working group to deal with illegal immigration and terrorism and to meet every three months to review progress .

al-qaeda signature on latest attacks ?
the meeting of eu interior ministers comes at the end of a week which saw a string of suicide bomb blasts kill 34 in saudi arabia and more recently 41 in morocco , injuring scores .
the attacks , which targeted locations populated by westerners , have been widely blamed on " international terrorists " with the u.s. suggesting that they bear the hallmarks of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network .
president bush issued a " wake-up call " to the world over the weekend , that while al-qaeda had been weakened by the u.s.-led war on terror it remained a threat .
both saudi arabia and morocco , arab kingdoms with historically close ties with washington , have said local terrorist groups " with international links " are responsible for the attacks .
on sunday , moroccan justice minister mohamed bouzoubaa suggested some of the 13 suicide bombers who carried out the carnage in casablanca , were members of a little-known local group , assirat al moustaquim which is sympathetic to al qaeda .
moroccan police rounded up 33 suspects on sunday , including some linked to the radical salafist jihad group .
saudi authorities said on sunday they were seriously probing al qaeda links to last monday ’ s bombings in the capital riyadh .
they also said they had detained four suspected al-qaeda members who they allege had prior knowledge of the suicide bombings .
german intelligence : al qaeda active again the theory that al qaeda could be behind the latest wave of suicides attacks has large support among security authorities in europe , who fear a resurgence of the network .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily said in a television interview sunday that he suspected al qaeda had a hand in the latest bombings .
" it ’ s highly likely , the hallmarks of the attacks in riyadh and casablanca all point towards it , " he said .
schily also urged a resolved effort to clamp down on terrorism .
" our only chance is not protection , we don ’ t have that many police anywhere in the world .
we must smash these networks and get intelligence in the best form we can . "
the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- also said in a report on sunday that the al qaeda group has regrouped itself and was once again financially in a position to carry out terrorist attacks simultaneously worldwide .
" support bases and recruiting potential in saudi arabia , as well as in yemen , united arab emirates and kuwait are intact , " the report said .
german intelligence officials also point out in the report that osama bin laden is still alive and lived on the outskirts of pakistan , though the network is now headed by new younger members .
the bnd has also warned that the terrorist network was planning attacks in afghanistan in particular against the multinational peacekeeping force , which includes 2,400 german soldiers .

interior ministers of the eu ’ s “ big five ” countries are meeting to review security amid a backdrop of devastating bombings and fears in europe that al qaeda activity is on the rise . interior ministers of germany , france , spain , great britain and italy are seeking ways to counter the danger posed by international terroris following recent attacks on the morrocan city of casablanca on friday night that killed dozens , including eight europeans .
in a two-day meeting near the southern spanish city of jerez on sunday , the ministers are discussing plans for intensifying cooperation against international terrorism and illegal immigration .
eu ministers sound alarm bells after the first day of talks on sunday , the ministers warned that dormant islamic terrorist cells could strike at any time .
" no one can say they are excluded or safe from an attempted attack by radical islamic terrorism and that is exactly why we have to reinforce all our security measures , " spanish interior minister angel acebes said .
acebes added that the five interior ministers had agreed on setting up a working group to deal with illegal immigration and terrorism and to meet every three months to review progress .
the minister said international cooperation in fighting terrorism was " absolutely indispensable " and " new instruments " within the european union shouldn ’ t just lead to better cooperation between police authorities , but also between justices as well as enable a common legislation .
pisanu said italy had identified 6,150 potential terrorists targets in his country and added that illegal immigration further complicated the task facing authorities .
an estimated 500,000 people pour into the 15-nation european union illegally each year .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy called the war against terror a " war that will be waged in the future . "
al-qaeda signature on latest attacks ?
the meeting of eu interior ministers comes at the end of a week which saw a string of suicide bomb blasts kill 34 in saudi arabia and more recently 41 in morocco , injuring scores .
the attacks , which targeted locations populated by westerners , have been widely blamed on " international terrorists " with the u.s. suggesting that they bear the hallmarks of osama bin laden ’ s al qaeda network .
president bush issued a " wake-up call " to the world over the weekend , that while al-qaeda had been weakened by the u.s.-led war on terror it remained a threat .
both saudi arabia and morocco , arab kingdoms with historically close ties with washington , have said local terrorist groups " with international links " are responsible for the attacks .
on sunday , moroccan justice minister mohamed bouzoubaa suggested some of the 13 suicide bombers who carried out the carnage in casablanca , were members of a little-known local group , assirat al moustaquim which is sympathetic to al qaeda .
moroccan police rounded up 33 suspects on sunday , including some linked to the radical salafist jihad group .
saudi authorities said on sunday they were seriously probing al qaeda links to last monday ’ s bombings in the capital riyadh .
they also said they had detained four suspected al-qaeda members who they allege had prior knowledge of the suicide bombings .
german intelligence : al qaeda active again the theory that al qaeda could be behind the latest wave of suicides attacks has large support among security authorities in europe , who fear a resurgence of the network .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily said in a television interview sunday that he suspected al qaeda had a hand in the latest bombings .
" it ’ s highly likely , the hallmarks of the attacks in riyadh and casablanca all point towards it , " he said .
schily also urged a resolved effort to clamp down on terrorism .
" our only chance is not protection , we don ’ t have that many police anywhere in the world .
we must smash these networks and get intelligence in the best form we can . "
the german foreign intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- also said in a report on sunday that the al qaeda group has regrouped itself and was once again financially in a position to carry out terrorist attacks simultaneously worldwide .
" support bases and recruiting potential in saudi arabia , as well as in yemen , united arab emirates and kuwait are intact , " the report said .
german intelligence officials also point out in the report that osama bin laden is still alive and lived on the outskirts of pakistan , though the network is now headed by new younger members .
the bnd has also warned that the terrorist network was planning attacks in afghanistan in particular against the multinational peacekeeping force , which includes 2,400 german soldiers .
western governments issue travel alerts the warnings about al qaeda ’ s possible activities come amid a wave of terror alerts issued by western governments , urging its citizens from travelling to the middle east and africa .
the german foreign ministry over the weekend advised german nationals against visiting east africa and morocco , and asked them to be on high alert if they were visiting uganda , ethiopia and eritrea .
in the past few days britain has banned flights by british airlines to kenya and warned its citizens that there is a " clear terrorist threat " in six neighboring east african countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moroccan islamists suspected in casablanca bombings twenty-nine people were killed and scores were injured in a series of five almost simultaneous bombings in the moroccan city of casablanca on friday night .

belgian prime minister verhofstadt is set to form a new center-left government after the ruling liberals and socialists registered a thumping win in polls that also produced huge gains for a far-right party . belgium ’ s liberals and socialists came up trumps in both the northern flemish-speaking flanders and francophone walloon in the south on sunday ’ s general election , despite the collapse of their coalition partner , the greens .
" voters have given us the mandate to continue our work of modernization and change in this country in the next few years , " verhofstadt , 50 , told cheering members of his flemish liberal party -lrb- vld -rrb- .
with unemployment high and economic growth sluggish , verhofstadt is focusing on fiscal reform and tax cuts .
he has also vowed to reform the judiciary and get tough on immigration .
verhofstadt , compared to harry potter on account of his round glasses , mop of ginger hair and boyish face , is credited with turning the mainly roman catholic belgium away from its conservative roots to become nearly as permissive as its dutch neighbor by legalizing gay marriage and euthanasia and decriminalizing cannabis .
the socialists made the biggest gains but fell just short of overtaking verhofstadt ’ s liberals as the largest party in the flemish-speaking northern flanders , which traditionally takes the initiative to form a new government .
latest projections by the vrt broadcasting network forecast the liberals and socialists would take 96 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament .
record gains for far-right the surprise of the election went to belgium ’ s far-right vlaams blok party , which has ties with french extreme-right leader jean-marie len pen .
the party increased its share of the vote to a record 17.9 percent in flanders from the 15.4 percent it won in 1999 .

greens flounder at polls however the electoral triumph will not see the far-right party enter a ruling coalition as all mainstream parties refuse to deal with the blok , branding it racist and xenophobic .
verhofstadt ’ s vld has ruled in a coalition with the socialists and the greens for the past four years .
but with the greens failing to clear the required 5 percent hurdle to be able to enter a coalition , the new belgian government could well consist of just two parties .
voters booted out the greens partly out of anger at their campaigning against arms exports to nepal , night flights over brussels and tobacco advertising , which cost belgium its formula one motor racing grand prix .
though officially bilingual , belgium ’ s population is divided regionally and linguistically into the northern flemish-speaking flanders , francophone walloon to the south and the capital of brussels as an independent region .

the environment minister michael meacher told the bbc a ban on gm crops would be illegal unless there is scientific proof that they harm people or the environment .
the latest polls show only 14 % of people in britain approve of gm food .
but mr meacher told bbc radio 4 's farming today that public opposition alone would not influence the government 's decision .
" we have to act in accordance with the law , " he said on monday .
" the law at the present moment is set down in an eu directive and the key and sole criteria for taking action with regard to gm crops is : are they a harm or risk to the environment ? "
' no evidence ' later this year the government will decide whether to license commercial gm crops .
scientists investigating the effects of gm crops on the government 's behalf have yet to find they cause harm .
two weeks ago , the royal society said there was no evidence eating gm foods was any different from eating naturally produced food .
a senior member of the society said the public had been frightened by " unsubstantiated claims " .
a widespread public consultation on the issue is due to begin in two weeks .
crops attacked on sunday , protesters cut down a gm crop in fife .
the rapeseed crop was the second in a week in scotland to be attacked .

but the organisation 's research shows people in northern ireland are the most generous when it comes to donating to charity .
the caf research , carried out ahead of a conference in glasgow on monday , shows that 30.5 % of households in scotland give to charity .
this compares with 28.7 % in england , 26.8 % in wales and 51.6 % in northern ireland .
average donation the caf is trying to help scottish charities to increase their voluntary income , by exploring what makes people in different areas of the country give donations .
the researchers found that almost a third of households in scotland give money to charity every week .
although more scots make the effort than those in england , the size of the average donation is slightly smaller .
their average donation is only £ 4.93 compared to £ 5.93 in england and £ 6.87 in northern ireland .
the foundation said charities would benefit more if donors moved away from the culture of giving what they can when they can , to more planned tax-effective giving , like direct debits and standing orders .
cathy pharoah , director of research at caf , said : " the smarter donors are about their giving to charity , the more money those charities will receive .
" currently the culture of giving in scotland is for donors to give what they can , when they can .
" if they were encouraged to use a variety of tax-effective giving methods , charities could potentially receive an extra £ 60m in voluntary income every year . "

american artist paul mccarthy has distorted the familiar pointy-nosed puppet-boy into a intimidating figure , which sits on a pile of books and has a cube for a head .
rising above the river thames , blockhead is situated outside london 's tate modern gallery and goes on show from monday .
visitors will be able to enter the installation through an opening in the base , and can buy specially-made sweets from inside the cavernous hallway .
mr mccarthy says it is like standing at the bottom of a cliff , describing blockhead as " an abstract that rises up and over your head " .
" this is one of the largest inflatable sculptures made , as far as i know , " a tate spokeswoman said .
as high as the tate " it 's the height of the tate modern building - not including the chimney .
" it 's a big surprise because it 's so huge .
i 've noticed lots of smiles creeping across people 's faces . "
alongside blockhead will be a second new work by the artist , entitled daddies bighead .
half the height of blockhead , the second piece is also inflatable and is based on a ketchup bottle .
tomato sauce is a continuing theme in the 58-year-old artist 's art .
he has used it to represent bodily fluids and often focuses on consumer culture .
in the 1970s , he was known for his performance art .

a survey by cardiff university claims that more than half of the british public wrongly believe that medical science opinion was split down the middle on the subject .
but in fact almost all scientific experts rejected the claim of a link between the measles , mumps and rubella -lrb- mmr -rrb- vaccine and autism , said the research .
the study was carried out after publicity given to concerns raised by dr andrew wakefield about the injection .
there were also allegations that it could be linked to inflammatory bowel disease , and led to vaccination rates falling .
researchers in cardiff have examined the way that the mmr vaccine was reported by print and broadcast media .
research questioning the safety of something that is widely used should be approached with caution researcher justin lewis staff at the school of journalism , media and cultural studies also looked at the public 's knowledge of these issues .
professor justin lewis , one of the authors of the survey , said : " the survey confirms that the news media play a key role in informing the way people understand issues such as the controversy around mmr .
dr andrew wakefield claimed the mmr vaccine could cause autism " while wakefield 's claims are of legitimate public interest , our report shows that research questioning the safety of something that is widely used should be approached with caution , both by scientists and journalists , " he said .
the report found that 53 % of those surveyed at the height of the media coverage assumed that because both sides of the debate received equal coverage , there must be equal evidence for each .
' minority voices ' it said only 23 % were aware that the bulk of evidence favoured supporters of the vaccine .
