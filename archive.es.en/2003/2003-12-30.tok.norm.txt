he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .

many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .

prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .

despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .

he shot to overnight fame with his novel " sophie 's world " .
more than 12 million people have read the story about a 14 year old who is fascinated by philosophy .
jostein , a qualified teacher , just wanted to write a book about the history of philosophy that was easy to understand and which could be read by children .
the huge success came as a surprise and now his books are published in ten different countries .
jostein gaarder lives in oslo with his wife and 2 sons .
how would you describe yourself ? " i 'm an enthusiastic person , you know .
i feel overwhelmed at being alive , at living in this enigmatic universe . "
his favourite music is gustav mahler 's symphony nr. 1 . his favorite book is " the magic mountain " by thomas mann .
his favourite food is salmon with cucumber salad .
what makes you happy and why ?
" when i 'm outside , in the open nature , open landscape .
when i leave the city .
i 'm not a very urban person .
the philosopher socrates said " i have to live in athens " because the trees in the countryside can not teach me anything .
i completely disagree .
i feel i can learn from the trees in the countryside , sometimes even more than from the human beings in the city . " what is your secret passion ?
" i became a grandfather one month ago .
not very many people know about that .
the little baby is living in our house , so it 's kind of a secret passion , a new thing for me to again have a tiny little baby in my arms again .
i put him here on my knees and then i play the piano for him .
that 's a secret passion . " who 's your personal hero ?
" heroes like mahatma gandhi , like martin luther king , like nelson mandela , and i think the world today needs heroes like that .
voices like that , visionary people like that . "
what qualities do you most admire in a friend ?
" that 's not behaving like a friend just because you can take some advantage of me in any sense .
being a friend not only when i 'm happy , but when i 'm sad .
knowing that we can see each other , even if one or two years may go by , but when we meet again we are friends . "
who deserves a big thank you ?
" i 'm 51 years old now .
i 've been married for 30 years , and of course , i 'm most grateful to my wife .
after all , we 've spent more than half of our lives together .
the person who has given me the most gifts would be her .
it might be a boring answer but that 's the truth . "
to whom do you owe an apology ?
" if i 've behaved arrogantly .
i do n't think i often do , but maybe sometimes i have behaved arrogant to a person .
that person i 'd really owe an apology to . " do you have an unfulfilled ambition ?
" i 'd love to compose music and maybe one day if i 'm bored of writing books i 'd want to do something very different .
i love music , so maybe i 'd like to work with music .
another thing is to quit smoking , which is so stupid .

he shot to overnight fame with his novel " sophie 's world " .
more than 12 million people have read the story about a 14 year old who is fascinated by philosophy .
jostein , a qualified teacher , just wanted to write a book about the history of philosophy that was easy to understand and which could be read by children .
the huge success came as a surprise and now his books are published in ten different countries .
jostein gaarder lives in oslo with his wife and 2 sons .
how would you describe yourself ? " i 'm an enthusiastic person , you know .
i feel overwhelmed at being alive , at living in this enigmatic universe . "
his favourite music is gustav mahler 's symphony nr. 1 . his favorite book is " the magic mountain " by thomas mann .
his favourite food is salmon with cucumber salad .
what makes you happy and why ?
" when i 'm outside , in the open nature , open landscape .
when i leave the city .
i 'm not a very urban person .
the philosopher socrates said " i have to live in athens " because the trees in the countryside can not teach me anything .
i completely disagree .
i feel i can learn from the trees in the countryside , sometimes even more than from the human beings in the city . " what is your secret passion ?
" i became a grandfather one month ago .
not very many people know about that .
the little baby is living in our house , so it 's kind of a secret passion , a new thing for me to again have a tiny little baby in my arms again .
i put him here on my knees and then i play the piano for him .
that 's a secret passion . " who 's your personal hero ?
" heroes like mahatma gandhi , like martin luther king , like nelson mandela , and i think the world today needs heroes like that .
voices like that , visionary people like that . "
what qualities do you most admire in a friend ?
" that 's not behaving like a friend just because you can take some advantage of me in any sense .
being a friend not only when i 'm happy , but when i 'm sad .
knowing that we can see each other , even if one or two years may go by , but when we meet again we are friends . "
who deserves a big thank you ?
" i 'm 51 years old now .
i 've been married for 30 years , and of course , i 'm most grateful to my wife .
after all , we 've spent more than half of our lives together .
the person who has given me the most gifts would be her .
it might be a boring answer but that 's the truth . "
to whom do you owe an apology ?
" if i 've behaved arrogantly .
i do n't think i often do , but maybe sometimes i have behaved arrogant to a person .
that person i 'd really owe an apology to . " do you have an unfulfilled ambition ?
" i 'd love to compose music and maybe one day if i 'm bored of writing books i 'd want to do something very different .
i love music , so maybe i 'd like to work with music .
another thing is to quit smoking , which is so stupid .

he shot to overnight fame with his novel " sophie 's world " .
more than 12 million people have read the story about a 14 year old who is fascinated by philosophy .
jostein , a qualified teacher , just wanted to write a book about the history of philosophy that was easy to understand and which could be read by children .
the huge success came as a surprise and now his books are published in ten different countries .
jostein gaarder lives in oslo with his wife and 2 sons .
how would you describe yourself ? " i 'm an enthusiastic person , you know .
i feel overwhelmed at being alive , at living in this enigmatic universe . "
his favourite music is gustav mahler 's symphony nr. 1 . his favorite book is " the magic mountain " by thomas mann .
his favourite food is salmon with cucumber salad .
what makes you happy and why ?
" when i 'm outside , in the open nature , open landscape .
when i leave the city .
i 'm not a very urban person .
the philosopher socrates said " i have to live in athens " because the trees in the countryside can not teach me anything .
i completely disagree .
i feel i can learn from the trees in the countryside , sometimes even more than from the human beings in the city . " what is your secret passion ?
" i became a grandfather one month ago .
not very many people know about that .
the little baby is living in our house , so it 's kind of a secret passion , a new thing for me to again have a tiny little baby in my arms again .
i put him here on my knees and then i play the piano for him .
that 's a secret passion . " who 's your personal hero ?
" heroes like mahatma gandhi , like martin luther king , like nelson mandela , and i think the world today needs heroes like that .
voices like that , visionary people like that . "
what qualities do you most admire in a friend ?
" that 's not behaving like a friend just because you can take some advantage of me in any sense .
being a friend not only when i 'm happy , but when i 'm sad .
knowing that we can see each other , even if one or two years may go by , but when we meet again we are friends . "
who deserves a big thank you ?
" i 'm 51 years old now .
i 've been married for 30 years , and of course , i 'm most grateful to my wife .
after all , we 've spent more than half of our lives together .
the person who has given me the most gifts would be her .
it might be a boring answer but that 's the truth . "
to whom do you owe an apology ?
" if i 've behaved arrogantly .
i do n't think i often do , but maybe sometimes i have behaved arrogant to a person .
that person i 'd really owe an apology to . " do you have an unfulfilled ambition ?
" i 'd love to compose music and maybe one day if i 'm bored of writing books i 'd want to do something very different .
i love music , so maybe i 'd like to work with music .
another thing is to quit smoking , which is so stupid .
it 's the one thing i 'm most ashamed of in my life because it 's so stupid . " what do you treasure most ?
" i had the opportunity to buy a very nice house and that must be the most important posession .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .
“ so in that sense the conference did have a positive outcome . ”

that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .
and now , six months later , nothing had happened yet on that . “ regretfully , i have to say that you not only didn ’ t do your homework , but you ’ ve failed totally , ” schulz said . that time berlusconi said nothing . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .

" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .

for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .

prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.12.2003 2004 expected to be a tough year for eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern will have his hands full as eu president in 2004 .
as the eu expands from 15 to 25 members in may , unity will become more difficult .
already there is substantial dissent from the founding members of the bloc . even before taking over the eu presidency on january 1 , irish prime minister bertie ahern is trying to temper expectations .
he considers a quick attempt to reach an agreement on an eu constitution unrealistic .
europeans are simply too divided .
and in any case , nothing on this front will happen before the march parliamentary elections in spain , which rejected the proposed constitution . instead of resolving the fight , ahern will have his hands full attempting to keep the divisions within the eu from growing deeper .
in may , the eu will expand from 15 to 25 members . in the weeks following the rejection of a proposed eu constitution , there have been suggestions about ways some long-time eu members might be grouped together to gain power within the eu as a whole . ahern opposes idea of ' core europe ' ahern said he opposes the idea of a two-speed europe .
nonetheless , the first meeting of the so-called core european countries - france , germany and other founding members of the eu - could take place in the coming weeks .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker is apparently already preparing plans for this . the first indications of a counter-movement came just hours after the failed constitutional summit in brussels .
six of the 10 top eu countries let it be known that they were not prepared to pump more money into the eu .
now countries that have received money will have to give money to the new members from eastern europe . the already hotly debated financial dealings are being mixed with the power questions brought up in discussions of the constitution .
in 2004 , this will provide a strong test of the european will and ability to integrate . new eu commission president to be chosen the divided heads of state must choose a new eu commission president who will then lead an eu government with 25 commissioners - one for every member state .
juncker is a controversial candidate as he has provoked anger from italy and many of the smaller member states that were n't part of the group that founded the eu . at the end of the year , the eu faces a decision on whether turkey will be taken on as a candidate for membership .
in light of the institutional and financial difficulties the eu is already struggling with , this topic is expected to be divisive . the next year will also present challenges to the effort at creating a unified european foreign policy .
the common foreign minister envisioned by the constitution wo n't exist in the foreseeable future . at the end of 2004 the stability pact dealing with the euro will be up for discussion again .
after germany and france blatently violated its budgetary guidelines and got away with little more than a slap on the wrist , several smaller eu members have called for stricter enforcement of the pact , especially in light of enlargement . the eu , which is approaching its 50th birthday , has already survived many crises .
and the growing union is not about to fall apart .
but 2004 will be a difficult year for testing the bloc 's unity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for euope , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

the mood among german business is picking up on the coattails of the improved economic situtation in the u.s. but germans are unlikely to have more jobs as a result , a survey shows . if the signs on the horizon are to be believed , germany 's economy could be on the cusp of recovery going into 2004 , according to a survey of 43 business groups .
stressing the positive , the iw economic institute said the signals for improvement in the german economy are unmistakable , with 25 of the 43 business groups questioned saying they plan to increase production going into 2004 .
only five of the groups said the outlook was worse than a year ago , and 13 said the situation was unchanged .
however , the improved mood is unlikely to create more jobs .
" a small majority of industry groups expect a further drop in the number of people employed " in germany , the cologne-based institute said .
" this applies particularly to industries whose activities are focused on domestic customers . "
hiring in plastics german companies have been reluctant to hire new employees as the economy stagnated for a third year , with unemployment reaching 4.46 million in april 2003 , the highest in more than five years .
twenty industries said they expect germany 's employment level to remain unchanged in 2004 , according to the iw institute .
the survey said the only group planning to hire more people next year was the association representing plastics processors .
the ifo economic institute also said it expects unemployment to drop to 4.3 million next year .
it forecasts economic expansion of 1.8 percent amid an export-led recovery .
the iw survey 's slightly upbeat production and revenue forecasts are due to signs of recovery in the world economic situation , especially in the u.s , iw spokesman gerhard fels said .
" that will help our exports , although these will naturally be damped by the strong euro . "
guarded outlook nonetheless , business groups remain guarded in their outlooks , fels notes .
for economic improvement to really take hold in the long term , there must be an increase in investment .
" the tendency of investors is getting livelier .
we 'll see an upswing in factory and production tools .
on the other hand , the construction industry remains the problem child of the german economy , but we have n't hit bottom yet , " fels said .
among those german companies forecasting global recovery next year are basf , the world 's largest chemical maker , carmaker bmw and deutsche post , a survey by bloomberg news service said .
nineteen of 21 companies that responded to an annual bloomberg questionnaire expect a faster pace of global expansion next year .
fifteen mentioned the u.s. as a driver of growth and 10 named china .
the companies have combined annual sales of about 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 500 billion -rrb- .
" in the u.s. , we see that production and demand are rising , " said hero brahms , chief financial officer of linde ag , europe 's largest maker of forklifts , in a written response to the survey .
" increasing demand in southeast asia , especially in china , is particularly pleasing . "
consumer confidence stagnant meanwhile , reuters news service said german consumer confidence is stagnating , as concern about government tax-cut proposals prompted shoppers to rein in expectations of economic recovery and rising incomes .

the mood among german business is picking up on the coattails of the improved economic situtation in the u.s. but germans are unlikely to have more jobs as a result , a survey shows . if the signs on the horizon are to be believed , germany 's economy could be on the cusp of recovery going into 2004 , according to a survey of 43 business groups .
stressing the positive , the iw economic institute said the signals for improvement in the german economy are unmistakable , with 25 of the 43 business groups questioned saying they plan to increase production going into 2004 .
only five of the groups said the outlook was worse than a year ago , and 13 said the situation was unchanged .
however , the improved mood is unlikely to create more jobs .
" a small majority of industry groups expect a further drop in the number of people employed " in germany , the cologne-based institute said .
" this applies particularly to industries whose activities are focused on domestic customers . "
hiring in plastics german companies have been reluctant to hire new employees as the economy stagnated for a third year , with unemployment reaching 4.46 million in april 2003 , the highest in more than five years .
twenty industries said they expect germany 's employment level to remain unchanged in 2004 , according to the iw institute .
the survey said the only group planning to hire more people next year was the association representing plastics processors .
the ifo economic institute also said it expects unemployment to drop to 4.3 million next year .
it forecasts economic expansion of 1.8 percent amid an export-led recovery .
the iw survey 's slightly upbeat production and revenue forecasts are due to signs of recovery in the world economic situation , especially in the u.s , iw spokesman gerhard fels said .
" that will help our exports , although these will naturally be damped by the strong euro . "
guarded outlook nonetheless , business groups remain guarded in their outlooks , fels notes .
for economic improvement to really take hold in the long term , there must be an increase in investment .
" the tendency of investors is getting livelier .
we 'll see an upswing in factory and production tools .
on the other hand , the construction industry remains the problem child of the german economy , but we have n't hit bottom yet , " fels said .
among those german companies forecasting global recovery next year are basf , the world 's largest chemical maker , carmaker bmw and deutsche post , a survey by bloomberg news service said .
nineteen of 21 companies that responded to an annual bloomberg questionnaire expect a faster pace of global expansion next year .
fifteen mentioned the u.s. as a driver of growth and 10 named china .
the companies have combined annual sales of about 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 500 billion -rrb- .
" in the u.s. , we see that production and demand are rising , " said hero brahms , chief financial officer of linde ag , europe 's largest maker of forklifts , in a written response to the survey .
" increasing demand in southeast asia , especially in china , is particularly pleasing . "
consumer confidence stagnant meanwhile , reuters news service said german consumer confidence is stagnating , as concern about government tax-cut proposals prompted shoppers to rein in expectations of economic recovery and rising incomes .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .

based on the year through october , the statistics office says exports for 2003 were valued at € 664 billion , news wires reported .
imports were also up 2 percent from a year earlier , at € 529 billion .

the mood among german business is picking up on the coattails of the improved economic situtation in the u.s. but germans are unlikely to have more jobs as a result , a survey shows . if the signs on the horizon are to be believed , germany 's economy could be on the cusp of recovery going into 2004 , according to a survey of 43 business groups .
stressing the positive , the iw economic institute said the signals for improvement in the german economy are unmistakable , with 25 of the 43 business groups questioned saying they plan to increase production going into 2004 .
only five of the groups said the outlook was worse than a year ago , and 13 said the situation was unchanged .
however , the improved mood is unlikely to create more jobs .
" a small majority of industry groups expect a further drop in the number of people employed " in germany , the cologne-based institute said .
" this applies particularly to industries whose activities are focused on domestic customers . "
hiring in plastics german companies have been reluctant to hire new employees as the economy stagnated for a third year , with unemployment reaching 4.46 million in april 2003 , the highest in more than five years .
twenty industries said they expect germany 's employment level to remain unchanged in 2004 , according to the iw institute .
the survey said the only group planning to hire more people next year was the association representing plastics processors .
the ifo economic institute also said it expects unemployment to drop to 4.3 million next year .
it forecasts economic expansion of 1.8 percent amid an export-led recovery .
the iw survey 's slightly upbeat production and revenue forecasts are due to signs of recovery in the world economic situation , especially in the u.s , iw spokesman gerhard fels said .
" that will help our exports , although these will naturally be damped by the strong euro . "
guarded outlook nonetheless , business groups remain guarded in their outlooks , fels notes .
for economic improvement to really take hold in the long term , there must be an increase in investment .
" the tendency of investors is getting livelier .
we 'll see an upswing in factory and production tools .
on the other hand , the construction industry remains the problem child of the german economy , but we have n't hit bottom yet , " fels said .
among those german companies forecasting global recovery next year are basf , the world 's largest chemical maker , carmaker bmw and deutsche post , a survey by bloomberg news service said .
nineteen of 21 companies that responded to an annual bloomberg questionnaire expect a faster pace of global expansion next year .
fifteen mentioned the u.s. as a driver of growth and 10 named china .
the companies have combined annual sales of about 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 500 billion -rrb- .
" in the u.s. , we see that production and demand are rising , " said hero brahms , chief financial officer of linde ag , europe 's largest maker of forklifts , in a written response to the survey .
" increasing demand in southeast asia , especially in china , is particularly pleasing . "

the report was based on a study by the society for reactor security that was commissioned by environment minister jürgen trittin after the september 11 terror attack in new york .
it found that a catastrophe like that in chernobyl could possibly follow an airplane crash into one of the reactors .
the study said it would be unrealistic to try to strengthen the power plants themselves , and instead recommended the construction of objects outside the plants that would make it impossible for terrorists to fly planes into them . more briefs 30.12.2003 -pipe- berlin senators dispute university budget cuts 29.12.2003 -pipe- more children living in poverty 29.12.2003 -pipe- doctor shortage in germany called acute 29.12.2003 -pipe- schröder calls for new culture of innovation 27.12.2003 -pipe- interior minister tried to hinder release of sep .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .

that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .
and now , six months later , nothing had happened yet on that . “ regretfully , i have to say that you not only didn ’ t do your homework , but you ’ ve failed totally , ” schulz said . that time berlusconi said nothing . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .
“ so in that sense the conference did have a positive outcome . ”

that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .
and now , six months later , nothing had happened yet on that . “ regretfully , i have to say that you not only didn ’ t do your homework , but you ’ ve failed totally , ” schulz said . that time berlusconi said nothing . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .

that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .
“ so in that sense the conference did have a positive outcome . ”
diplomats who took part in the negotiations dispute this . a glorious presidency ? right after the summit , the italian president declared his presidency to have been one of the most glorious of recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president roman prodi , left , and berlusconi during negotiations for a new eu consititution .
that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .
and now , six months later , nothing had happened yet on that . “ regretfully , i have to say that you not only didn ’ t do your homework , but you ’ ve failed totally , ” schulz said . that time berlusconi said nothing . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .
“ so in that sense the conference did have a positive outcome . ”
diplomats who took part in the negotiations dispute this . a glorious presidency ? right after the summit , the italian president declared his presidency to have been one of the most glorious of recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president roman prodi , left , and berlusconi during negotiations for a new eu consititution .
that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .
and now , six months later , nothing had happened yet on that . “ regretfully , i have to say that you not only didn ’ t do your homework , but you ’ ve failed totally , ” schulz said . that time berlusconi said nothing . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .
“ so in that sense the conference did have a positive outcome . ”
diplomats who took part in the negotiations dispute this . a glorious presidency ? right after the summit , the italian president declared his presidency to have been one of the most glorious of recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president roman prodi , left , and berlusconi during negotiations for a new eu consititution .
that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .
and now , six months later , nothing had happened yet on that . “ regretfully , i have to say that you not only didn ’ t do your homework , but you ’ ve failed totally , ” schulz said . that time berlusconi said nothing . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.12.2003 2004 expected to be a tough year for eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish prime minister bertie ahern will have his hands full as eu president in 2004 .
as the eu expands from 15 to 25 members in may , unity will become more difficult .
already there is substantial dissent from the founding members of the bloc . even before taking over the eu presidency on january 1 , irish prime minister bertie ahern is trying to temper expectations .
he considers a quick attempt to reach an agreement on an eu constitution unrealistic .
europeans are simply too divided .
and in any case , nothing on this front will happen before the march parliamentary elections in spain , which rejected the proposed constitution . instead of resolving the fight , ahern will have his hands full attempting to keep the divisions within the eu from growing deeper .
in may , the eu will expand from 15 to 25 members . in the weeks following the rejection of a proposed eu constitution , there have been suggestions about ways some long-time eu members might be grouped together to gain power within the eu as a whole . ahern opposes idea of ' core europe ' ahern said he opposes the idea of a two-speed europe .
nonetheless , the first meeting of the so-called core european countries - france , germany and other founding members of the eu - could take place in the coming weeks .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker is apparently already preparing plans for this . the first indications of a counter-movement came just hours after the failed constitutional summit in brussels .
six of the 10 top eu countries let it be known that they were not prepared to pump more money into the eu .
now countries that have received money will have to give money to the new members from eastern europe . the already hotly debated financial dealings are being mixed with the power questions brought up in discussions of the constitution .
in 2004 , this will provide a strong test of the european will and ability to integrate . new eu commission president to be chosen the divided heads of state must choose a new eu commission president who will then lead an eu government with 25 commissioners - one for every member state .
juncker is a controversial candidate as he has provoked anger from italy and many of the smaller member states that were n't part of the group that founded the eu . at the end of the year , the eu faces a decision on whether turkey will be taken on as a candidate for membership .
in light of the institutional and financial difficulties the eu is already struggling with , this topic is expected to be divisive . the next year will also present challenges to the effort at creating a unified european foreign policy .
the common foreign minister envisioned by the constitution wo n't exist in the foreseeable future . at the end of 2004 the stability pact dealing with the euro will be up for discussion again .
after germany and france blatently violated its budgetary guidelines and got away with little more than a slap on the wrist , several smaller eu members have called for stricter enforcement of the pact , especially in light of enlargement . the eu , which is approaching its 50th birthday , has already survived many crises .
and the growing union is not about to fall apart .
but 2004 will be a difficult year for testing the bloc 's unity . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for euope , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .
“ so in that sense the conference did have a positive outcome . ”
diplomats who took part in the negotiations dispute this . a glorious presidency ? right after the summit , the italian president declared his presidency to have been one of the most glorious of recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president roman prodi , left , and berlusconi during negotiations for a new eu consititution .
that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .
and now , six months later , nothing had happened yet on that . “ regretfully , i have to say that you not only didn ’ t do your homework , but you ’ ve failed totally , ” schulz said . that time berlusconi said nothing . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

as the eu expands from 15 to 25 members in may , unity will become more difficult .
already there is substantial dissent from the founding members of the bloc . even before taking over the eu presidency on january 1 , irish prime minister bertie ahern is trying to temper expectations .
he considers a quick attempt to reach an agreement on an eu constitution unrealistic .
europeans are simply too divided .
and in any case , nothing on this front will happen before the march parliamentary elections in spain , which rejected the proposed constitution . instead of resolving the fight , ahern will have his hands full attempting to keep the divisions within the eu from growing deeper .
in may , the eu will expand from 15 to 25 members . in the weeks following the rejection of a proposed eu constitution , there have been suggestions about ways some long-time eu members might be grouped together to gain power within the eu as a whole . ahern opposes idea of ' core europe ' ahern said he opposes the idea of a two-speed europe .
nonetheless , the first meeting of the so-called core european countries - france , germany and other founding members of the eu - could take place in the coming weeks .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker is apparently already preparing plans for this . the first indications of a counter-movement came just hours after the failed constitutional summit in brussels .
six of the 10 top eu countries let it be known that they were not prepared to pump more money into the eu .
now countries that have received money will have to give money to the new members from eastern europe . the already hotly debated financial dealings are being mixed with the power questions brought up in discussions of the constitution .
in 2004 , this will provide a strong test of the european will and ability to integrate . new eu commission president to be chosen the divided heads of state must choose a new eu commission president who will then lead an eu government with 25 commissioners - one for every member state .
juncker is a controversial candidate as he has provoked anger from italy and many of the smaller member states that were n't part of the group that founded the eu . at the end of the year , the eu faces a decision on whether turkey will be taken on as a candidate for membership .
in light of the institutional and financial difficulties the eu is already struggling with , this topic is expected to be divisive . the next year will also present challenges to the effort at creating a unified european foreign policy .
the common foreign minister envisioned by the constitution wo n't exist in the foreseeable future . at the end of 2004 the stability pact dealing with the euro will be up for discussion again .
after germany and france blatently violated its budgetary guidelines and got away with little more than a slap on the wrist , several smaller eu members have called for stricter enforcement of the pact , especially in light of enlargement . the eu , which is approaching its 50th birthday , has already survived many crises .

he is likely to be remembered longer than his predecessors : not for scarce political successes but rather his flamboyant personality . european union officials had mixed feelings last july when berlusconi took over the eu council presidency , an agenda setting role that rotates among member states every six months .
as a multi-billionaire media mogul , berlusconi controls most of italy ’ s television and has frequently been known to push for legislation to serve his personal needs . while managing to evade charges of forging balance sheets , illegal campaign financing , tax fraud and bribing , he called italian judges “ red robes ” and accused them of planning to overthrow his government . a nazi comparison for starters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi talks before the european parliament in strasbourg .
at least one eu parliamentarian got a dose of classic berlusconi when the italian made his inaugural visit to the eu legislature .
he attacked the german social democrat member , martin schulz , after schulz had sharply criticized the conservative prime minister . “ mr. schulz , i know there is in italy a man producing a film on the nazi concentration camps , " he said .
" i ’ d like to suggest you for the role of guard .
you ’ d be perfect . " the two men later exchanged apologies , but it was difficult navigation for the italian presidency from then on .
for one , german chancellor gerhard schröder was annoyed at berlusconi and lost no opportunity to make his thoughts known . “ in both content and form this -lrb- nazi -rrb- comparison is a derailment , ” he said in germany ’ s parliament , the bundestag , and demanded an apology from his italian counterpart . soon thereafter , italy ’ s tourism minister insulted german holidaymakers in italy and schröder responded by cancelling his own tuscan holiday , boosting his popularity ratings at home . failing to broker a new eu constitution in terms of his work at the helm of the eu , berlusconi 's presidency was overshadowed by the failure to negotiate an eu constitution .
many delegations in brussels said that berlusconi ’ s chaotic management during the talks contributed considerably to the summit ’ s falling apart . berlusconi on the other hand didn ’ t consider the summit a complete failure . “ we have actually reached agreement on 82 contentious points where it seemed almost ruled out , ” he said .
“ so in that sense the conference did have a positive outcome . ”
diplomats who took part in the negotiations dispute this . a glorious presidency ? right after the summit , the italian president declared his presidency to have been one of the most glorious of recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president roman prodi , left , and berlusconi during negotiations for a new eu consititution .
that ’ s been called into question most vocally by the president of the european commission , romano prodi , a fellow italian who was locked with berlusconi in a covert election campaign because he intends to head the left 's candidacy against the prime minister in the next italian election .
prodi said that of the 13 big goals set out for the italian presidency , only five were implemented . the most important initiative during the last half a year was the economic program called " quickstart " which is designed to push a number of infrastructure projects costing billions , prodi said . berlusconi lists as a success the establishment of a european border protection agency and the distribution of new european authorities to ten member states .
he satisfied a personal wish by fetching the agency for food safety to parma .
his argument was that there are so many good restaurants in the town famous for its seasoned , salt-cured and air-dried hams . the italians didn ’ t facilitate progress on another major matter : eu member states still can ’ t agree on a structured immigration and refugee policy .
despite his earlier confrontation with berlusconi , germany ’ s martin schulz stirred things up again in july when he had accused the italian of preventing the introduction of a europe-wide arrest warrant out of his own interest .
and now , six months later , nothing had happened yet on that . “ regretfully , i have to say that you not only didn ’ t do your homework , but you ’ ve failed totally , ” schulz said . that time berlusconi said nothing . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi in europe 's hot seat following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .

the double star mission - which involves two spacecraft - is the first joint project between china and the european space agency .
the first spacecraft blasted off early on tuesday aboard a chinese long march 2c / sm rocket from a base in the town of xichang in south-west china .
the second will be launched in about six months ' time .
the spacecraft will study how the magnetised and charged particles streaming off the sun affect earth .
in extreme cases , this ejected material can interfere with communications and power lines , and even damage electronic components on orbiting satellites increased returns the joint venture sees china provide the launch rockets and the chassis for each spacecraft , and a number of instruments .
europe is spending 8m euros -lrb- £ 5.6m -rrb- on complimentary scientific instruments and a contribution to the network of data systems on the ground .
seven of the instruments on double star will actually be identical to those currently flying on the four cluster spacecraft put in orbit in 2000 by the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- to study the earth 's magnetosphere .
conducting joint studies with similar instruments on cluster and double star should increase the overall scientific return from both missions , researchers believe .
the term magnetosphere refers to the region around the planet which is protected by the earth 's magnetic field from the radiation and matter ejected by the sun .
this huge , tadpole-shaped region of space extends to about 60,000 kilometres from the earth , and the orbits of both cluster and the double star duo are designed to clip its boundary .
coordinated ' dance ' though seemingly remote , there are a lot of processes going on in and around the magnetosphere that have direct consequences on earth .
the arrival of huge clouds of magnetised and charged particles at the earth buffet and reconfigure the magnetosphere .
the interaction can give rise to the beautiful aurorae - the northern and southern lights - but it can also lead to communications disruption , power-line failures and even satellite damage .
the magnetosphere also helps reduce some of the more harmful - in health terms - cosmic radiation from reaching the earth 's surface .
the double star duo will sit thousands of kilometres apart from each other in space .
one spacecraft will fly in a polar orbit and the other close to earth 's equator .
but it will be possible to synchronise these orbits with those of the four cluster satellites so that all six spacecraft can study near-earth space together to give the most detailed , multi-dimensional view of the complex magnetosphere ever obtained .
" on its own , double star would be scientifically important because it will provide new measurements in key regions of magnetosphere , " said andrew fazakerley from university college london and one of the principal scientific investigators from the uk .
" for example , it will provide important new information on the earth 's changing radiation belts .
" however , the really exciting part is that the orbits of the two spacecraft are explicitly designed for co-ordinated measurements with cluster .
" so , when cluster is in the distant magnetic tail and double star is in the near tail , we shall be able to see simultaneously for the first time what happens in both of these key regions when the huge amounts of energy that drive the aurora are released . "

sir magdi yacoub is one of the world 's leading heart surgeons .
he works at the national heart and lung institute , part of imperial college london , but was born in the north of egypt .
i always wanted to be a surgeon , because i had a lot of admiration for my father , who is also a surgeon .
i also wanted to be a heart surgeon .
that was motivated by the fact that my young aunt , a sister of my dad , died in her early 20s of a correctable heart disease .
science and medicine stand up for all mankind - with the emphasis on all heart surgery was in its infancy , but i had heard about great surgeons in different countries , including britain .
i 'd heard about particular ones who i 'd targeted and wanted to go and work with and learn from them .
i could n't have done what i have done if i had stayed in egypt , for the simple fact that heart surgery was not developed in egypt , and the kind of studies i wanted to pursue were not available there .
i go back regularly now , to work with my colleagues there .
i have a charity called the chain of hope , where we target children from poor areas where heart surgery is not available , and we offer our services .
we also offer exchanges of ideas - not only in egypt but in different countries around the world - but egypt is obviously a very special place to me .
when i was a child , i have all these fond memories of these places - especially places like aswan , in the south of egypt , which is totally inspirational .
it has a special atmosphere and special history , and is also very near to other african countries .
certain tribes come from nowhere almost , and descend on the city - tall , handsome people .
you can imagine how a young boy would react to something like that .
it 's really beautiful , inspirational .
leaving egypt and the people i loved so much , and the environment i liked , was definitely worth it , because i also have great love for medicine and science .

sir magdi yacoub is one of the world 's leading heart surgeons .
he works at the national heart and lung institute , part of imperial college london , but was born in the north of egypt .
i always wanted to be a surgeon , because i had a lot of admiration for my father , who is also a surgeon .
i also wanted to be a heart surgeon .
that was motivated by the fact that my young aunt , a sister of my dad , died in her early 20s of a correctable heart disease .
science and medicine stand up for all mankind - with the emphasis on all heart surgery was in its infancy , but i had heard about great surgeons in different countries , including britain .
i 'd heard about particular ones who i 'd targeted and wanted to go and work with and learn from them .
i could n't have done what i have done if i had stayed in egypt , for the simple fact that heart surgery was not developed in egypt , and the kind of studies i wanted to pursue were not available there .
i go back regularly now , to work with my colleagues there .
i have a charity called the chain of hope , where we target children from poor areas where heart surgery is not available , and we offer our services .
we also offer exchanges of ideas - not only in egypt but in different countries around the world - but egypt is obviously a very special place to me .
when i was a child , i have all these fond memories of these places - especially places like aswan , in the south of egypt , which is totally inspirational .
it has a special atmosphere and special history , and is also very near to other african countries .
certain tribes come from nowhere almost , and descend on the city - tall , handsome people .
you can imagine how a young boy would react to something like that .
it 's really beautiful , inspirational .
leaving egypt and the people i loved so much , and the environment i liked , was definitely worth it , because i also have great love for medicine and science .

the british medical association hopes the new package will go some way to resolving the current recruitment crisis , by making wales a more attractive place to work for doctors .

famous berlusconi quotations the eu uses a time-share system for its common institutions .
it allows a different driver to take the wheel of the machine every six months , with each member-state taking turns to hold the eu presidency and chair its meetings .
mr berlusconi , italy 's debonair and super-rich prime minister , drove the eu 's ageing machine badly - some say recklessly - over rough terrain during the past half-year .
flashing his trademark smile , he declared during the brussels summit in mid-december that his period as leader of the eu had been a " triumph " .
but the next day the 25 eu leaders left amid talk of " catastrophe " and " crisis " .
secret formula ?
the talks broke down when mr berlusconi , their chairman , admitted that he had failed to find a basis for agreement on the historic task at hand , accepting the text of a future eu constitution .
a fiasco but not a disaster eu external affairs commissioner chris patten on the brussels summit none of the other leaders blamed mr berlusconi in public , but among themselves many were fuming .
one participant said it was the worst-prepared summit that anyone could remember .
chris patten , the european commissioner in charge of external affairs , says the best gloss that can be put on the brussels failure is that it was " a fiasco but not a disaster " .
but the abiding memories of the summit are negative for mr berlusconi .
he spoke breezily at the start of having a secret formula to bridge the dispute between rival groups -lrb- with poland and spain on one side , and france and germany on the other -rrb- over the voting rights of different eu states .
football and women in the event italy offered only a re-hash of old ideas as the basis of a compromise .
all silvio berlusconi had up his sleeve was a gelato-stained napkin with a few bad jokes scribbled on it mep graham watson as the eu leaders glumly sat around a big table in silence , mr berlusconi jokily suggested that they should talk about lighter topics , such as " football and women " .
the eu 's collective heart sank .
later a prominent member of the european parliament , graham watson , had a dig at mr berlusconi , saying that all he had up his sleeve was " a gelato-stained napkin with a few bad jokes scribbled on it " .
mr berlusconi is an unconventional kind of leader , a business tycoon-turned-politician who came to power promising to energise italy as he had his own business empire .
virtually his only training in high-wire international politics was his first , abortive stint as italy 's prime minister , which lasted less than a year in 1994 .
he came back to power two years ago .
his political opponents accuse him of misusing his political power to protect his own interests , by enacting laws to provide himself with immunity from prosecution in a high-profile corruption trial .
crashes and collisions already before taking over the eu presidency mr berlusconi had committed several big political gaffes , such as publicly claiming that european civilisation was " superior " to that of islam .
he later apologised .
mr berlusconi 's six months at the wheel of the eu were marked by more crashes and collisions : in july , on his second day in the eu driver 's seat , mr berlusconi had a diplomatic collision with germany .
he insulted a german member of the european parliament , saying he should play the role of a nazi concentration camp guard in a movie .
he claimed to have been misunderstood .
in october he ignored the eu 's agreed policies at an eu-russia summit meeting held after the arrest of top executives of the yukos oil firm .
mr berlusconi failed to remind the russian government to abide by the rule of law .
instead he declared president putin to be in the right , and joked that he was now mr putin 's " defence lawyer " .
the european commission later said mr berlusconi had not expressed eu policy .
as italy 's own deadline to reach accord on the eu constitutional talks came closer mr berlusconi himself went missing .
scheduled eu summits with canada and india were called off because the italian premier was indisposed .
major service due then came the brussels summit fiasco .
after a gruelling six months for the passengers in the other eu member-states , the italian premier has taken back the eu 's hire car to the shop .
its political mechanics are checking for dents and punctures , and they have diagnosed major engine trouble .
the next temporary owner , the irish government , will keep the car in the garage for an intensive service , before taking the eu vehicle out for a drive , to see if it is roadworthy again .
italy 's leader has got away with no official police points on his licence , but a reputation for careless driving .

anyone trying to buy more than two items at once from the louis vuitton mega-boutique on the champs elysees these days faces disappointment .
the restriction is the firm 's attempt to keep bulk buyers at bay - the people flying in from the far east to take advantage of the fact that luxury goods carry a much higher price ticket in japan or china than they do in the west .
the difference is high enough to keep an informal trade in parallel imports thriving .
over there the divergence in price of the same goods between different markets can be explained by the higher costs of doing business .
partly it is rental costs , import duties and the lack of storage space in cities like tokyo which pushes the price up in north east asia .
but more importantly , the high level of local demand in such markets allows the luxury goods to be sold for a higher price .
in fact , says morgan stanley retail specialist claire kent , the difference in price has actually fallen since the 1980s , when the same item was sometimes three times more expensive in japan during that country 's boom years .
the price differential has decreased as local markets have become increasingly comparable in their standard of living and as transportation costs have fallen .
restrictions are tight at the flagship store today , a 40 % premium is the norm for most european luxury goods in asia .
for example , the port tresor wallet - which sells for about 75,000 yen -lrb- $ 700 ; £ 400 -rrb- in the official louis vuitton store in tokyo - is 35 % cheaper in the champs elysees louis vuitton store .
on the street to get around the ' two items per person ' restriction , the buyers that fly over from china ask unsuspecting tourists to purchase the luxury goods on their behalf .
passing tourists are stopped a few metres down the street .
if they are prepared to purchase an item , they are given euros in cash and sent into the store while the buyers wait eagerly outside .
in return for their time the tourists that ask are given twenty euros for a coffee .
mostly , though , they seem to treat the deal as simply a favour .
as the day continues and demand picks up , the restrictions are sometimes tightened to just a single item per person .
cost-benefit analysis the informal business that has sprung up from the difference in price must be profitable enough for the buyers to cover their airfare to paris , their stay , and their time spent on the street .
the volume is certainly sufficient to have triggered the restrictions - previously only brought in when stocks have been low .
little bags can be big business but aside from the restriction policy , there is little else that can be done , says stephen king of the british luxury goods council .
" parallel importation , " he points out , " is not against the law in itself . "
cross country comparisons a similar activity takes place across the french borders over to the uk with respect to alcohol .

anyone trying to buy more than two items at once from the louis vuitton mega-boutique on the champs elysees these days faces disappointment .
the restriction is the firm 's attempt to keep bulk buyers at bay - the people flying in from the far east to take advantage of the fact that luxury goods carry a much higher price ticket in japan or china than they do in the west .
the difference is high enough to keep an informal trade in parallel imports thriving .
over there the divergence in price of the same goods between different markets can be explained by the higher costs of doing business .
partly it is rental costs , import duties and the lack of storage space in cities like tokyo which pushes the price up in north east asia .
but more importantly , the high level of local demand in such markets allows the luxury goods to be sold for a higher price .
in fact , says morgan stanley retail specialist claire kent , the difference in price has actually fallen since the 1980s , when the same item was sometimes three times more expensive in japan during that country 's boom years .
the price differential has decreased as local markets have become increasingly comparable in their standard of living and as transportation costs have fallen .
restrictions are tight at the flagship store today , a 40 % premium is the norm for most european luxury goods in asia .
for example , the port tresor wallet - which sells for about 75,000 yen -lrb- $ 700 ; £ 400 -rrb- in the official louis vuitton store in tokyo - is 35 % cheaper in the champs elysees louis vuitton store .
on the street to get around the ' two items per person ' restriction , the buyers that fly over from china ask unsuspecting tourists to purchase the luxury goods on their behalf .
passing tourists are stopped a few metres down the street .
if they are prepared to purchase an item , they are given euros in cash and sent into the store while the buyers wait eagerly outside .
in return for their time the tourists that ask are given twenty euros for a coffee .
mostly , though , they seem to treat the deal as simply a favour .
as the day continues and demand picks up , the restrictions are sometimes tightened to just a single item per person .
cost-benefit analysis the informal business that has sprung up from the difference in price must be profitable enough for the buyers to cover their airfare to paris , their stay , and their time spent on the street .
the volume is certainly sufficient to have triggered the restrictions - previously only brought in when stocks have been low .
little bags can be big business but aside from the restriction policy , there is little else that can be done , says stephen king of the british luxury goods council .
" parallel importation , " he points out , " is not against the law in itself . "

truancy spot fines of £ 100 could apply if these were broken , education minister ivan lewis said .
the association of british travel agents -lrb- abta -rrb- has also written to remind its members the law allows only 10 days ' absence from school a year .
chief executive ian reynolds said it was important children 's education " did not suffer " because of holidays .
new law as advertisers start bombarding people with adverts for next summer 's bargain breaks , mr lewis told parents that such holidays in term time should only be taken with the permission of the head teacher .
he warned them that the new fixed penalty notices for truancy of up to £ 100 , being introduced in new year legislation , could be used on those who did not get permission .
mr reynolds told bbc radio 4 's today programme his members did not want parents to have to cancel holidays they had already booked , so all abta members would remind them of the law at the time of booking .
but some have questioned whether the strategy would succeed in stopping middle class parents taking their children out of school .
alan cogswell , chief education officer with bury council , told today a £ 100 fine would not deter families when they could save several hundred pounds on a holiday by booking outside peak times .
he also questioned whether head teachers would refuse to authorise absences when put under pressure from parents .
" if the schools fail to authorise the absence then the school 's truancy figure will go up - which is counter to government policy , " he said .
rate falls the most recent figures published by the department for education showed a 0.4 % fall in authorised absences at secondary school in the past year but there was no change in the rate of unauthorised absences .
cambridge university researcher ming zhang said the sustained anti-truancy campaign had not cut truancy among children from deprived backgrounds .
" middle class parents are not the intended target , but they also feel the heat when the news headlines suggest there may be a new breed of ' irresponsible parents ' who take their children out of schools for one of their many family holidays , " he said .
' missing important work ' even so , almost everyone took some authorised leave during school time - 92 % of the pupils in primary schools and 93 % of those in secondary schools .
on average they were away from primaries for 17 " half days " - the measure used in the official statistics - and 23 in secondaries .
mr lewis said : " taking a holiday during term time can mean that children miss important school time and coursework and it will be difficult for them to catch up later on .
" taking a child out of school for a holiday without the head 's permission is unacceptable and will be treated as truancy .
" since last year 1,200 truants have been returned to full-time education and 133 of 150 local education authorities have reported an improvement in attendance at secondary level .
" but parents must support their child and their school in making sure that every day counts . "

cambridge university researcher ming zhang said the sustained anti-truancy campaign had not cut truancy among children from deprived backgrounds .

mr lewis said : " taking a holiday during term time can mean that children miss important school time and coursework and it will be difficult for them to catch up later on .
" taking a child out of school for a holiday without the head 's permission is unacceptable and will be treated as truancy .

official statistics suggest disabled people are two to three times more likely to be unemployed than their non-disabled counterparts .
about 38 % of disabled people aged 16 to 34 have an earned income , compared with 64 % of non-disabled people .
but 97 % of europeans think more should be done to integrate disabled people into society .
so has the eydp made a real difference or has 2003 simply seen it " have its turn " in the spotlight ?
the year 's given a boost to the awareness of disability rights and the participation of disabled people which is n't going to disappear disability minister maria eagle earlier this year british sign language was given official recognition and £ 1m was set aside to promote its use .
the british government says the eydp has been the catalyst for a number of things that will make a difference for years to come .
it points to its recently-published draft disability bill as the latest in a number of measures that will improve people 's lives by giving them greater rights and freedoms .
grassroots projects funding was given to the uk disabled people 's parliament which held its first meeting in october .
the strength of the eydp , according to andy rickell - director of the british council of disabled people and a member of the parliament - has been the focus on grassroots projects .
" it 's probably worked out better than we thought , " he said .
" the year has been good insofar as it has encouraged grass roots activity about disabled people 's rights and participation .
" the best way to achieve rights though is to have proper laws for disabled people 's rights , as well as grass roots activity .
and much more is needed to secure our rights . "
disability minister maria eagle points to the variety of activities funded by the government to mark the year .
" we 've spent £ 2.5m and supported 170 projects around the country , many of them who 've have never had any kind of support or money from the government before , " she told bbc news online .
" the year 's given a boost to the awareness of disability rights and the participation of disabled people which is n't going to disappear .
" it 's neither been the beginning nor is it the end of implementing better and full civil rights for disabled people - that task goes on next year . "
' lasting changes ' the body responsible for policing anti-discrimination legislation , the disability rights commission -lrb- drc -rrb- , is more cautious .
drc chairman bert massie said it was too early to say whether any lasting changes would result .
" i 'm long enough in the tooth to remember the international year of disabled people in 1981 , " he said .
you 'd have to look around europe in about five years time to see whether there have been any lasting changes bert massie disability rights commission while many of the initiatives undertaken in 1981 have had no lasting impact , others , according to mr massie , have endured .
" a lot of the transport work which is now delivering a third of accessible buses in london - and more to come - was started then .
" the proposal to amend part m of building regulations , to make buildings accessible , also started then . "
mr massie says it is too early to say how the eydp will be remembered .
" you 'd have to look around europe in about five years time to see whether there have been any lasting changes . "
disastrous start in order to generate awareness of the eydp , the organisers sent a ' bus ' around the eu member states .
the bus - in reality it was a pantechnicon lorry - has clocked up 45,000 kilometres -lrb- just over 28,000 miles -rrb- .
in the process it has attended a road protest in vienna , a real madrid football match , the derby at epsom and had a visit from santa claus in finland .
according to jiska bolhuis who has been co-ordinating the bus 's grand tour , things almost got off to a disastrous start .
" the night before the opening ceremony , the bus had to be parked in the centre of athens , in a part of the city that was not known for its safety .
" of course , burglars tried to break into the bus that night and the next morning we found several locks destroyed .
" but we were also lucky because the thieves had n't actually been able to get into the bus . "
' more pride ' the bbc ouch website , which takes a wry look at disability , has been contemptuously tracking the bus 's journey through europe .
ouch 's editor , damon rose , is unimpressed by the publicity given to the eydp .
" having international events given to us by bureaucrats was never going to enthuse or do anything great , " he said " we have ourselves as disabled people to blame - if we all had a little more pride and wanted to shout about it , a culture would spring up , events would be worth going to and we 'd be ' bigging ourselves up ' . "
the eu needs to go further in securing greater rights for disabled people , according to stefan trömel , director of the european disability forum .
" at the european level we 're disappointed , " he said .
" we need a new eu directive to harmonise rights so that disabled people are able to move freely around europe .
" we 're still pushing for that but the commission is slow to commit itself . "
and although the uk is widely regarded as leading on disability rights in the eu , campaigner andy rickell refuses to be impressed .
" sadly that says more about the poor rights of disabled people in the rest of the eu than how wonderful they are in the uk . "

official statistics suggest disabled people are two to three times more likely to be unemployed than their non-disabled counterparts .
about 38 % of disabled people aged 16 to 34 have an earned income , compared with 64 % of non-disabled people .
but 97 % of europeans think more should be done to integrate disabled people into society .
so has the eydp made a real difference or has 2003 simply seen it " have its turn " in the spotlight ?
the year 's given a boost to the awareness of disability rights and the participation of disabled people which is n't going to disappear disability minister maria eagle earlier this year british sign language was given official recognition and £ 1m was set aside to promote its use .
the british government says the eydp has been the catalyst for a number of things that will make a difference for years to come .
it points to its recently-published draft disability bill as the latest in a number of measures that will improve people 's lives by giving them greater rights and freedoms .
grassroots projects funding was given to the uk disabled people 's parliament which held its first meeting in october .
the strength of the eydp , according to andy rickell - director of the british council of disabled people and a member of the parliament - has been the focus on grassroots projects .
" it 's probably worked out better than we thought , " he said .
" the year has been good insofar as it has encouraged grass roots activity about disabled people 's rights and participation .
" the best way to achieve rights though is to have proper laws for disabled people 's rights , as well as grass roots activity .
and much more is needed to secure our rights . "
disability minister maria eagle points to the variety of activities funded by the government to mark the year .
" we 've spent £ 2.5m and supported 170 projects around the country , many of them who 've have never had any kind of support or money from the government before , " she told bbc news online .
" the year 's given a boost to the awareness of disability rights and the participation of disabled people which is n't going to disappear .
" it 's neither been the beginning nor is it the end of implementing better and full civil rights for disabled people - that task goes on next year . "
' lasting changes ' the body responsible for policing anti-discrimination legislation , the disability rights commission -lrb- drc -rrb- , is more cautious .
drc chairman bert massie said it was too early to say whether any lasting changes would result .
" i 'm long enough in the tooth to remember the international year of disabled people in 1981 , " he said .
you 'd have to look around europe in about five years time to see whether there have been any lasting changes bert massie disability rights commission while many of the initiatives undertaken in 1981 have had no lasting impact , others , according to mr massie , have endured .
" a lot of the transport work which is now delivering a third of accessible buses in london - and more to come - was started then .
" the proposal to amend part m of building regulations , to make buildings accessible , also started then . "
mr massie says it is too early to say how the eydp will be remembered .
" you 'd have to look around europe in about five years time to see whether there have been any lasting changes . "
disastrous start in order to generate awareness of the eydp , the organisers sent a ' bus ' around the eu member states .
the bus - in reality it was a pantechnicon lorry - has clocked up 45,000 kilometres -lrb- just over 28,000 miles -rrb- .
in the process it has attended a road protest in vienna , a real madrid football match , the derby at epsom and had a visit from santa claus in finland .
according to jiska bolhuis who has been co-ordinating the bus 's grand tour , things almost got off to a disastrous start .
" the night before the opening ceremony , the bus had to be parked in the centre of athens , in a part of the city that was not known for its safety .
" of course , burglars tried to break into the bus that night and the next morning we found several locks destroyed .
" but we were also lucky because the thieves had n't actually been able to get into the bus . "
' more pride ' the bbc ouch website , which takes a wry look at disability , has been contemptuously tracking the bus 's journey through europe .
ouch 's editor , damon rose , is unimpressed by the publicity given to the eydp .
" having international events given to us by bureaucrats was never going to enthuse or do anything great , " he said " we have ourselves as disabled people to blame - if we all had a little more pride and wanted to shout about it , a culture would spring up , events would be worth going to and we 'd be ' bigging ourselves up ' . "
the eu needs to go further in securing greater rights for disabled people , according to stefan trömel , director of the european disability forum .

it points to its recently-published draft disability bill as the latest in a number of measures that will improve people 's lives by giving them greater rights and freedoms .
grassroots projects funding was given to the uk disabled people 's parliament which held its first meeting in october .
the strength of the eydp , according to andy rickell - director of the british council of disabled people and a member of the parliament - has been the focus on grassroots projects .
" it 's probably worked out better than we thought , " he said .
" the year has been good insofar as it has encouraged grass roots activity about disabled people 's rights and participation .
" the best way to achieve rights though is to have proper laws for disabled people 's rights , as well as grass roots activity .
and much more is needed to secure our rights . "
disability minister maria eagle points to the variety of activities funded by the government to mark the year .
" we 've spent £ 2.5m and supported 170 projects around the country , many of them who 've have never had any kind of support or money from the government before , " she told bbc news online .
" the year 's given a boost to the awareness of disability rights and the participation of disabled people which is n't going to disappear .
" it 's neither been the beginning nor is it the end of implementing better and full civil rights for disabled people - that task goes on next year . "
' lasting changes ' the body responsible for policing anti-discrimination legislation , the disability rights commission -lrb- drc -rrb- , is more cautious .
drc chairman bert massie said it was too early to say whether any lasting changes would result .
" i 'm long enough in the tooth to remember the international year of disabled people in 1981 , " he said .
you 'd have to look around europe in about five years time to see whether there have been any lasting changes bert massie disability rights commission while many of the initiatives undertaken in 1981 have had no lasting impact , others , according to mr massie , have endured .
" a lot of the transport work which is now delivering a third of accessible buses in london - and more to come - was started then .
" the proposal to amend part m of building regulations , to make buildings accessible , also started then . "
mr massie says it is too early to say how the eydp will be remembered .
" you 'd have to look around europe in about five years time to see whether there have been any lasting changes . "
disastrous start in order to generate awareness of the eydp , the organisers sent a ' bus ' around the eu member states .
the bus - in reality it was a pantechnicon lorry - has clocked up 45,000 kilometres -lrb- just over 28,000 miles -rrb- .
in the process it has attended a road protest in vienna , a real madrid football match , the derby at epsom and had a visit from santa claus in finland .
according to jiska bolhuis who has been co-ordinating the bus 's grand tour , things almost got off to a disastrous start .
" the night before the opening ceremony , the bus had to be parked in the centre of athens , in a part of the city that was not known for its safety .
" of course , burglars tried to break into the bus that night and the next morning we found several locks destroyed .
" but we were also lucky because the thieves had n't actually been able to get into the bus . "
' more pride ' the bbc ouch website , which takes a wry look at disability , has been contemptuously tracking the bus 's journey through europe .
ouch 's editor , damon rose , is unimpressed by the publicity given to the eydp .
" having international events given to us by bureaucrats was never going to enthuse or do anything great , " he said " we have ourselves as disabled people to blame - if we all had a little more pride and wanted to shout about it , a culture would spring up , events would be worth going to and we 'd be ' bigging ourselves up ' . "
the eu needs to go further in securing greater rights for disabled people , according to stefan trömel , director of the european disability forum .
" at the european level we 're disappointed , " he said .
" we need a new eu directive to harmonise rights so that disabled people are able to move freely around europe .
" we 're still pushing for that but the commission is slow to commit itself . "
and although the uk is widely regarded as leading on disability rights in the eu , campaigner andy rickell refuses to be impressed .
" sadly that says more about the poor rights of disabled people in the rest of the eu than how wonderful they are in the uk . "

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- the politics of earthquakes bbc news / middle east graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 30 december , 2003 , 10:49 gmt the politics of earthquakes by paul reynolds bbc news online world affairs correspondent earthquakes sometimes do more than destroy lives and buildings - they can reshape the political landscape .
the earthquake in bam has already seen a us offer to help iran and an iranian acceptance .
this is between two countries which normally exchange insults .
iran 's readiness to accept a direct offer of help from washington follows its agreement with the international atomic energy agency to allow more intrusive inspections of its nuclear programme . "
the handling of this crisis will help determine president khatami 's continuing popularity " this has led the us secretary of state colin powell to say in an interview with the washington post : " there are things happening and therefore we should keep open the possibility of dialogue at an appropriate point in the future . "
a recent example of an effect on policy was the earthquake in turkey in august 1999 , which killed about 15,000 people .
prompt action by greece in sending help led to a rapprochement between two traditional enemies .
the greek foreign minister , george papandreou , became something of a hero in turkey .
greece announced that it was supporting turkish entry into the european union with mr papandreou declaring : " we want to become the steam engine inside the eu to help turkey 's european course . "
the earthquake also showed the turkish political establishment that it had to reform .
the powerful role of the military in turkey was seriously questioned because the army failed to respond to the disaster quickly , arguing that it was up to the civilian authorities .
the collapse of so many modern buildings revealed that building regulations had simply been ignored in the rush to industrialise the mud plains east of istanbul , despite warnings that this was earthquake territory of the most vulnerable kind .
another example of a " political " earthquake was in nicaragua in 1972 .
this forgotten part of central america was under the rule of the somoza family and it was n't until the capital managua was all but destroyed that the attention of the outside world turned to this particularly nasty little dictatorship .
what the outside world saw was not pleasant .
president anastasio somoza failed to organise a proper rescue and rebuilding effort .
huge parts of the capital lay in waste for years .
this led to further unrest , culminating in the uprising which brought the sandinistas to power in 1979 .
cost factor " there are many small kilns producing bricks but because of the demand , these are not fired for the 28 days needed to make them strong " professor mohsen aboutorabi in bam , the same kind of story is emerging which was evident in turkey .
mohsen aboutorabi , professor of architecture at the university of central england who was in bam for a conference two years ago , told bbc news online : " in bam and other cities , i found that much of the building is done by people putting up their own houses .
but they can not afford proper materials and do not use skilled labour .
" there are many small kilns producing bricks but because of the demand , these are not fired for the 28 days needed to make them strong .
i banged two bricks together and they just fell to pieces .
" for high rise buildings , the regulations are better enforced .
but the demand for housing is so big .
iran 's population has doubled in the last 20 years , " he said .
turning point ?
professor aboutorabi said that there was bound to be a political effect from the earthquake .
" if the political leaders do not listen to the people , they will be in trouble , " he said .
he added , however : " traditionally in iran , people tend to rally behind the government and this might give the government an umbrella for a time . "
iran is currently poised delicately both internally and externally .
the reform-minded president mohammad khatami was overwhelmingly re-elected in 2001 in what was seen as a further move away from clerical rule .
the handling of this crisis will help determine his continuing popularity .
he has got off to a good start by admitting that iran can not cope on its own and asking for outside help -lrb- except from israel ... some things do not change -rrb- .
this openness could be a development of iran 's readiness to co-operate with the international atomic energy agency 's insistence that the country 's nuclear programme be put under proper monitoring .
fatalism one of iran 's leading earthquake experts , professor bahram akasheh of tehran university , was quoted recently by the australian institute of geoscientists as saying that tehran itself should be moved because it is at such high risk .
" it would be better to have the capital in somewhere near isfahan : that would be safer .
other countries have changed their capital without any adverse effect . "
" earthquake education is very poor in iran .
most people think that whatever god wills , will happen .
this is absolutely wrong .
this thinking is poisonous " professor bahram akasheh professor akasheh said little heed was paid to regulations .
" building regulations were introduced but nobody actually does everything that the regulations stipulate . "
one of the most difficult problems , he said , was the air of fatalism with which iranians view earthquakes .

us rapprochement ?
up until now , us policy towards iran has veered between treating it as part of the " axis of evil " , as president bush once called it , and adopting the more pragmatic approach of european countries .
however , american diplomacy has recently had a success in the decision by libyan to declare and abandon whatever programmes it has for weapons of mass destruction .
this followed tehran 's acceptance of the iaea additional protocol .
but mr powell has made it clear that there were still issues with iran to be resolved .
" we still have concerns about terrorist activities , of course , and there are other issues with respect to al-qaeda and other matters that we 'll have to keep in mind . "
among these " other matters " might be the charge by israel that iran supports hamas and other groups attacking israel .
indeed , if washington were to adopt a softer approach to tehran , the israelis might not be best pleased .
senior israeli security chiefs regard iran as their " number one " threat .

the earthquake in bam has already seen a us offer to help iran and an iranian acceptance .
this is between two countries which normally exchange insults .
iran 's readiness to accept a direct offer of help from washington follows its agreement with the international atomic energy agency to allow more intrusive inspections of its nuclear programme .
the handling of this crisis will help determine president khatami 's continuing popularity this has led the us secretary of state colin powell to say in an interview with the washington post : " there are things happening and therefore we should keep open the possibility of dialogue at an appropriate point in the future . "
a recent example of an effect on policy was the earthquake in turkey in august 1999 , which killed about 15,000 people .
prompt action by greece in sending help led to a rapprochement between two traditional enemies .
the greek foreign minister , george papandreou , became something of a hero in turkey .
greece announced that it was supporting turkish entry into the european union with mr papandreou declaring : " we want to become the steam engine inside the eu to help turkey 's european course . "
the earthquake also showed the turkish political establishment that it had to reform .
the powerful role of the military in turkey was seriously questioned because the army failed to respond to the disaster quickly , arguing that it was up to the civilian authorities .
turkey 's earthquake brought it closer to greece the collapse of so many modern buildings revealed that building regulations had simply been ignored in the rush to industrialise the mud plains east of istanbul , despite warnings that this was earthquake territory of the most vulnerable kind .
another example of a " political " earthquake was in nicaragua in 1972 .
this forgotten part of central america was under the rule of the somoza family and it was n't until the capital managua was all but destroyed that the attention of the outside world turned to this particularly nasty little dictatorship .
what the outside world saw was not pleasant .
president anastasio somoza failed to organise a proper rescue and rebuilding effort .
huge parts of the capital lay in waste for years .
this led to further unrest , culminating in the uprising which brought the sandinistas to power in 1979 .

mohsen aboutorabi , professor of architecture at the university of central england who was in bam for a conference two years ago , told bbc news online : " in bam and other cities , i found that much of the building is done by people putting up their own houses .
but they can not afford proper materials and do not use skilled labour .
" there are many small kilns producing bricks but because of the demand , these are not fired for the 28 days needed to make them strong .
i banged two bricks together and they just fell to pieces .
" for high rise buildings , the regulations are better enforced .
but the demand for housing is so big .
iran 's population has doubled in the last 20 years , " he said .
turning point ?
professor aboutorabi said that there was bound to be a political effect from the earthquake .
" if the political leaders do not listen to the people , they will be in trouble , " he said .
many bodies are believed to be still under the rubble in bam he added , however : " traditionally in iran , people tend to rally behind the government and this might give the government an umbrella for a time . "
iran is currently poised delicately both internally and externally .

the earthquake in bam has already seen a us offer to help iran and an iranian acceptance .
this is between two countries which normally exchange insults .
iran 's readiness to accept a direct offer of help from washington follows its agreement with the international atomic energy agency to allow more intrusive inspections of its nuclear programme .
the handling of this crisis will help determine president khatami 's continuing popularity this has led the us secretary of state colin powell to say in an interview with the washington post : " there are things happening and therefore we should keep open the possibility of dialogue at an appropriate point in the future . "
a recent example of an effect on policy was the earthquake in turkey in august 1999 , which killed about 15,000 people .
prompt action by greece in sending help led to a rapprochement between two traditional enemies .
the greek foreign minister , george papandreou , became something of a hero in turkey .
greece announced that it was supporting turkish entry into the european union with mr papandreou declaring : " we want to become the steam engine inside the eu to help turkey 's european course . "
the earthquake also showed the turkish political establishment that it had to reform .
the powerful role of the military in turkey was seriously questioned because the army failed to respond to the disaster quickly , arguing that it was up to the civilian authorities .
turkey 's earthquake brought it closer to greece the collapse of so many modern buildings revealed that building regulations had simply been ignored in the rush to industrialise the mud plains east of istanbul , despite warnings that this was earthquake territory of the most vulnerable kind .
another example of a " political " earthquake was in nicaragua in 1972 .
this forgotten part of central america was under the rule of the somoza family and it was n't until the capital managua was all but destroyed that the attention of the outside world turned to this particularly nasty little dictatorship .
what the outside world saw was not pleasant .
president anastasio somoza failed to organise a proper rescue and rebuilding effort .
huge parts of the capital lay in waste for years .
this led to further unrest , culminating in the uprising which brought the sandinistas to power in 1979 .
cost factor there are many small kilns producing bricks but because of the demand , these are not fired for the 28 days needed to make them strong professor mohsen aboutorabi in bam , the same kind of story is emerging which was evident in turkey .
mohsen aboutorabi , professor of architecture at the university of central england who was in bam for a conference two years ago , told bbc news online : " in bam and other cities , i found that much of the building is done by people putting up their own houses .
but they can not afford proper materials and do not use skilled labour .
" there are many small kilns producing bricks but because of the demand , these are not fired for the 28 days needed to make them strong .
i banged two bricks together and they just fell to pieces .
" for high rise buildings , the regulations are better enforced .
but the demand for housing is so big .
iran 's population has doubled in the last 20 years , " he said .
turning point ?
professor aboutorabi said that there was bound to be a political effect from the earthquake .
" if the political leaders do not listen to the people , they will be in trouble , " he said .
many bodies are believed to be still under the rubble in bam he added , however : " traditionally in iran , people tend to rally behind the government and this might give the government an umbrella for a time . "
iran is currently poised delicately both internally and externally .
the reform-minded president mohammad khatami was overwhelmingly re-elected in 2001 in what was seen as a further move away from clerical rule .
the handling of this crisis will help determine his continuing popularity .
he has got off to a good start by admitting that iran can not cope on its own and asking for outside help -lrb- except from israel ... some things do not change -rrb- .
this openness could be a development of iran 's readiness to co-operate with the international atomic energy agency 's insistence that the country 's nuclear programme be put under proper monitoring .
fatalism one of iran 's leading earthquake experts , professor bahram akasheh of tehran university , was quoted recently by the australian institute of geoscientists as saying that tehran itself should be moved because it is at such high risk .
" it would be better to have the capital in somewhere near isfahan : that would be safer .
other countries have changed their capital without any adverse effect . "
earthquake education is very poor in iran .
most people think that whatever god wills , will happen .
this is absolutely wrong .
this thinking is poisonous professor bahram akasheh professor akasheh said little heed was paid to regulations .
" building regulations were introduced but nobody actually does everything that the regulations stipulate . "
one of the most difficult problems , he said , was the air of fatalism with which iranians view earthquakes .
" earthquake education is very poor in iran .
most people think that whatever god wills , will happen .
this is absolutely wrong .
this thinking is poisonous . "
us rapprochement ?
up until now , us policy towards iran has veered between treating it as part of the " axis of evil " , as president bush once called it , and adopting the more pragmatic approach of european countries .
however , american diplomacy has recently had a success in the decision by libyan to declare and abandon whatever programmes it has for weapons of mass destruction .
this followed tehran 's acceptance of the iaea additional protocol .
but mr powell has made it clear that there were still issues with iran to be resolved .
" we still have concerns about terrorist activities , of course , and there are other issues with respect to al-qaeda and other matters that we 'll have to keep in mind . "
among these " other matters " might be the charge by israel that iran supports hamas and other groups attacking israel .
indeed , if washington were to adopt a softer approach to tehran , the israelis might not be best pleased .
senior israeli security chiefs regard iran as their " number one " threat .
