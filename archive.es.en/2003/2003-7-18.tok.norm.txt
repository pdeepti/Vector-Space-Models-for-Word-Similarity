sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .
tony blair is a leader of conviction , of passion and of moral clarity .
he is a true friend of the american people . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blix criticizes blair over iraq dossier hans blix , the former head of the un weapons inspectors , has spoken out against the wording of britain ’ s case for war on iraq as the pressure on prime minister tony blair continues to mount .

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .

germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .

the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .

kraftwerk is back the love parade is dead , long live the love parade cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bands , like surferosa from norway , will be performing at popkomm in berlin from 2004 .
the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 film classics for the classroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to make cinema an integral part of childhood education by screening classic films .
a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 film classics for the classroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to make cinema an integral part of childhood education by screening classic films .
a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.07.2003 blair tells congress : history will forgive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no churchill " v for victory " but a blair " thumbs up for congress " british prime minister tony blair told the u.s. congress on thursday that if no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq , at least the world was rid of a brutal dictator . despite mounting doubts over intelligence concerning saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction and the justifications for going to war , the joint press conference at the white house given by british prime minister tony blair and united states president george w. bush was never going to include the statement , “ we got it wrong .
sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .
tony blair is a leader of conviction , of passion and of moral clarity .
he is a true friend of the american people . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blix criticizes blair over iraq dossier hans blix , the former head of the un weapons inspectors , has spoken out against the wording of britain ’ s case for war on iraq as the pressure on prime minister tony blair continues to mount .

for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .

but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .

germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .

berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .

the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .
the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .
offices of bmg entertainment , a division of bertelsmann ag , followed soon after .
now , more than 50 percent of the german music industry is based in berlin , according to the media office berlin-brandenburg . other industry re-locations include the echo german record prize which moved to the capital from hamburg where important national organisations such as the federal association of the recording industry , the german phono-akademie and the german group of the ifpi , the international record industry association , remain . attractive cultural climate # b # the attraction of berlin may be attributed to the city ’ s speed of modernisation since reunification and the number of vacant buildings still available but it is more likely to be the attractive cultural climate .
berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .

a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 film classics for the classroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to make cinema an integral part of childhood education by screening classic films .
a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .

each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.07.2003 germany 's fischer offers diplomacy lesson großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during his visit to the united states this week , joschka fischer sought to show that germany and the u.s. have reconciled .
for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .

a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .
tony blair is a leader of conviction , of passion and of moral clarity .
he is a true friend of the american people . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blix criticizes blair over iraq dossier hans blix , the former head of the un weapons inspectors , has spoken out against the wording of britain ’ s case for war on iraq as the pressure on prime minister tony blair continues to mount .

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

kraftwerk is back the love parade is dead , long live the love parade cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bands , like surferosa from norway , will be performing at popkomm in berlin from 2004 .
the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .
the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .
offices of bmg entertainment , a division of bertelsmann ag , followed soon after .
now , more than 50 percent of the german music industry is based in berlin , according to the media office berlin-brandenburg . other industry re-locations include the echo german record prize which moved to the capital from hamburg where important national organisations such as the federal association of the recording industry , the german phono-akademie and the german group of the ifpi , the international record industry association , remain . attractive cultural climate # b # the attraction of berlin may be attributed to the city ’ s speed of modernisation since reunification and the number of vacant buildings still available but it is more likely to be the attractive cultural climate .
berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .
" berlin is the cheapest metropolis ; its internal flair and young creative potential give the location an unmistakable advantage , " concluded a study by the german institute for economic research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry fights file-sharing with official downloads amid sinking record sales , the beleaguered german record industry has joined a europe-wide initiative to combat popular file-sharing services where internet users swap music for free .

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .

moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .

kraftwerk is back the love parade is dead , long live the love parade cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bands , like surferosa from norway , will be performing at popkomm in berlin from 2004 .
the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .
the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .
offices of bmg entertainment , a division of bertelsmann ag , followed soon after .
now , more than 50 percent of the german music industry is based in berlin , according to the media office berlin-brandenburg . other industry re-locations include the echo german record prize which moved to the capital from hamburg where important national organisations such as the federal association of the recording industry , the german phono-akademie and the german group of the ifpi , the international record industry association , remain . attractive cultural climate # b # the attraction of berlin may be attributed to the city ’ s speed of modernisation since reunification and the number of vacant buildings still available but it is more likely to be the attractive cultural climate .
berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 film classics for the classroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to make cinema an integral part of childhood education by screening classic films .
a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .
tony blair is a leader of conviction , of passion and of moral clarity .
he is a true friend of the american people . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blix criticizes blair over iraq dossier hans blix , the former head of the un weapons inspectors , has spoken out against the wording of britain ’ s case for war on iraq as the pressure on prime minister tony blair continues to mount .

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 film classics for the classroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to make cinema an integral part of childhood education by screening classic films .
a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

kraftwerk is back the love parade is dead , long live the love parade cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bands , like surferosa from norway , will be performing at popkomm in berlin from 2004 .
the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .
the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .
offices of bmg entertainment , a division of bertelsmann ag , followed soon after .
now , more than 50 percent of the german music industry is based in berlin , according to the media office berlin-brandenburg . other industry re-locations include the echo german record prize which moved to the capital from hamburg where important national organisations such as the federal association of the recording industry , the german phono-akademie and the german group of the ifpi , the international record industry association , remain . attractive cultural climate # b # the attraction of berlin may be attributed to the city ’ s speed of modernisation since reunification and the number of vacant buildings still available but it is more likely to be the attractive cultural climate .
berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .
tony blair is a leader of conviction , of passion and of moral clarity .
he is a true friend of the american people . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blix criticizes blair over iraq dossier hans blix , the former head of the un weapons inspectors , has spoken out against the wording of britain ’ s case for war on iraq as the pressure on prime minister tony blair continues to mount .

a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 film classics for the classroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to make cinema an integral part of childhood education by screening classic films .
a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .

congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .

moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .

kraftwerk is back the love parade is dead , long live the love parade cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bands , like surferosa from norway , will be performing at popkomm in berlin from 2004 .
the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .

the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”

a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.07.2003 germany 's fischer offers diplomacy lesson großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during his visit to the united states this week , joschka fischer sought to show that germany and the u.s. have reconciled .
for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .
the government must ensure that nato remains the primary instrument of security policy .
a european defense policy that america perceives as competing with nato would poison bilateral relations . and german politicians must make it clear to their public that the threat of terrorism is a global problem not just an american one . if they succeed , the much-evoked " community of values " could develop into a new security partnership that would fulfill the demands of the 21st century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz , deutsche welle daniel scheschkewitz is deutsche welle 's washington correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers iraq support , but no troops in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there .

for the most part he succeeded , but a new security partnership will require more . joschka fischer was in a tricky position on his first visit to the united states since the iraq war .
the german foreign minister had to practice damage control there , without giving people at home the impression he was eating humble pie . fischer stuck closely to chancellor gerhard schröder 's insistence that germany will not send troops to iraq for the time being .
on the other hand , he indicated that his country would be willing to cooperate in rebuilding iraq - providing humanitarian relief and technical aid in reconstruction efforts .
the issue should n't hinder improving german-american relations . fischer 's appearance in the american media was well-orchestrated .
during the iraq crisis u.s. journalists accompanied assessments of germany 's role with predominantly negative commentary . yet this time , fischer 's interviews were a lesson in effective public diplomacy .
he managed to rectify many a misunderstanding and make the prospect of future transatlantic cooperation appealing for the u.s. audience . the timing was auspicious , too , since americans are increasingly questioning whether it was right to go to war against iraq . business-like talks berlin and washington communicate with each other on the basis of a business-like foundation - illustrated by talks with fischer and numerous visits to washington by other german ministers in the preceding months .
whether they can now develop a new strategic partnership , which fischer would like , depends on various factors , not lastly on how aggressive the u.s. pursues its campaign against terrorism . and berlin can also contribute to a positive development .

a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .
in autumn , the body will make its final decision on which films teachers are required to screen with their pupils . the following films are on the list : " battleship potemkin " - sergei eisenstein , soviet union 1925 " m " - fritz lang , germany 1931 " nosferatu " - f.w. murnau , germany 1922 " gold rush " - charlie chaplin , usa 1925 " the wild child " - francois truffaut , france 1969 " taxi driver " - martin scorcese , usa 1975 " la strada " - federico fellini , italy 1954 " the bridge " - bernhard wicki , west germany 1959 " vertigo " - alfred hitchcock , usa 1958 " dr. strangelove " - stanley kubrick , usa 1964 " emil and the detectives " - gerhard lamprecht , germany 1930 " the wizard of oz " - victor fleming , usa 1939 " the jungle book " - wolfgang reitherman , usa 1967 " where is the friend 's home ?

kraftwerk is back the love parade is dead , long live the love parade cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bands , like surferosa from norway , will be performing at popkomm in berlin from 2004 .
the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .
the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .
offices of bmg entertainment , a division of bertelsmann ag , followed soon after .
now , more than 50 percent of the german music industry is based in berlin , according to the media office berlin-brandenburg . other industry re-locations include the echo german record prize which moved to the capital from hamburg where important national organisations such as the federal association of the recording industry , the german phono-akademie and the german group of the ifpi , the international record industry association , remain . attractive cultural climate # b # the attraction of berlin may be attributed to the city ’ s speed of modernisation since reunification and the number of vacant buildings still available but it is more likely to be the attractive cultural climate .
berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .

kraftwerk is back the love parade is dead , long live the love parade cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bands , like surferosa from norway , will be performing at popkomm in berlin from 2004 .
the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .
the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .
offices of bmg entertainment , a division of bertelsmann ag , followed soon after .
now , more than 50 percent of the german music industry is based in berlin , according to the media office berlin-brandenburg . other industry re-locations include the echo german record prize which moved to the capital from hamburg where important national organisations such as the federal association of the recording industry , the german phono-akademie and the german group of the ifpi , the international record industry association , remain . attractive cultural climate # b # the attraction of berlin may be attributed to the city ’ s speed of modernisation since reunification and the number of vacant buildings still available but it is more likely to be the attractive cultural climate .
berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?

let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .

moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2003 film classics for the classroom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to make cinema an integral part of childhood education by screening classic films .
a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .

a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .

moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .

a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .

sorry . ” meeting in washington on thursday against a backdrop of international concern , including growing doubts over whether or not the iraqi regime had attempted to buy uranium from niger , both leaders maintained their resolve over the iraq war throughout the tepid examination . “ the regime of saddam hussein was a grave and growing threat .
given saddam 's history of violence and aggression , it would have been reckless to place our trust in his sanity or his restraint , ” said bush .
he added that , by going to war , the united states and britain ended the threat of saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair .
the prime minister echoed the president ’ s sentiments by repeating a coalition coda that many in the room had witnessed on previous occasions : “ let us be clear - we have been dealing with a situation in which the threat was very clear , and the person , saddam hussein , wielding that threat was someone of total brutality and ruthlessness . ” amendment to the script it was only when blair arrived later that evening to give a historic address to the u.s. congress that the british premier strayed from the script and briefly offered the world something new . in a speech which was described by a government aide as one the prime minister had “ sweated blood ” over , blair massaged the assembled great and good of american politics by describing the u.s. as a “ light of liberty ” and apologizing for the british burning of congress ' library in 1812 .
congress duly responded in kind by delivering 19 standing ovations during the 32 minute address , prompting the prime minister to bashfully admit it was more than he was used to at home . but amongst the few moments where the prime minister was actually allowed to speak , he made a series of comments that must have made some of those seated eager to stand up again , such was the uncomfortable nature of his remarks in the light of the current controversy over the coalition ’ s reasons for war . a softer british stance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anybody seen any wmd ?
in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .

he is a true friend of the american people . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blix criticizes blair over iraq dossier hans blix , the former head of the un weapons inspectors , has spoken out against the wording of britain ’ s case for war on iraq as the pressure on prime minister tony blair continues to mount .

the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .
the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .
offices of bmg entertainment , a division of bertelsmann ag , followed soon after .
now , more than 50 percent of the german music industry is based in berlin , according to the media office berlin-brandenburg . other industry re-locations include the echo german record prize which moved to the capital from hamburg where important national organisations such as the federal association of the recording industry , the german phono-akademie and the german group of the ifpi , the international record industry association , remain . attractive cultural climate # b # the attraction of berlin may be attributed to the city ’ s speed of modernisation since reunification and the number of vacant buildings still available but it is more likely to be the attractive cultural climate .
berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .

in what appeared to be a significant softening of downing street 's stance on iraq 's banned weapons , blair admitted to the assembled members of congress that he may eventually be proved wrong and that history would “ forgive ” him even if no weapons of mass destruction are uncovered in iraq . “ can we be sure that terrorism and weapons of mass destruction will join together ?
let us say one thing .
if we are wrong we will have destroyed a threat that , at its least , is responsible for inhuman carnage and suffering .
that is something i am confident history will forgive . ” this rare glimpse of fallibility comes just days after blair declared that britain and the u.s. may only uncover a weapons program , rather than actual weapons themselves . but before officials could slide away to prepare statements explaining why this was not the admission doubters had been waiting for , blair saved them the trouble , adding with insistence that he still believed he would be proved right .
" if our critics are wrong , if we are right as i believe with every fiber of instinct and conviction i have that we are , and we do not act , then we will have hesitated in the face of this menace when we should have given leadership ; that is something history will not forgive . " transatlantic two-way relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and tony blair .
moving away from the tender , yet far from healed wound of iraq , blair turned his congress address towards the transatlantic relationship .
in an uncompromising message to both europe and the united states , blair described the bond between the two powers as a “ two-way relationship in which both sides must be prepared to give ground . ” he declared : “ to be a serious partner , europe must take on and defeat the anti-americanism that sometimes passes for its political discourse .
what america must do is to show that this is a partnership built on persuasion , not command . ” blair saved his most barbed message , although one barely disguised , for jacques chirac , insinuating that the french president wanted to turn europe into a rival power to the u.s.
“ there is no more dangerous theory in international politics today than that we need to balance the power of america with other competitive powers , different poles around which nations gather . ” his speech was lauded by president bush as “ fabulous ” saying in the press conference that followed , “ the prime minister once again showed the qualities that have marked his entire career .

he is a true friend of the american people . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blix criticizes blair over iraq dossier hans blix , the former head of the un weapons inspectors , has spoken out against the wording of britain ’ s case for war on iraq as the pressure on prime minister tony blair continues to mount .

a team of representatives from the world of film has agreed on a list of films it says are essential to the education of german school children .
it aims to incorporate the medium into the official school curriculum . until recently , film was not a medium common in german classrooms . that may change soon .
this week , the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- , with the help of a few of germany 's top film directors , presented a list of films to be included in the german curriculum next year .
with the list , the center wants to incorporate the world of film as a permanent element into german school education and hopes to make school children familiar with " a medium that like no other has influenced the culture and everyday life of modern people , " bpb president thomas krüger said on wednesday . essential for education " although film is the medium of the 20th century , it still has n't been recognized properly as such in schools , as is the case with literature , " thomas krüger said .
the film canon is the result of a congress in march titled " film goes to school " during which both educational policy makers and representatives from film companies and cinema associations agreed on the need for the introduction of film in germany 's school curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week , a commission made up of people and personalities from both the world of film and politics including directors tom tykwer and volker schlöndorff , got together in berlin to discuss the issue and decide on those films thought essential for children 's education . the jury members described the process as a difficult task and one which proved particularly difficult for modern films made in the past decade - only two were included . no action , please the film canon as it stands now is to include both german and international movies .
the list runs the gamut from all-time classics such as charlie chaplin 's " gold rush " -lrb- usa 1925 -rrb- , orson welles " citizen kane " -lrb- usa 1941 -rrb- , federico fellini 's " la strada " -lrb- italy 1954 -rrb- to more unconventional , yet highly acclaimed movies like martin scorcese 's " taxi driver " -lrb- usa 1975 -rrb- and " alice in the cities " by german director wim wenders -lrb- germany 1973 -rrb- .
all 35 films on the list were selected " as particularly suitable for making children familiar with the various forms and content the medium film . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord of the rings although the list covers almost 100 years of film history , there is a noticeable absence of action films and light , modern-day movie hits .
" not every film which is the talk of the town is suitable for education , " krüger said on wednesday .
recent blockbusters such as " matrix " or " the lord of the rings " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which attracted worldwide acclaim alone due to their usage of new computer technologies , do not belong to the list .
to choose action films like " matrix " would be absurd , said alfred holighaus , who directs the german film program at the berlin international film festival . classics still relevant " in the classics there is much to be discovered which is still relevant today , " hans helmut prinzler , the director of the berlin film museum , said .
whether laurel and hardy and " gold rush " will stay on the list , however , remains to be seen . the selected films will now be debated by the standing conference of ministers of education and culture affairs of the german states , the body responsible for national education curriculums , and in an open debate planned later in the year .

the decision to move the world ’ s biggest music trade fair from its home in cologne to berlin is just the latest in a series of media and entertainment relocations to the german capital from around the country . what has berlin got that other german cities haven ’ t ?
for one thing , berlin has more and more of the things many other german cities used to have .
after being a city divided and a cold war island , modern berlin is becoming a magnet for those areas of german industry traditionally situated in other parts of the country . when the berlin wall came down in 1989 and germany became a reunified country , the cold war capital of bonn lost most of its governmental buildings and embassies to the re-established center of power .
since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .
but now , after 14 years in cologne , popkomm is turning its back on its traditional venue at the köln messe conference center and is heading for the bright lights of berlin .
the 2003 event will be the last held in cologne before its debut in berlin next year . moving to save popkomm “ we did not reach this decision lightly , but this was the only way we could secure the future of popkomm . ”
dieter gorny , manager of viva media said on thursday in cologne .
a contract was signed between the viva group , one of the main sponsors and organizers of the event , and the trade fair company , messe berlin , on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sony center in berlin .
each year , the august trade fair attracts some 800 exhibitors from around the world and presents between 400 and 500 bands from more than 27 countries at the ringfest concert program which attracts an average annual audience of two million fans over the three days .
but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .
it is hoped that the relocation to the capital will boost the flagging attendance figures and benefit berlin ’ s standing in the music industry even further . the latest relocation “ popkomm strengthens berlin 's profile as germany 's music capital and as a trade fair location , ” said head of berlin 's senate economic department harald wolf in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
speculation about a possible move to the capital had been ripe since a number of music and entertainment companies chose to call berlin their new home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade , berlin .
germany 's capital city is already home to the german subsidiaries of giant music and entertainment companies universal and sony , who have expanded their berlin office with the independent label , berlin-records .
media mammoth universal was originally based in hamburg which until recently was the hub of germany ’ s € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.3 billion -rrb- music industry – the fourth largest in the world . hamburg relinquishes music center by 2000 , the most recent year for which figures are available , 430 companies of the music industry called berlin its home .
the german branch of sony corporation 's sony music was the first big player to move , arriving in summer 2000 from hamburg .
offices of bmg entertainment , a division of bertelsmann ag , followed soon after .
now , more than 50 percent of the german music industry is based in berlin , according to the media office berlin-brandenburg . other industry re-locations include the echo german record prize which moved to the capital from hamburg where important national organisations such as the federal association of the recording industry , the german phono-akademie and the german group of the ifpi , the international record industry association , remain . attractive cultural climate # b # the attraction of berlin may be attributed to the city ’ s speed of modernisation since reunification and the number of vacant buildings still available but it is more likely to be the attractive cultural climate .
berlin is already the home of the world famous love parade , the coulurful carnival of culture , musical festival fête de la musique -not to forget its thriving creative subculture .
ironically , the music industry benefits from the city 's high unemployment rate which consistently hangs around 17 percent .
the depressed economy has led to low rents - bad for the real-estate market but great for the music clubs and venues that have sprung up around the city and contribute to its attraction .

since then , the number of business sectors , events and company headquarters moving to berlin has gradually increased . the latest city to give up one of its crown jewels is cologne .
widely recognised as one of the most important media and entertainment centers in germany , cologne has been the home of the world 's biggest music trade fair , popkomm , since it moved down the rhine river from its first home in düsseldorf in 1989 .

but in recent years , the number of visitors to the trade fair has dropped drastically .
last year , less than 15,000 people experienced the showcases and seminars which make up the fair held beside the rhine .

but as the fourth lakme india fashion week begins in bombay , many are asking whether this interest will translate into business .
the event is an attempt at giving the still nascent indian fashion design industry a serious corporate structure and to attract both local and international buyers of indian designer wear .
at this year 's fashion week - run by the fashion design council of india -lrb- fdci -rrb- - 58 designers will showcase their collections in shows featuring more than 50 of the country 's leading models .
leading designers include rohit bal , raghavendra rathore , tarun tahiliani , rajesh pratap singh , ritu kumar in an event expected to attract more than 15,000 visitors .
fdci executive director vinod kaul says the indian fashion industry is making global inroads .
" two years ago , representatives from -lsb- uk store -rsb- selfridges came for fashion week which led to the immensely successful bollywood promotion last summer .
" this year , one of our expected important guests is the president of celine -lsb- a major french fashion house -rsb- from the french luxury group lvmh . "
but observers wonder how international attention will translate into business .
growing interest amber tikari , deputy fashion editor at the indian edition of elle magazine says : " last year was england 's bollywood summer and selfridges capitalized on that .
but since then , how many indian designers have had regular orders from such stores ? "
" i think it will be a while before india fashion week gets serious coverage " amber tikari elle india edition deputy editor the indian clothing industry is estimated to be worth $ 12bn - half of it exports .
but the fashion design industry is still nascent and is estimated to be worth around $ 50m .
however , mr kaul feels that the industry has potential , and points to the fact that the number of designers exhibiting at the fashion week has increased from around 30 at the first event in delhi to almost double this year .
' i ca n't wear it ... '
rohit bal is one of india 's most famous designers and he says the west needs to look at indian fashion more seriously .
" i mean , cherie blair wore a sari the other day but she 's not going to wear it every day .
" every time i show my clothes in the west , the positive feedback is that ' its beautiful , its like being a princess ' .
" but the negative feedback is ' oh my god , i ca n't wear that ' .
" so we have to convert this negative feedback into them saying ' oh my god , i want to wear that and i can wear that ! " '
last year , as part of a show for omega watches , rohit bal 's creations were modelled on the catwalk in paris by leading tennis star anna kournokiva .
earlier , bal 's creations were modelled by pamela anderson for people for the ethical treatment of animals -lrb- peta -rrb- .

the future of project red dragon - and 3,000 welsh jobs - finally seemed secure in february this year when the defence aviation repair agency -lrb- dara -rrb- confirmed it would go ahead with a £ 77m aircraft maintenance centre near cardiff .
armed forces minister adam ingram had assured workers there , and in plants in scotland and england , that the ground-breaking scheme to refurbish and maintain raf planes had landed government approval .
but now the bbc has been told by senior sources within the mod that officials in the department intend to renege on the project .
but a ministry of defence spokesman said they were committed to the project .
" ministers stand by their commitment to red dragon and we are hardly going to ride roughshod over the investment we are making at st athan . "
following a high-level review , they have decided to service and repair planes at existing raf bases with immediate effect - going against original plans to send them to dara 's planned aviation park at st athan .
not only does this contradict earlier assurances by mr ingram but it threatens the very existence of dara - set up in 1999 as one of the government 's high-profile public-private partnerships - and its 4,000 employees in the uk .
dara 's future could only be guaranteed by project red dragon which included the building of the aerospace industry park at st athan to include a " super-hanger " which would have 47 bays to allow work on military fast jets .
it was hoped that , once underpinned by the mod contracts , civil aviation companies and other aviation businesses would use the services at st athan , potentially further jobs .
the fortunes of project red dragon carry with them 2,100 jobs at st athan , and 900 in sealand , flintshire , at the dara plant specialising in aeroplane electronics .
john smith , the mp for the vale of glamorgan , blamed " vested interests " in the raf for the jobs worry .
he said : " if true , i 'm absolutely astounded , it flies in the face of government policy over the last five years and the huge efforts that have taken place .
" the workforce at this site have performed miracles , they have sweated blood and they have delivered to become one of the most efficient workforces in the world .
" if somebody is now suggesting that you get rid of them , it 's absurd . "
but is not the first time doubts have been raised about the future of project red dragon .
in october last year , the transport and general workers ' union -lrb- tgwu -rrb- said the government was considering abandoning the plans to create the aviation repairs centre of excellence .
union spokesman jack dromey said it would be " outrageous " for the mod to back away from the scheme now it had been given the government 's blessing .
he said : " that would be absolutely wrong - not in the best interests of the royal air force , not in the best interests of a loyal workforce .
" we thought there was a bright future for st athan in south wales , with thousands of new jobs being created . "
an mod spokesman said an internal report had been completed but armed forces minister mr ingram had not yet read it .
two features set project red dragon project apart from other military aviation maintenance contracts since its unveiling in august 2002 .
the first is the planned construction of the " super-hangar " , designed specifically for the repairs of strike-force fast jets .
the second is that it will be the only western military site able to develop its aviation maintenance arm using finance raised from the private sector .

the organisation says 71 buildings have been added to the latest buildings at risk register while 96 have been removed .
the latest list includes broomfield house in enfield , north london , and crossness pumping station in bexley , south east london .
english heritage said london has about 40,000 listed buildings , of which around 2 % are at risk .
the register was first compiled in 1991 and 90 % of the buildings on that first register have been saved .
but english heritage said it did not have the resources to save some nationally important historic assets .
more resources needed philip davies , regional director for london , said : " we offered £ 4.5m in grant aid to buildings at risk in london last year , but this is a very small sum when you consider that many individual buildings , such as large churches or mansions in public parks like broomfield house , often need more than £ 1m each for repairs .
" if more heritage resources are not made available , many of london 's most important and vulnerable architectural icons will pass the point of no return . "
he said buildings often fell into the " at risk " category because of lack of money for maintenance when ownership changed or when the building was no longer needed for its original purpose .
broomfield house stands in its own park in enfield broomfield house , a 16th century listed grade ii house , has been damaged by a number of fires .
for centuries , it was a family home for a succession of city merchants .
in the 20th century it was a school , and later a health centre until it was damaged by fire in 1984 .
crossness pumping station , a 19th century grade i listed building , is described as a " spectacular cathedral-like building with magnificent victorian iron work " .
it has four beam engines by james watt and co and is currently being run by volunteers .
among the buildings removed from the list is eltham orangery near greenwich and st luke 's church , islington , which has been converted for use as a rehearsal space for the london symphony orchestra .
the register is intended to keep attention focused on neglected historic buildings and monuments .
it is designed to define the scale of the problem and to prioritise action by english heritage , local authorities , building preservation trusts and funding bodies .

english heritage said london has about 40,000 listed buildings , of which around 2 % are at risk .

" if more heritage resources are not made available , many of london 's most important and vulnerable architectural icons will pass the point of no return . "

more than half the hospitals in england took part in the survey , and 71 % of these said they had to dip into capital , or use other " one-off " sources such as the proceeds from the sale of assets to make ends meet .
on average , the trusts that responded to the survey for bbc radio 4 's today programme , had used £ 2.74 million of these funds last year .
the financial pressures are happening despite a massive injection of government cash into the health service .
wages and drugs trust bosses are blaming a variety of factors for their troubles .
the cost of medicines to the nhs is increasing fast , and bosses are having to find more money to cover national insurance payments and above-inflation pay rises for healthcare staff .
they also say that the pressure to meet national targets set by ministers - for example on reducing waiting times - is proving costly .
paul williams , president of the institute of healthcare management told the bbc : " there is an irony that despite record levels of expenditure on the health service across the uk , health organisations are finding it difficult to manage within available resources .
" this is due to many factors including the need to play ' catch-up ' on over 30 years of under-investment , a massive increase in expectations , new targets and policies , guidelines , increasing costs of disposables , new drugs and technology and a shortage of key staff . "
he added : " the transfer of capital to revenue to help balance the books should always been the haven of last resort . "
foundation worry john appleby , a health analyst with the independent think tank the king 's fund , told the bbc that new " foundation hospitals " - offered extra freedoms from whitehall - could find it harder to cope financially .
at the moment , many trusts take advantage of a " brokerage " system which allows them to borrow money from other parts of the nhs if they get into trouble .
independence from these arrangements could make it even tougher for foundation trusts to balance the books , he said .
he said : " it is n't clear how foundation trusts would deal with financial difficulties . "
dr liam fox , the shadow health secretary , said : " this survey shows in the starkest possible terms just how distorted the government 's priorities are .
" hospitals are trapped .
health ministers are determined to micromanage everything they do .
they impose a one size fits all blue print which takes no account of local circumstances . "
cancelled operations the government was criticised by the liberal democrats after it was revealed that the number of routine operations cancelled had risen by 22 % since labour came to power .
health spokesman dr evan harris said : " cancelled operations are a good way of measuring whether there is enough capacity - beds and staff - in the nhs .
cancelled operations go up when capacity goes down .
" the rise in cancellations since labour came to power shows that the shortages are being made worse by whitehall 's target culture . "
